#Tech4Good’s
not-for-profit partner organizations, who were trained on Google tools (like
Open Data Kit, Google Ads, My Maps, Tour Builder and Earth Tools
) over the last one year, to a one of a kind event, where different stakeholders from the development sector can learn from each other and potentially collaborate on projects for positive social impact.
This year’s Google – Tech4Good Summit is a special one-day conference that combines a hands-on technical workshop and a panel discussion hosted by the Google Earth Outreach team at the
Google India office in Bangalore on August 23, 2019.
The Summit is intended for technology enthusiasts in the development sector working on projects using tools to create new knowledge, raise awareness and enable action.

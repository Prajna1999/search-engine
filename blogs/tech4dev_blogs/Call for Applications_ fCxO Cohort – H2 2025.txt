==================================================

Project Tech4Dev is excited to open applications for the
2025 cycle
of our
Fractional CxO Program
‚Äî a unique opportunity for NGOs to embed experienced technology leaders and tech teams within their organisations for
6 to 12 months
.
This program is designed to co-create and set the organisation on the path towards implementing a
tech strategy aligned with organisational goals
through our learnings across the sector of common and pressing gaps :
Limited in-house capacity for technical product and project management
Growing interest in
AI/ML solutions
(e.g., voice-based interfaces for low-literacy communities)
Rising need for
data-driven decision making
and strategy
Difficulty in launching
agile pilots
and MVPs within traditional NGO structures
Ad-hoc consulting needs for ongoing tech/data efforts

A Proven Model: Fractional CxO + Tech/Data Team
In our latest cohort, we piloted a
Fractional Tech & Data Team
approach ‚Äî pairing a fCxO with a fractional tech team fulfilling roles of
product/program management, software development, data engineering/science, AI/ML engineering
to streamline execution.
The result? Agile, high-impact, cost-effective solutions leveraging existing frameworks but tailored to each NGO‚Äôs strategic goals.
What NGOs gain:
‚úÖ A clear technology and data roadmap aligned with their mission
‚úÖ Enhanced internal capacity for product and project execution
‚úÖ Evidence based decision making
‚úÖ Agile prototypes and scalable pilot solutions
Given the nature of our work, and the fact that tech is an enabler and follows the objectives of programs once aligned with government‚Äôs focus, the fCxO program has helped bring clarity, prioritize efforts and help ask the right questions prior to investing further resources. It has also helped position tech at the appropriate level in the organisation which is important to strengthen our approach and propositions, including internally.

I appreciate the ‚Äúpilot first‚Äù mindset that the fCxO has brought to encourage more open thinking and experimentation.

How the Program Works
üß†
Expertise
: Your NGO is paired with a seasoned Chief Technology/Data Officer (CxO) (12‚Äì16 hrs/week) for 6‚Äì12 months.
üß©
Custom Fit
: Each engagement is tailored ‚Äî from defining strategy to evaluating partners or building internal capacity.
‚öôÔ∏è
Optional Add-Ons
: Technology/Data/AI teams can be brought in as needed to accelerate prototyping or delivery.
NGO Eligibility
We‚Äôre looking for NGOs that:
Prioritise tech in their top 3 organisational goals
Active involvement of their CEO/senior leadership
Definitive organisational/program strategy and stable operational processes
Are not in emergency ‚Äútech crisis‚Äù mode
Committed to spending on technology towards enabling organisational outcomes
Cost Structure
We co-invest with
Tech4Dev covering part
of the program cost.
NGO contribution:
‚Çπ2 Lakhs/month
for a half-time (16 hours) fractional CxO + Tech Team (inclusive of GST).  The fractional CxO in coordination with the NGO will bring in tech resources as needed and manage the team and their hours during that time. For example, a rapid development of a prototype could have the fCxO contributing 8 hours/week and a senior tech resource (~5+ yrs experience) putting in 12 hours/week for a month, followed by the fCxO still at 8 hours/week + a tech resource (~3+ yrs experience)  at 8 hours/week and a project management resource (8 hours/week) for the next month as the project moves towards a full scale implementation with a vendor.

Field & Remote Work
Fractional CxOs & Tech team primarily work remotely but typically include:
‚úàÔ∏è 3‚Äì5 day onboarding visit in the first month
üöê Multiple short field visits during the engagement
(NGO covers travel/stay)
Ongoing Support & Peer Learning
All fCxOs connect weekly with Tech4Dev peers to share lessons, unblock issues, and collaborate. Cross-learning is built into the DNA of this program. Fractional CxOs might also pull in another fCxO to assist in a specific tech or data scenario as they may be better equipped based on the expertise area.

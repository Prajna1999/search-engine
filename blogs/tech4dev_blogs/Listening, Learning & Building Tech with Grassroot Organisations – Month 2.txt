==================================================

“We didn’t know where to start. But now we know what we need—and we know we’re not alone.”
This line, shared during one of our recent training check-ins, sums up the quiet but powerful shift we’ve seen over the past month.
In June, the
Tech4Dev Cohort for Chennai
, featuring HRF, WEEDS, TNDWWT, and Thendral Movement, entered a deeper phase of digital transformation. The basics were in motion. Now comes the real test: implementation and ownership.
From Training Rooms to Real Tasks
Following the third field visits in early June, each NGO dove into
hands-on training sessions
covering Canva, social media management, video editing, and data tracking.
Instead of watching slide decks, the teams were:
Creating content in
Canva Pro
, learning to use brand kits and design formats for certificates, newsletters, and social media posts.
Uploading trial content to
Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube
, experimenting with thumbnails and LinkedIn posts.
Editing videos using
Active Presenter
, getting used to timelines, audio tracks, and export settings.
Beginning to build
project-wise data folders
and simple MIS tools in Excel, moving away from cluttered or overpriced systems.
For one team, saving content into the right folder became a lightbulb moment. For another, finally understanding how to apply for Google Workspace without vendor delays brought relief.
Patterns That Emerged
Across all four organizations, we noticed a familiar pattern of requirements:
A need for
simplified data systems
tailored to their projects, not generic platforms.
The desire to manage
websites independently
, without being tied to unavailable vendors.
A focus on
training in small, digestible pieces
, instead of all-at-once tech setups.
And most importantly,
confidence-building over tool-building
.
Tiny Wins, Big Confidence
WEEDS drafted and scheduled their first Facebook post.
HRF edited their first awareness video with a voice-over.
TNDWWT reorganized their Google Forms and began testing MIS formats.
Thendral Movement got geo-tagged on Google and mapped their way back to digital visibility.
Each milestone wasn’t just a task, it was a confidence checkpoint. A step toward autonomy.
What We’re Learning
The biggest challenge isn’t the software, it’s the
mindset shift
. Vendors withholding credentials, organizations unsure about domain renewals, forms used as workarounds, and mobile-first content creation, all reflect a landscape where tech isn’t absent, but hasn’t yet felt like it belonged.
What’s working?
Weekly check-ins
and direct follow-ups
Pre-scheduled tasks
that allow practice and feedback
Personal rapport
and one-on-one handholding
This journey is not about shortcuts. It’s about showing that progress doesn’t need to be perfect, just consistent.
What’s Next
As we head into July, our focus is clear:
Complete final field visits and consolidate digital assets
Help NGOs move from
trial mode to real-world application
of tools
Finalize websites and data trackers
We’re not just setting up digital tools, we’re shifting mindsets.
And like most lasting change, it starts small.

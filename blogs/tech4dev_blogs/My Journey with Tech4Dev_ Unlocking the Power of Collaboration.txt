In today’s interconnected world, technology and collaboration are essential for driving positive social change. My journey with Tech4Dev began in February 2024 when I co-organized the Unconference: Beyond Data, Beyond Borders. This event, held in Nairobi, provided invaluable insights into Tech4Dev’s unique culture and the potential of its solutions for the East African social sector. I was particularly impressed by their commitment to community-centeredness, collaboration, and innovation. Inspired by their approach, I joined Tech4Dev in August of the same year.
Expanding Our Reach: Learning from India’s Scale
Joining Tech4Dev allowed me to focus on expanding our reach in East Africa. By leveraging my prior experience in the region’s social sector, I’ve been able to identify key challenges and opportunities. While the contexts differ, one unique element of the Indian civil society sector is the scale of its engagement. For example, Mumbai alone has 23 million people, while Kenya as a country has 40 million. This offers a unique opportunity for cross-learning, as even the smallest organizations in India interact with large numbers of communities. Take Glific, for example, which is currently being used by over 100 NGOs to reach and engage with 1.3 million people.
The Tech4Dev Ecosystem and Collaboration
Tech4Dev is a unique organization committed to equipping the civil society sector with the tools they need to create lasting social impact. The ecosystem offers a range of solutions designed to transform how nonprofits use technology and data. Collaboration is a cornerstone of Tech4Dev’s approach. We believe in supporting local innovation and acknowledging the agency of communities in solving complex issues. Our partnership with the East Africa Philanthropy Network is a testament to this commitment. By working together, we can share knowledge, resources, and best practices. The most powerful tool we have in addressing social issues is a focus on mutual partnership—on the relationships we build, the language we use, and the way we engage. Through organization-to-organization interactions and a commitment to co-creation, we can drive significant structural and systemic change in the social sector. This approach not only fosters a development model that is more inclusive and equitable but also equips communities to take ownership of their solutions.
The Future of Social Impact
I’m excited about the potential for technology to revolutionize the social sector. By leveraging data and AI, we can identify systemic inequalities and optimize resource allocation. As a member of the Tech4Dev team, I’m looking forward to contributing to our mission. Our upcoming global webinar on September 3 will provide an opportunity to showcase our work on Glific, an AI chatbot builder used by over 100 NGOs. By building strong relationships and tailoring our offerings to the specific needs of East African CSOs, we can create a lasting impact.

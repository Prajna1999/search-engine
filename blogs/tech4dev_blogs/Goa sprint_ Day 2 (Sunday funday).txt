==================================================

The second day of our Glific Sprint in Goa kicked off with an unexpected twis me waking up at 6 am. This surprising turn of events was the result of a lively discussion at the dinner table the previous night, where bets were placed on who would be the early riser. I wanted to see who would win the bet and I embraced the decision to wake up early and was rewarded with a breathtaking sunrise during our 45-minute walk to Baga beach.
The morning continued with a sense of excitement as we headed back to the hotel, aiming to be on time for a team-building exercise organized by Dasra at 9 am. To add a dash of thrill, being late incurred a fine of Rs. 125 per minute, keeping everyone on their toes.
The team-building exercise proved to be both entertaining and insightful. The exercises were designed to impart experiential learning through a series of engaging games that, at first glance, might seem childish but held deeper meanings.
Game 1: Attack-Rabbit-Wall
This game, a twist on rock-paper-scissors, required teams to make strategic choices to accumulate points. The objective was to encourage group consensus, strategic planning, and adaptability. Although our team didn’t emerge victorious, the experience was both enjoyable and enlightening.
Game 2: Caterpillar
In a nostalgic nod to childhood memories of picking teams for sports, two volunteers became captains and selected their teams. The objective was to form a human caterpillar using pipes and navigate a short distance without using hands. The challenges we faced, such as the pipes sticking to shirts and discomfort, prompted us to strategize and collaborate more efficiently. Despite being late to implement our strategy, the game concluded with a collective sense of achievement.
Game 3: Rollercoaster
With the task of moving a ball to a distant cup using half-cut pipes, the Rollercoaster game challenged our teamwork and adherence to rules. While we scored well, some instances of rule-bending were acknowledged, highlighting the importance of integrity in a team.
Game 4: Island Scenario
This scenario-based game divided the team into three groups, each facing unique challenges on their “island.” The objective was to reach a safe island while overcoming limitations like blindness, leglessness, or speechlessness. The unexpected twists and turns, including a betrayal that wasn’t part of the game, added a layer of fun and unpredictability to the experience.

The day concluded with a reflective session, where the consensus was that the team-building exercises were a success, fostering camaraderie and effective communication.
In the evening, we embarked on a group outing to multiple beaches. A bus journey filled with antakshari set the tone for a delightful evening. From Vagator beach’s beauty to the lively atmosphere of Anjuna beach, the day ended with dancing, swimming, good food, and a mesmerizing sunset.
Overall, Day 2 not only strengthened our team bonds but also provided valuable insights into effective collaboration and communication. The combination of team-building exercises and a group outing proved to be a well-rounded approach to fostering a positive team spirit.

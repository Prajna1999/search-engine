==================================================

We are super excited to the announce the
first Alpha
release of the
FundImpact
platform. The team has covered a long mile of 3 sprints over 45 days to achieve the first milestone! The FundImpact platform is envisioned to help social purpose organization in better
managing their funds, track project deliverable and report impact
to the concerned stakeholders. We are trying to bridge the gap between
Project Monitoring Tools
and the
Accounting tools
deployed by organizations in tracking progress of project commitments and funds; and ensure the donors are better informed.
FundImpact – Alpha 1 Release
Highlights of the features in this release are:
Register account on the platform and create projects
Organize Projects into Workspaces
Create Budget Targets of a Project and report their expenditure
Capture advance reporting tags on each transaction such as Grant Periods, Financial Year and Annual Year.
Multi-donor assignment to a Project
Create Project Targets and report achievements
Create Impact Indicators and report achievements
User configurable measurement units for deliverable and impact targets
Organize various target in their respective Categories
Project Dashboard to review overall progress on Fund Status, Deliverable and Impact achievements.
The Alpha 1 release has achieved a lot of functional features for the end user. There was commendable effort by the team who picked a new technology stack and quickly acquainted themselves. In fact, team was able to cover more in the first three sprints than originally planned without compromising on code quality and development practices.
Overview of the Technology Stack
We are using a robust technology stack to power FundImpact.
On Frontend, we are using
React.js
to design our user interfaces. To speed up things and deploy industry standard practices, we are using
Material-UI
(a popular React UI framework).
At Backend, we are using
node.js
based
Strapi.io
framework. Strapi has great off the shelf support for
GraphQL
. It has helped us in quickly developing APIs.
For database, we are using
PostgreSQL
.
DevOps for FundImpact
We have deployed
Netlify
for Continuous Integration.
SonarCloud
has been used for monitoring code quality.
The repo is hosted on Github. We decided to split the repo for frontend and backend to ease the development for frontend and backend teams. Repos can be accessed at following links –
FundImpact FrontEnd
and
FundImpact Backend
.
Way Forward
We have kept two more alpha releases in the next two months, before we launch a public access of the platform under Beta 1 release. This beta launch is planned for Mid of November.

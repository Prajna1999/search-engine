==================================================

Imagine this: just one year into my journey in India, still acclimating to the vibrant colors, sounds, and quirks of South India, when an opportunity arises to venture into the far-flung, rain-soaked, and almost mystical Northeast for my first company sprint with Tech4Dev. To Shillong—a place I’d dreamt of visiting—nestled in the hills of Meghalaya, steeped in mist and mystery. It was to be a week of discovery, camaraderie, and unforgettable moments. Not only was this my first sprint, but it was also an unexpected leap into the heart of a company I was just beginning to know.
Landing at Guwahati Airport, the excitement of being able to meet everyone I had worked with remotely hit me hard! Joining the Sprint Planning team with Radhika and Pritesh felt like returning to old roots but in a new, exciting form. With a past life in student councils and event organizing—from international Model United Nations to inter-university debate championships—I had always loved being part of events that bring people together. Volunteering for sprint planning, even without any prior sprint experience at T4D, felt like the right kind of challenge.
Radhika, a true veteran, guided us, and together we spun ideas into action: Sprint Bingo, the Scavenger Hunt, improv games for team-building, scheduling, excursions, and custom mugs. Each detail was refined over multiple rounds until it became something we could all be proud of. From day one, it was clear that this wasn’t just another work trip; it was a venture into the soul of Tech4Dev.
Then came the hackathon—a highlight of the sprint. Working on
OnboardMate
was a joy—an idea born from my desire to streamline parts of my own work, to automate the repetitive and routine. Collaborating with Jerome and Rohit was a masterclass in tech wizardry. Jerome—who could code with the dexterity of a concert pianist using Vim, no IDE in sight—was inspiring in his retro approach. Rohit, our Head of Engineering, turned everything into an adventure. With the kind of chaotic, electric energy only he possesses, he spurred us on, once even declaring that we would be the winners—and turns out, we were! Together, we built a tool that was more than just a sprint hack; it was a solution to enhance our workflows. Thanks to their help and support, we snagged both the
Technical Wizardry
and
Overall Championship
awards.
Outside the hackathon, the trip was filled with moments that made it special. One unforgettable night, we celebrated Erica’s anniversary with us, filling the evening with energy as we dressed in festive attire and danced to classic desi hits. Having missed my family’s annual dandiya celebration this year, this night made up for it tenfold. From the laughter to the music to just letting loose with the team, it was a night that felt like home away from home.
Meeting Lobo, the visionary behind Tech4Dev, was another memorable part of the trip. His dedication to the sector, to creating visible impacts for clients, was both inspiring and energizing. One morning, I set out on a long walks with Lobo, Rajeev and Thomas, testing the limits of my fitness on the steep inclines as the mist lifted to reveal sweeping landscapes. We talked about work, plans, ideas—or simply let the quiet be our companion. It was clear how much Lobo cares about the team, the clients, and the broader purpose that guides our work. In addition, being surrounded by such fitness enthusiasts, hearing about the insane number of kilometers they walked everyday (looking at you Thomas) was immensely motivating!
And then there were the excursions—each one as unforgettable as the last. Hiking to Laitlum Canyon, I felt a sense of profound smallness amidst the stunning expanse of nature. The vastness left me humbled and a little breathless, both from the climb and the sweeping beauty around. Devi kept me company as we ventured off the beaten path, mingling with horses, almost wanting to get lost! Gaming nights with Siddhant, Shamoon, Ishan, and Nair (where I got to flex my skills as Baraka in Mortal Kombat) were filled with shenanigans and laughter. Including strolling through the bustling Police Bazaar late into the night, each experience added something special to the journey.
One evening, we went to a club to hear
Never End
, a phenomenal band from Upper Shillong, play covers of classic rock songs. Rohit proved to be the life of the party, leading the charge on the dance floor to “Sweet Child o’ Mine” and “It’s My Life.” For a moment, we were not colleagues, not tech professionals—just a group of people lost in the music, in the thrum of the night.
Evenings at the hotel bar gave us all a chance to unwind and connect beyond work. Erica, Siddhant, Diana, and Gautam shared stories of meeting their significant others, while Rohit’s eclectic playlist set the vibe as Thomas, Anto, and Nair shared stories about bands I’d never heard of. Each conversation revealed a different layer of the team I was still getting to know—from Krishna, or “KP” as she had been mentioned to me, to Shamoon, Akansha, and Nishika, each of whom I bonded with over a patchwork of topics.
Returning each night to the comfort of the Taj Vivanta was a kind of surprise I hadn’t anticipated. I’d expected a modest stay, maybe a motel. But the Taj’s impeccable service, the food that catered perfectly to my diet, and of course, the cheesecake—which I may have indulged in once (or twice) too many—made me feel spoiled. My roommate, Sangeeta, was the cherry on top—teaching me dance moves, sharing stories, and laughing off my night-owl tendencies even when I’d be up typing away at the laptop as she slept. She was a joy to share the space with, even apologizing to me the day she got sick!
A big part of the sprint was the feeling of being truly supported. During the retrospective, everyone took the time to reflect not just on what we’d accomplished but on how we could improve. I walked away with more than just new ideas for the next steps—I gained a bird’s-eye view of Tech4Dev’s future and the role I could play in it. I felt like my happiness and my growth, mattered here, and that made me feel more productive, more motivated than ever. Every interaction, every laugh, every bug solved, every song sung, and every game played added layers to my experience here.
I came back not only with memories but with a newfound sense of belonging and purpose. As I look forward to future sprints, I know now that it’s more than just the work. It’s the people, the shared memories, the laughter, and the challenges that make it all meaningful. Here’s to many more moments like these, to more sprints, and to the team that turned Shillong from a mere destination into a home away from home.

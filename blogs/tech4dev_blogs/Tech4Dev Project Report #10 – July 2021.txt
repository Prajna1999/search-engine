Summary
2021
has been a roller coaster ride that does not seem to end in some parts of the world. While the US seems to have returned to regular life, Q2 2021 impacted both urban and rural India harshly. A significant percentage of personnel from both our NGO and software partner networks were directly or indirectly impacted by COVID. This led to our slowest quarter since our inception from an outreach and deployment perspective.
We continue our focus on our open-source platforms.
FundImpact
(FI), our platform that helps social organizations track project funds, deliverables, and impact on the ground.
Dhwani RIS
has been working with NGOs like
Pradan
,
Shelter Associates
,
Medha
to extend FI to their needs.
Glific
has continued onboarding more NGOs onto the platform. We onboarded 4 NGOs this quarter, and we hope to onboard a few more as the pandemic in India recedes. As of June, we have
24 NGOs
on the platform. We work closely with our partner NGOs in extending the platform to meet their needs. The case study in this report shows how one of our partners served their community and network effectively via Glific.
Highlights and Misses
Our work with Internet Freedom Foundation and Civic Data Lab in open data
helped in the Supreme Court decision
that issued notice & directed the Union of India to investigate why IT Act Sec 66A cases are still being registered and file a counter-affidavit within 2 weeks.
Glific
v1.8 was released in early July. A new version of the
Glific Product Video
along with other videos is available on
our youtube channel
.
Glifics consulting practice started in Q2 2021. We are working with multiple NGOs to meet their specific requirements, like
Digital Green to build an audio chatbot
.
Our financials are in a good state due to reduced expenses in the past 15 months. This will enable our current funding to support us for an additional year.
Tech4Devs fifth cohort was held during Q2, 2021 at the height of the pandemic. Some of the NGOs selected during this cohort had to withdraw due to pandemic issues.
Our three open-source platforms: Avni, FundImpact, and Glific had a slow quarter in onboarding new NGOs. We also refrained from actively marketing to NGOs in Q2 2021, due to the impact of the pandemic on their staff and other higher priorities.
We welcome Ravi Dronamraju into our funding circle.
Glific Case Study – Reap Benefit
Reap Benefit is one of the leading NGOs that have really used the WhatsApp chatbot system to great advantage. We have been interacting and learning from them as much as we can so as to provide leverage to other NGOs from the good things they have been able to do. In the past 6 months, they have reached out to 40,000+ beneficiaries, exchanging 1m+ messages. Along with a good testament to the Glific platform, its a bigger testament to the program delivery problem we had set out to solve for the social sector.
Glific has provided a really simple, customizable tool to meet most of our use cases, said Gauthamraj, chatbot program lead at Reap Benefit. This is a big achievement for us. Were planning to onboard 50K more citizens” he said, sharing their near future plans. The Reap Benefit team has been able to make 2X improvements in their programs with Glific as compared to other competitive solutions used in the past. The biggest benefit to them has been the ability to customize the platform such as when they built Google Sheets integration with Glific to serve COVID-affected families. These implementations further validate features that we should make available to a larger set of NGOs, making Glific a go-to choice.
It’s been a bit more than a year since the pandemic, and our decision to devote most of our energy and resources to our open-source platforms, Glific and FundImpact. In retrospect, this was the right decision, and well spend some time reflecting on what worked and what did not. So a random, semi-structured walk of our journey in the past year.

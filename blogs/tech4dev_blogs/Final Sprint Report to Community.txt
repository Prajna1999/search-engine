This was an email sent to the larger tech4dev community. Recording it as a blog post for archival purposes.
For those in the US, we hope you had a restful and relaxing Thanksgiving weekend with friends and family. Iâ€™m super thankful to all our funders and partners for giving us the freedom and flexibility to do what we think might work and be beneficial to the sector. Youâ€™ll truly rock and the world needs more funders like you ðŸ™‚ Also grateful to have a partner like
Colored Cow
who went above and beyond to make this event a reality.
We just wrapped up the Tech4Dev Tehri sprint with a group of 35 folks across 9 organizations from 4 countries involved in the social sector space in India. The in-person event was our first after two years with the main goals being:
Bring the community together at a great location â€“ relax, chat and have a fun time
Learn from each other and get more exposure on what other organizations are working on and why
Few scheduled activities â€“ give people ample space and time to do their own work and have conversations as needed
Introductions and getting started
We succeeded in achieving what we set out to do and are quite pleased with the results. In general there is a certain nervousness as you plan such things, wondering if it will even work. It was great to see that it worked beyond our wildest expectations.
All the participating organizations
blogged about their experience or some specific day.
A few blog posts that give an overview of Â the entire experience are:

We have worked closely with the GiveIndia team consuming existing APIs along with developing APIs as per the need of the project scope. Integrating it to GiveIndias server environment also went well enabling us to deploy code to their servers while we do second round of UAT. This was a very important step since we wanted to see if there were any glitches that we may face.
When the application was demoed to the business team of GiveIndia, the impact that the application can bring was highly appreciated. The main intent of developing the application  was to enable seamless data collection & regularize report submissions from NGOs which we have nailed very aptly.
The next following demo with NGO users further opened up a lot more possibilities & enhancements that can be done in future. We are currently working in close collaboration with team GiveIndia & application is undergoing thorough UAT NGO users who are using it in a staging environment to list out possible enhancements that they might need.

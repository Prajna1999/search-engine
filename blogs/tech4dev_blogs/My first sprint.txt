==================================================

My first sprint happened in Goa, a place I’ve been wanting to visit for years.Thanks to the Tech4dev team organizing a sprint in Goa, I got to experience it. I’ve only been with the team for a month, so I was pretty anxious before the sprint. I had mixed feelings because I wasn’t sure what a sprint was and how things would unfold.
Arriving at the airport on the 19th, nervousness took over, but meeting welcoming people at the hotel helped calm my nerves. The next day began with an opening circle, allowing me to finally meet the entire team in person. It was a different feeling from our virtual meetings.
Quarterly product reviews for Glific, Avni, Dalgo, and Fcxo followed the opening circle, providing insights into our strengths and areas for improvement. The Techie for Dev award ceremony surprised me with the “budding star” award, despite being a recent addition to the team.
Team-building activities by Outdoors Mantras included the caterpillar walk and roller coaster, although the island activity under the hot sun was less enjoyable. Exploring Goa with my roommate, Akansha, was a delightful experience, especially watching the sunset by the beach.
Educational sessions on important policies by Dinella and Uhanjali followed, shedding light on the principles and regulations of the organization. The ‘Chai pe Charcha’ event, a sales activity to connect with local NGOs, initially made me nervous as the first point of contact. However, meeting and greeting NGOs made me more comfortable, and the event turned out to be a success.
The opening circle with NGOs featured a fun activity, allowing us to connect with new people and learn about their organizations and motivations in the social sector.
Engaging in the Glific sprint and DCP simultaneously, my focus was on Glific. Additionally, I was responsible for social media photography. Sessions covered the auto-translate feature, NGO presentations, and peer learning tables.
The last day included a tech topic by Tejas on LLM vs LLM, providing clarity for someone like me without a tech background. NGO talks introduced me to INREM, Bandhu, and Civis chatbots. A session on the future of the platform gathered ideas from the NGO community. Abhishek Nair gave Glific NGOs the lowdown on Dalgo with a quick presentation.
Post-lunch sessions were tiring, but the 5-minute activities by the team were refreshing and fun. The sprint concluded with a review session, where everyone shared their thoughts.
In the evening, we had a beach party where we could chat casually outside of work. It was awesome seeing Arun singing so enthusiastically during karaoke and really enjoying it. We also had a great time talking and dancing with a lot of people from NGOs.
I’d like to express my gratitude to Lobo for emphasizing the importance of continuous learning. Sharing my experience with him and receiving valuable insights was a great feeling. Erica and Radhika have been supportive since my first day, and having face-to-face discussions with them about my work and overall progress has been enjoyable.
Akhilesh, Shamoon, and Siddhant were always there to help with my minor doubts, creating a space where I felt comfortable asking even the simplest questions without embarrassment. Sangeeta provided valuable insights into support work, helping me understand certain aspects better.
Krishna and Tejas, who were extensively involved in organizing the entire sprint, demonstrated tremendous dedication. I witnessed them working tirelessly from morning till night. It became a running joke to tease Amisha about her morning walks, but there was a surprising day when she even went for a walk.
We also had envelopes with our names on a wall, and everyone had to write a note of appreciation or share their thoughts. Even for this envelope activity, I didn’t anticipate receiving anything. However, when I was on my way back to Delhi, I opened my envelope and read the notes. It felt really special, and some notes were anonymous. Now, I’m curious to find out who wrote what.
The entire sprint was an awesome experience. I learned a lot and met many people, although I couldn’t chat much with some due to their busy schedules. Looking forward to getting to know everyone better in the next sprint.

==================================================

For the last 12 months weâ€™ve worked with more than ten clients and what weâ€™ve learned from them is that everyone is collecting data from multiple sources and theyâ€™re not able to consolidate their data to get a holistic view of their programs. From the initial POCâ€™s which we did weâ€™ve identified the most common data collection tool which Non Profit uses and weâ€™ve built a pipeline so that they can pull their data easily from these sources.
Dalgo offers 300+ connectors like google sheet, salesforce and file(CSVâ€™s) on top of it from our learnings from different orgs
weâ€™ve built
SurveyCTO
,
Commcare
, KoboToolbox,
AVNI
, PaperSurvey and Glific
. Weâ€™ve been using Airbyte under the hood and weâ€™ve contributed back to the platform to help and grow the ecosystem.
AVNI PR Is merged on Airbyte Platform
We always try to contribute to opensource platforms and so far 3 out of 6 is merged on airbyte platform. This year our plan is to merge existing connector to airbyte as part of our c4gt collaboration.
What does Dalgo Platform offer compared to other tools?
300+ sources
and custom connector development
No cap on
no. of users
using the platform. You can onboard as many.
DBT integration
to handle the transformation and building models. Integrated with Github so you can track whoâ€™s changing the models.
Orchestration tool
which lets you schedule your pipelines according to your needs.
No cap on number of
connections and sources
. So you make as many you want
Access to any new feature release and weâ€™re targeting quite a few things on our
Roadmap
Five hours of Support for the platform and weâ€™ve a Discord channel where you can ask any questions.
Superset Intergration with DALGO
Weâ€™ve integrated superset mainly because its opensource and when its opensource we can control or build new functionality. This is what we offer if you choose superset as your visualization tool
Again no cap there on the number of users using the superset.
Weâ€™re also offering superset usage dashboard which gives you
List of user on the platform
Active users
List of dashboards
No. of user accessing the dashboard
No. of visits per user
The next big feature releases
UI for Transformations
We started facing lot of challenges with our NGOâ€™s clients where they didnâ€™t have enough technology people or skill in their team and some of the common challenges weâ€™ve been seeing was
DBT installation and working with sql.
Modeling of the data on scale.
Not able to add new source to dbt or pipeline and not able to do transformation easily.
Weâ€™ve integrated DBT in our platform which doesnâ€™t do much for a NGO user.
After this, we decided to work on UI for transformation which is very common in lot of data tools and as a team we worked on the plan to build this and the approach we took was the learning from our previous experience with lot of DBT models weâ€™ve written for SHRI, STIR, SNEHA and LAHI. Collectively we might have written over 250+ models and we picked most common features from this which you can read about
here
.
This is how it looks like how you can design models now and Iâ€™m expecting my team to write a more detailed blog on this ðŸ™‚
2
. Weâ€™ve been focusing on
Data insights and Data quality
features for a NGO user so they can get minimal information from their data at the start and they can start thinking about how to make a model in a better way.
3.
Another feature weâ€™re working on is
RBAC(role based access control)
for a NGO user which you can read about
here
. This has come up with a few NGOs weâ€™ve worked with to give limited access to certain users which we thought was a great feature to have and a very common feature in any ETL tool.
Weâ€™re very motivated to take this platform to the next level so please reach out to us if we you think Dalgo can help and solve your Data integration and pipeline problems.

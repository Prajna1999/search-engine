==================================================

The Glific team is happy to announce the arrival of v0.2, a significant step forward
from v0.1
, with a broad array of new features and improvements. For the uninitiated,
Glific
is our open-source, two-way communication platform that allows organizations to communicate with their beneficiaries at scale (100+) in an intuitive manner.
You can watch the demo of the main features in v0.2 in this video

Highlights of v0.2
Integration with
FlowEditor from Nyaruka
. This gives the NGO the power to customize and build multiple flows easily for the system.
Easy to send the same message to different contacts via speed-sends
This version focussed on ensuring that the interface matched the design specifications
Improved interfaces to create tags and hsm message templates.
Better Search capability, including the ability to manage collections of chats/contacts. (e.g. Unread, Not Responded etc)
Highlights from a developer perspective
Sustained Focus on Code Quality, Code Documentation and Continuous Integration
Ensuring the backend exposes clean and well defined APIs
Integration of a Continuous Deployment pipeline. This will allow us to onboard new users and have a demo server up and running by mid month

On a lighter note, in my visit to Mangalore for the face-to-face, Dr Abhay, head of department of community medicine and our PoC took me around the city. And it was a delight to visit one of these grand ice-cream parlours which I thought are something quite unique to the city. They have some amazing varieties. While ‚Äò
Gadbad
‚Äò is most popular I liked their ‚Äò

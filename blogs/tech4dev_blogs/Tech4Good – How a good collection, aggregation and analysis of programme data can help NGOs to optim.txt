==================================================

Meet Narasamma who works with
Jagrutha Mahila Sanghatane (JMS)
â€“ a small, growing and impactful collective of inspiring dalit women agricultural workers engaged in the protection and promotion of human rights of dalit women. She speaks about how technology is helping document and measure the impact of her work at JMS.
Grassroots and remote NGOs like JMS, are either not collecting any data about their work or have been collecting data on paper. Such paper data is difficult to aggregate and analyse in any meaningful way. For example, It will take Narasamma?s team many days to go through paper forms of 1000 beneficiaries of a programme and find out who is yet to receive a crucial counselling session from her team. This is time that could have been spent meaningfully on other important work. There are also instances of paper files being completely destroyed during natural calamities like fire, cyclone. Imagine having evidence and documentation of decades of impactful work being wiped out like that.
A good collection, aggregation and analysis of programme data can help NGOs to optimize their services to beneficiaries and improve the quality of outcomes. Donors are also increasingly asking NGOs to measure and share the impact of their work through data collected from programmes. Good data practices can help NGOs communicate the evidence of their impact to donors and increase access to much needed funds.
NGOs believe that such robust data platforms are expensive, hard to learn and maintain. This is not true anymore! As Narasamma so beautifully says â€“ today technology is leveling the playground for everyone. Whether you are illiterate or a researcher, a global NGO or a small NGO with no resources â€“ technologies like smartphones and apps are helping them amplify their social impact like never before.

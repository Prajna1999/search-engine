==================================================

When Krishna told me,
“We have two new joinees, and both will be part of the product team,”
my instant reaction was,
Wooohhh, wow!
I am always excited when someone new joins — they bring fresh energy, new perspectives, and a whole new vibe to the organisation.
Then she asked,
“Would you like to be the buddy for both of them?”
and I smiled and said,
Of course, I would be happy to.
Inside, I felt quite excited and confident this time about helping them settle in.
This time, it was Fawas and Tanu — two different personalities, two different styles, but the same curiosity in their eyes on Day 1.
As their buddy, I knew I would be guiding them through the first steps — answering questions, sharing little tips, and making sure they felt right at home.
Somewhere in between my initial calls and Discord chats with Fawas and Tanu, I had a little déjà vu.
It took me back to last year when Priyesh joined. He came in with so much energy, doing his best on each task with determination. Watching him grow from a newcomer to a confident contributor has been one of my proudest buddy moments.
Back to the present — when I watch Tanu and Fawas, there’s something in the way they speak and ask questions that feels so genuine.
Fawas made me realise the importance of fresh thinking. His approach showed me that sometimes, a different perspective can simplify things I might have been overcomplicating.
Fun fact:
He is also a great photographer — now that he is part of the Tech4Dev tribe, we can expect some top-notch candid shots at our sprints!
Tanu’s conversations with me reminded me how powerful active listening can be. She took her time to understand before speaking, and when she did share, it was always thoughtful and full of insight.
Fun fact:
Tanu’s creativity is unmatched — give her FigJam and she will be coming up with  beautiful designs like magic.
Priyesh taught me that adaptability and consistency can take you a long way. He never hesitated to ask questions, and he reminded me that learning is a journey, not a race.
Fun fact:
He is all-rounder — incredibly detail-oriented, and also a terrific actor. His “
Kanpur accent with paan in mouth
” wala acting deserves a stage show!
My key learnings from this buddy journey:
Be curious, patient, and a good listener – keep asking why and how, remember that everything takes its own time to click, and try to step into a newcomer’s shoes.
Be open-minded – new people can teach you as much as you teach them.
Trust your inner voice – if something feels off, pause and rethink.
Being a buddy isn’t just about teaching tasks. It’s about showing the
why
behind it, giving confidence to ask any question, and celebrating every small win. It’s also about being there when things get tricky — whether it’s a confusing process, a missing doc, or shifting priorities.
Now, a few weeks in, I can already see Fawas and Tanu finding their rhythm, just like Priyesh did last year. And I know that, one day, they will be the ones guiding someone new, passing on the same warm welcome they received.

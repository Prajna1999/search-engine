==================================================

At Tech4Dev weâ€™ve started working on the
Development Data Platform
(DDP). In short, this allows an NGO to aggregate data from multiple data sources into a unified data warehouse. The data here can be analyzed and visualized directly via the platform. Visually, this looks like:
If you want more details on the above, more information is available in the following documents
DDP Concept Note
DDP Primer
Weâ€™ve been working with two of Indiaâ€™s leading NGOs on a Proof of Concept of the above scheme and are quite pleased with the results so far. Weâ€™d like to add another 3-5 NGOs to help us validate our platform and add new features that are useful across the sector.
Key requirements for the NGO
You have a mature and robust data collection process
You have a good sense of your data and the information youâ€™d like to glean from it
Your data helps influence and guide your interventions in the future. i.e. your data is useful from a programmatic and/or research perspective
You need the ability to house all your data in one unified place
What does the NGO get in return?
Pro-bono support and assistance in getting started with DDP
Once deployed, you will have a robust data pipeline
Assistance in building good visualizations for your program
Hand-holding and support, every step of the way ðŸ™‚
Our love and gratitude forever ðŸ™‚
Our expectations
You will have one person who had a good understanding of the needs and will be the main point of contact (PoC) for your NGO
Your NGO will be responsible for the operational and monthly hosting costs. We expect this to be around INR 15K ($200)
The PoC will meet with the DDP team twice a week
Our goal is to wrap up the pilots three months from start

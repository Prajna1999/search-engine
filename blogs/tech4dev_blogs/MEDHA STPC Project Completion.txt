==================================================

We have completed the work on creating
Medha STPC platform
which allows managing student data, training and placement activities. For the last few weeks, the project was extensively tested by Medha team and a controlled group of users. Overall, it went well and feedback received has been incorporated in the platform.
We have completed the handover process and provided the necessary project documentation to the Medha Team.
Here are the key features that were implemented in the project.
Role-based Access Control
Administrative module
College and Student Management functionality
Events Management
Training and Activity module
Comprehensive Feedback module based on roles
Dashboard / Reporting as per role
Data migration from the legacy system
This project was built in collaboration with
Maverick Labs
team and it was great fun working and solving some tricky problems during the implementation of this project. We learned a lot from each other.
Lastly, I would like to thank Arshul, Devanshu and Medha Team for their corporation during the project.
There are already in talks about phase 2 of this project, so looking forward to it.

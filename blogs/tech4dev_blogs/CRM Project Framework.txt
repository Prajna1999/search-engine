==================================================

We were analyzing past Tech4Dev projects including the project in the last 2 cohorts and found that there were few projects which were CRMish in nature. Hence, we thought if there was a basic framework/tools/CRM app it would help and save a lot of initial work done by various implementing partners.
Hence, we had a code sprint during our face to face meeting in November to brainstorm and evaluate various options.
This was the sprint agenda:

After experimenting with the various options we have shortlisted the following toolset to be used for projects in the next cohort that meet criteria.
Frontend: React
Backend: Strapi.io, PostgreSQL
We already have a few projects that fall into this category for the second cohort. So we will keep everyone updated here on the progress for the same.

==================================================

The
Glific
,
ColoredCow
,
Dost
and
Avanti Fellows
teams are hosting an open source sprint in the wonderful mountains of
Tehri, Uttarakhand
where ColoredCow has offices. The sprint will be a combination of UI/UX design, architecture, documentation, testing and coding.
The goal is to get a few teams together to work in the same location for a week making progress on their respective projects with their team. Weâ€™ll take the opportunity of being together to schedule multiple talks daily to learn about each otherâ€™s work and potential collaborations. We would love it if more teams would be interested in joining us and participating in this experiment.
Project Tech4Dev will partially cover the cost of accommodation and food in Tehri. We will also offer travel stipends to individuals who need it. Once the projects are confirmed, we will invite a few NGOs to come and work jointly with us on these projects.

Let us know
if your team is interested in taking part in this event. We do think it will be a fun and worthwhile experience and we could learn from each other. Happy to get on a quick call to answer any questions.
Rumor has it that the Colored Cow and Avanti Fellow teams are planning on cooking some fabulous multi-course dinners as part of the sprint in the evening ðŸ™‚

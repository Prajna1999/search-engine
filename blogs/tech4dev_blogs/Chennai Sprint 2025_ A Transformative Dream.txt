==================================================

Having joined Tech4Dev last November, the Mahabalipuram sprint was my first experience of a community gathering with the organization. It was more than just work—a time to meet people I had only seen on Zoom calls, a chance to explore the humans behind the roles I had been interacting with, and to truly understand what the organization is trying to achieve.
The first day started with blaring alarms that my roommate had set (and didn’t bother waking up to). The shock of those half an hour’s worth of a gazillion different soundtracks made sure I got out of bed and moved out ASAP, forgetting the travel exhaustion from the previous day.
As the days went by, I had the chance (or rather, as part of my job and the plan I created) to interact with the Tech4Dev leadership, the team, Dalgo, and the NGOs that had gathered for Chai Pe Charcha and the FCxO and Dalgo sprints.
Talking to each of them not only gave me insights into how and why the organization exists but also a sense of what and who drives them toward the social sector.
Starting with the NGOs at the Chai Pe Charcha event and the
Dalgo
and
FCxO
sprint, I interacted with representatives from
Bhumi
,
SNEHA
,
Satya Special School
, and many others. These organizations, with their large-scale operations, were navigating the tech landscape to further their impact and streamline processes for efficient resource use. Spending the day with the FCxOs and the Dalgo team, they were able to shape their problem statements into simpler formats—making it easy to solve them with a line of code, AI, or even simple tricks using Canva or otherwise. This not only gave them the confidence to explore tech but also an initiation into its possibilities. Some even shared specific use cases of how Dalgo had cut down turnaround times for data visualization and ingestion in sensitive issues like domestic violence and maternal and child health. Others used it for better representation of their work to donors, providing quick insights.
For the FCxO program, these NGOs shared how the technologists became more like confidants than consultants—guiding them with solutions that were sometimes operational and didn’t even require tech or helping them build connections they never thought possible.
Moving on from these sessions (and rushing to find time with the team busy engaging with NGOs and each other), I managed to grab moments with them. The interactions from these catch-ups were as informational as they were soulful. For instance,
Devi
shared how her corporate and education background now helps her stay patient with NGOs and offer simple solutions to problems they see as colossal.
Antony
mentioned how his dream has shifted from wanting a fancy lifestyle, coming from the startup space, to now desiring a simple life of meaning.
Erica
shared that her journey with Tech4Dev has felt like the stars aligning each time, enabling them to work with the best people with the purest intentions. It was like they had all come together through some sense of a shared dream.
But that wasn’t all. I pushed myself (as I always do) to explore the city in the late evenings and early mornings. Mahabalipuram had a lot to offer, and for a travel enthusiast like me, it was a race against time to capture as many conversations and visit as many temples and beautiful places as possible. Every morning, I stepped out (thankfully without alarms blaring), exploring the serene Shore Temple by the beach, the Five Rathas, Krishna’s Butter Ball, and about 15 other marvelous stone carvings and structures. I also attended the annual folk dance festival organized by the government.
One of the guidebooks mentioned a trip to Kanchipuram (the city of Kanjeevaram sarees and the Kamakshi Temple), and I just had to make it happen. One evening, after work, I packed a small bag and headed to the city, planning everything on the go—from the hotel to the places I’d visit. The next morning, I woke up at 5 AM and made my way to the Kamakshi Temple, then rushed to Ekambeshwaram, followed by a Vishnu temple and the Chitragupt temple. I even squeezed in a quick 15-minute stop at a saree store to buy Kanjeevaram sarees (my mom was very happy!) before heading back to Mahabalipuram by 11 AM—just in time to not miss work.
With minimal sleep and a fulfilled task checklist, I packed my stuff and prepared to leave. That’s when a colleague remarked how it felt like we had just arrived, and now it was already time to go. Reflecting on his thought, I realized how the trip had been dreamlike—a transformative journey filled with temple runs, cherished moments with colleagues over German cookies (which were like bricks, but we still gobbled them up), and work that felt more like fun.

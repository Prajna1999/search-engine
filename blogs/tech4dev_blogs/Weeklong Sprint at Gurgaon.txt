==================================================

As Glific continues to expand, it already has over 40 NGO partners and is in talks with many more. Kickstarting this quarter, we continue in the spirit of our sprints where the entire Glific team meets in person and invites our partner NGOs as well for a weeklong sprint to learn more about their use cases and difficulties, and to assist them in completing a few items from their future to-do list.
For this sprint, we were hosted by the
ColoredCow
team at their Gurgaon office from 11th April 2022 to 15th April 2022.

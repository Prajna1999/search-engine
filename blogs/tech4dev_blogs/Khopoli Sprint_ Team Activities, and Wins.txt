==================================================

It took me almost more than 4 years of building up the courage to finally write something straight from the heart. Yes, you read that right.
No one ever held me back. In fact, I was constantly cheered on and encouraged to follow my passion. Writing has always been close to my heart. I was that teen who filled notebooks with stories, poems, and random thoughts (and let’s be honest, I still feel like that teenager at heart. Somewhere along the way, life got busy, and I lost touch with that creative spark. But this team sprint in Khopoli  it’s been different. It brought a wave of self-reflection, a touch of nostalgia, and most importantly a nudge to reconnect with the writer in me.
Let’s dive deeper into what happened and how it all went to get a better picture.
Bias session that sparked reflection
We had an online session on unmasking unconscious bias by
Sama
in the month of April, and during the team sprint in Khopoli, we continued with an in-person session – part two of the online session. This time, it felt different. Being surrounded by the entire team brought a more personal touch to the experience.
We started with a
Human Bingo
game, an unexpected way to break the ice and get to know each other. The game was simple, find people who match the statements on the paper and write their name. One of the statements in the Bingo game was: A team member who doesn’t speak up during meetings despite having some points to share. A few teammates  came to me asking about it, and wrote my name on the statement box and I replied, ‘No, that’s not me. But later, I found myself reflecting on why it came across that way to my teammates. It made me think whether I sometimes hold back my thoughts in group settings. I used to feel that it’s completely okay not to speak up if there’s nothing meaningful to add. However, the murmuring in the room made me pause and think again and again. It gave me a subtle nudge, and I realized that I need to be more open and expressive in group settings instead of holding myself back.
Still I had hesitation, my mind had multiple thoughts, should I grab this opportunity to speak up or let it go. But my inner voice was speaking to me and giving me a familiar doha that  instantly came to my mind:
“Kaal Kare So Aaj Kar,
Aaj Kare So Ab,
Pal Mein Pralaya Hoyegi,
Bahuri Karoge Kab.”
It was a sudden push, I wanted to take that chance. I kept talking to myself in my mind.
This is just our internal team, and if I can’t speak here, how will I represent on bigger stages like NGO events, accelerators, or city meetups? I have always dreamed of leading sessions and going global, representing. It’s time to stop overthinking, trust your heart, and give it a shot.
AAL IZZ  WELL!
Team activities and realizations
Team Activity 1: Case Study Discussions
The first exercise brought us into action with different case studies. Each group was given a unique case study to discuss, analyze, and summarize. We were divided into teams, with each group working on real-life scenarios (case studies). This hands-on approach encouraged quick thinking and teamwork to present our collective insights.
Team Activity 2: Discussing respectful and disrespectful behaviors
For the second activity, we were reshuffled into new teams, allowing us to work with different members. This time, we discussed common respectful and disrespectful behaviors in various contexts, including:
Communication
Physical Space & Personal Boundaries
Giving and Receiving Feedback
Online Interactions
These discussions helped us gain insights into how behaviors can impact collaboration and the importance of maintaining respect in diverse settings.
I represented my team on both the activities, articulating our discussions despite having my initial fears of stumbling or not being able to express myself well. Overcoming this fear of public speaking was a significant achievement, as I had always worried about not meeting my team’s expectations or fumbling through the presentation. After the activities many of my teammates came up to me and appreciated me for speaking up and sharing my thoughts—it made me feel on top of the world that day.
Team Activity 3: Move to Your Opinion
The last activity, the most energetic part, was when we had to move physically to designated spots—’Agree,’ ‘Strongly Agree,’ or ‘Disagree’—based on statements given to us.
A simple activity, but it led to some intense discussions and reflections.
Key Takeaways
This sprint at Khopoli wasn’t just a series of activities, it was a journey of self-discovery. Stepping up to represent my team, despite my fears of public speaking, was a big milestone. I realized that courage doesn’t mean not being afraid—it means pushing through despite the fear. The discussions around biases made me think about my own assumptions and how easily they can shape my perspective without me even realizing it. It’s a reminder to be more mindful and intentional in my interactions, both personally and professionally
The activities, especially the one about respectful and disrespectful behaviors, made me more aware of how small actions can impact collaboration. For example, it was impressive to see that people at different levels of the organization, including seniors, shared the same mindset. They were actively listening, giving me and other team members space to speak without interrupting or dismissing our input.
Lastly I would say it’s never too late to pick up something you love.

==================================================

We are thrilled to announce the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact non-profit CTO convergence event, hosted by Project Tech4Dev! This event, hosted in Bengaluru on April 5th, brought together over 100 technology leaders representing a diverse set of 58 organizations, including NGOs and tech companies dedicated to serving the social sector.
The event’s agenda was thoughtfully curated to maximize engagement and interaction among participants. It featured a series of short presentations, engaging demo/display booths, a panel discussion with esteemed funders, and facilitated roundtable discussions on pertinent topics such as AI, data governance, DPGs, and collaboration with government entities. Additionally, ample networking opportunities were provided, allowing attendees to forge meaningful connections and lay the groundwork for future collaborations.
It’s very pleasing to note that although the event was organized by Project Tech4Dev, it was predominantly community-driven, with individuals from various organizations actively participating to ensure its success.
We started with an engaging speed networking session run by Bhumika Manjunath of Goalkeep, whose lively facilitation through the day infused the event with energy and positivity. After this, we heard some introductory words from Donald Lobo and Erica Arya of Tech4Dev on the purpose of the event, and the importance of building a tech ecosystem for the social sector .
This was followed by a captivating talk by Aman Dalmia, AI lead at Hyperverge. He talked about the rapidly growing capabilities of LLMs and their application in the non-profit sector.
This was then followed by roundtable discussions, facilitated by esteemed subject matter experts such as Pritam Sukumar (Avanti Fellows), Chethan Elvis Das (SocialBytes Technologies), Aman Dalmia (Hyperverge), Gaurav Godhwani (CivicDataLab), Sanjeev Belagur (Aastrika Foundation), Laxman Joshi (Lend a Hand India), Sumit Arora (Centre for Wildlife Studies), Gaurav Dhingra (Refresh Ideas), Swapneel Rane (Goalkeep), Nivedita krishna (Pacta), Piyali paul (Tech4SocialGood), David Menezes (People+AI), and Nitin Malik (The/Nudge Institute). The roundtable facilitators led dynamic discussions on pertinent topics exploring AI, data governance, DPGs, government collaboration, NGO tech capacity, and product management, fostering engaging and insightful dialogue.
After lunch, we had a change of pace, with a panel discussion on the funding of tech in the profit sector. The panel, moderated by Archana Ramanathan of Dasra, featuring Sahana Jose of Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies, Parveen Sharma of Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and Rohini Kamat, Cisco CSR, shared insightful and nuanced perspectives on effectively setting up and funding tech initiatives within the social sector. This is an oft-overlooked aspect of successful technology set ups in the sector, and this panel discussion provided valuable insight to tech leaders on how to think about funding proposals, and what decision makers on the other side of the table may look at to evaluate these proposals.
The event also showcased demo booth stalls set up by 12 organizations, providing attendees with hands-on experiences and insights into innovative tech solutions driving social impact.
The objective of the event, aligned with one of Project Tech4Dev’s core goals, aimed to establish a network of tech leaders within the social sector and initiate the development of an ecosystem where NGOs and partners could offer mutual advice, support, and, in certain instances, collaborate on ambitious endeavors. Recognizing that this endeavor extends beyond the efforts of a single organization like Project Tech4Dev, it was heartening to witness the enthusiastic participation of numerous individuals in ensuring the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact event.
In conclusion, the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact event underscores the collective commitment and fervor of individuals and organisations striving for meaningful change. As we reflect on this milestone, let us renew our pledge to foster collaboration, ignite creativity, and drive impactful change together. Here’s to the ongoing success and expansion of the Tech4Impact community!

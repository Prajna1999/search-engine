==================================================

This was my
third sprint
at Tech4Dev, but unlike the last two, this one had a slightly new flavour to it —I’m officially no longer a probationer this sprint (yay! 🥳), and just when I thought I could catch my breath… boom 💥 — new beginnings came knocking (in the best way possible).
The Shift That Just
Clicked
🔄
This sprint hit different. I moved from the world of Glific consulting and product (flows, PRDs, stakeholders’ perception/expectations management, webinars, streamlining internal processes —each experience shaping my learning.…) to
Dalgo BizDev
(lead generation, outreach, pre-sales, partnerships, market research, pipeline management, sales strategy, customer discovery, forecasting, demos, relationship building, feedback/follow-ups and much more..)— or how I like to put it, from
flows to forecasts
, from
product to pipeline
📊. What I hadn’t fully realized was how these very experiences were quietly preparing me for areas I feel most energized by—business development, strategy, process-building, and action-oriented execution.💼
The best part? The shift didn’t feel like a big “announcement” or “role change” — it felt like a natural next step, deeply supported and encouraged 💛. There was so much
trust
and
openness
from everyone. And just when I was ready to explore, the opportunity with Dalgo came at the right time — like a door opening the moment I reached it. Couldn’t have asked for a better transition.
Big thanks to the
Glific team
for shaping me (spl. thanks to Krishna, Radhika, Anandu, Aishwarya & Sangeeta), and massive love to the
Dalgo team
(spl. thanks to Ashwin, Abhishek, Siddhant & Himanshu) for taking me in with so much warmth, faith, and space to grow 🙌🌱.
The Sprint — Heartfelt Highlights ✨
💬
Day 1 @ Dalgo
started with a retro, and sure, I was nervous (new team, new domain..). But honestly, the team made it feel like I already belonged. I wasn’t just “joining,” I was being
integrated
— with so many 1:1s, deep convos, direction, and space to pitch in. We wrapped up the week with a solid plan. 🔥
🎯
Anto’s & Deepak’s Strategy Simulation
was a total highlight for me. It was like being in a high-energy zone of ideas, debates, and lightbulb moments 💡. What hit me most was — despite being from different teams, our reflections were surprisingly aligned. That’s the kind of
shared mindset
that keeps the culture here strong 💪.
🤖
Major shoutout to Akansha
for using the Glific chatbot throughout to keep the sprint lively! 💬 It was so refreshing to see tech used like that — quizzes, reminders, nudges — all inside the bot. That’s
real innovation
in how we do even the smallest things 👏.
Where Values Showed Up (Without Saying the Words) 💡
had to reach Mumbai earlier than others due to a personal work, and the team supported my travel without any ifs or buts. No fixed rules like “you can only fly when the sprint starts.” Some team members arrived earlier or stayed longer around the sprint and took leaves for refreshing themselves — and no one was grilled. There’s
trust and maturity
in how personal choices are respected. That freedom is rare, and it says a lot about the culture here. 🙌
🗣️ We had a
dedicated feedback session
during the sprint. What I loved most wasn’t just that we were
allowed
to share, but that the
top leadership genuinely nudged us to
. Here, feedback isn’t a checkbox. It’s a temperature check. And if something’s off — they don’t just say, “We’ll look into it.” They actually do. If a fix isn’t possible, they
tell us the why
. That transparency builds way more than satisfaction — it builds
trust
. This kind of
openness and collaboration
isn’t easy to find, and I don’t take it for granted.
👀 Another reflection —When people get siloed within their departments, it’s easy to lose sight of what others are dealing with. That’s where
cross-team understanding
and
leadership
step in — not just to remind us of our own responsibilities, but to help us see what others are carrying and how deeply interconnected our efforts are. Whether it’s bizdev, product, support, HR/admin, or engineering — everyone has their own load, pressures, and priorities. And the same is true for the NGOs we work with. They’re already stretched thin with program implementation and monitoring, often juggling far more than what’s visible. That’s why it matters when we think ahead for them — when we proactively simplify, support, and make their experience smoother. What struck me is how this same mindset applies within our own teams too. If we can look out for each other with the same care and empathy, real collaboration follows. That’s how we start to truly appreciate one another’s work and build deeper trust across the board. That’s
true collaboration
❤️.
Our sprint happened alongside the
Dasra retreat
, and that gave me a rare chance to reconnect with my batchmates and the team there. During one session, I joined a discussion on a use case — and got to help them think through how tech could be leveraged to address on-ground/program challenges 🧠📱. In return, I got a deeper glimpse into their lived experiences in the field — and that’s the kind of
ecosystem learning
I treasure.
Looking Ahead 👣
This new chapter in
bizdev
feels just right. My previous learnings in product, consulting, research, stakeholder engagement, communication, biasness towards  action — everything now adds up as I build pipelines, think strategy, and align efforts with our larger vision.
Grateful for every single person who made this sprint meaningful, exciting, human, and full of possibilities. You reminded me why this org exists — not just to build tech, but to
build better systems with and for the social sector
🌍.
Let’s keep showing up with curiosity, building with care, and dreaming with boldness 💛💭

==================================================

In August, I jumped into Tech4Dev—a place that blends tech with social impact. From day one, I felt the unique vibe here: small team, big energy, with each person bringing something special. When Radhika asked if anyone wanted to help organize the sprint, I was all in! I’ve always been curious about event management, and stepping into this role felt exciting and a little out of my comfort zone.
Planning the Sprint: Team Spirit at Its Best
Organizing the sprint was such a rewarding experience. From setting up meetings to planning hackathons and team activities, it was all about collaboration and mutual support 🤝. The whole team’s encouragement made me feel like part of the “tribe” from day one, and that sense of shared respect and fun made every moment memorable.
Meeting the Team: Breaking the Ice
Before the sprint, my interactions, like with Himanshu were strictly formal. But meeting in person changed everything! What started as serious chats quickly turned into laughter—especially when we joked about secretly using ChatGPT to polish our responses. It was the same with everyone: those “serious” profiles turned out to be warm, approachable people in person. 😊
Leaders with Heart
❤️
Seeing leaders like Erica, Lobo, and Vinod lead with such openness and humility was amazing. They reminded me of a team of wise mentors, like my own Hogwarts trio—with Erica as McGonagall, Lobo as Dumbledore, and Vinod as Lupin. Their warmth made me feel like part of something special.
Krishna and Radhika: My Support System
Krishna, my manager, has been such a pillar of support, blending structured guidance with informal after-hours chats that made me feel empowered. And Radhika’s open conversations created a comfortable space to share my thoughts and challenges—making me feel truly valued and understood.
Enriching Conversations and Local NGO Connections
The opening circle at Ward’s Lake and the “Ask Me Anything” session with leadership were so enriching. Leaders tackled tough questions with complete transparency, setting a powerful example for all of us 🌱. Connecting with local NGOs was another highlight; they shared their challenges and tech goals openly, reminding me of the impactful mission that drew me to Tech4Dev. It gave me insights into their journeys and a sense of purpose in the work we do.
The Sprint: Work, Laughter, and Connection
The sprint wasn’t just about work; it was a mix of laughter, friendly teasing, and bonding over shared experiences. My colleagues, especially Akhilesh, even gave me some good-natured ribbing 😆. Between work sessions, team dinners, and exploring the city, every part of the schedule was balanced perfectly. The food and accommodation were top-notch, thanks to Diana, Amit, Aishwarya, and everyone else involved.
Hackathon Highlights and New Bonds
During the hackathon, I was placed with the Dalgo team, where Shamoon and Ishan made me feel right at home. Though initially unsure about my contributions, their warmth and openness quickly put me at ease, valuing my input and creating a true sense of belonging. Our team even snagged second place! Throughout the week, we had enriching conversations that covered everything from politics and religion to personal journeys and the nuances of married life. My roommate, Abhishek, was incredibly thoughtful, and late-night and early-morning chats with everyone—Anto, Thomas, Gautam, Anandu, Krishna, Radhika, Sangeeta, Aishwarya, Amisha, Tejas, and Akansha—made the experience even more memorable.
Personal Goals and Realizations
One thing that struck me was everyone’s fitness level. I joked that I might need a ropeway on the next hike if I don’t shape up! Inspired, I made a few bets with teammates to work on my fitness 😅—gotta start somewhere, right?
Exploring Local Culture and Beyond
From market visits to late-night drinks, it was a whirlwind of fun and learning about the local culture. Conversations about certain projects, Dalgo and the Fractional CXO Program seamlessly flowed from work discussions to casual chats over coffee, dinner, and even late-night drinks, and exploring new ideas for projects. Despite the packed schedule, I felt refreshed, whether shopping, singing on bus rides, or stopping for photos. The closing night, filled with dancing and joy, was the perfect ending to an unforgettable week 💃🕺.

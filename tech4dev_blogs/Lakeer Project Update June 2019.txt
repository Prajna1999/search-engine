==================================================

The
past three months have been immensely productive for us at
Lakeer
.
Thanks to Soft Corner for developing with us our products, and
to
Tech4Dev
for
the immense support and frequent follow-ups. Here?s a quick update
on what we have been up to:
Product
1- QGIS plug-in for CitySight:
Soft
	CornerÂ has
	closely worked with us and developed a QGIS plug-in for us which is
	currently connected to our CitySight?s staging database and loads
	all the layers on the platform on to QGIS. The user of the plugin,
	with authorized credentials, can connect to CitySight?s database
	and look at all the available datasets on the CitySight?s
	platform, select the desired layers and load them on QGIS. This
	enables users to utilize QGIS? functionalities in CitySight.
Amar
	and team are working on the second part of the plug-in which will
	allow the user to not just download layers from the database, but
	also push analyses results from QGIS to the CitySight platform and
	also specify the category and service (the hierarchical location of
	the dataset) for such dataset while doing so. This plugin will help
	us reduce the high costs of uploading individual datasets on to the
	server.
Product
2- City-Reporter:
Soft
	Corner and Lakeer have built the first version of our City-Reporter
	tool. The tool helps to report data stories for urban issues like
	public transport, housing, climate change, etc. City-reporter so far
	can:
Help
	build basic data stories on urban issues. Each story built on the
	platform will consist of multiple sections in the form of text,
	interactive map, media, embedded content, or a combination of any
	two of these.
CityReporter
	allows users to pull specific analyses made on CitySight to augment
	the data stories they are building. This helps tell a story
	spatially across the city.
The
	stories created can be shared on social media platforms of LinkedIn,
	Facebook, and Twitter. This helps readers to share the stories with
	the larger citizenry.
The
	platform also allows a comments section at the end of each story,
	the comments in which can be later approved by the admin.
We
	had a user training session with Soft-Corner where they trained our
	team on working with all the features of the reporting tool.
The
	reporter tool has been deployed on the server and we are working on
	building more test stories on the platform.
Pradnya
and the entire Soft Corner team have been immensely supportive
throughout the development process and have closely interacted with
us and made this progress possible.
This
week is very crucial for us as Soft Corner would be handing us over
the city-reporter tool. We are still working on some minor changes
and testing all the features.

==================================================

The primary aim of the CRM platform project is to provide a ready to use development platform for the software partners for the CRMâ€™ish projects. We are hoping it will save considerable time and effort involved in research and bootstrapping the project.
Overview
Currently, we have implemented a backend for this platform. Below are the details of the functionalities which have been implemented for this project:
Define and manage a set of contact types and details
Activity Management
User Management
Access control and Roles
Geographic data for the world (countries, states), with a focus on India initially (States, Districts, Blocks, Villages)
Easy to extend all in-built objects as per NGO needs
Strong API suite that can be used to implement cross-platform applications
CRM Platform is implemented as a Strapi Local plugin, so tightly coupled with
Strapi
platform.
We have used
Mochajs
for building API test suite.
The API documentation is generated using
slate
project and it is published on GitHub pages.

We are also using
CircleCI

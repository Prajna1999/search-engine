==================================================

Tech solutions often fail NGOs. Why? Because most tech companies design solutions remotely, without understanding on-ground realities. In a conversation with Antony Vivek, an entrepreneur-turned-social-impact-leader, we explore how fCxO is bridging this gap. Antony Vivek shares how fCxO bridges the gap between NGOs and effective tech adoption‚Äîhelping organizations move from chaos to structured solutions. He dives into real-world case studies, from education in Rajasthan to tribal healthcare AI projects.
Deepak:
Antony, thanks for joining us today! Let‚Äôs start with your journey. What were you doing before joining the fCxO program at Project Tech4Dev, and how did you end up here?
Antony:
I‚Äôve always had an entrepreneurial mindset. Straight out of college, I started my own firm‚Äî17 years ago now! Back then, we noticed that while India had a massive IT workforce, most products were being developed for companies in other countries. This idea stuck with me, and I wanted to build an
India-first tech product
that could later scale globally.
Through my career, I worked mostly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, helping businesses navigate
chaotic, unstructured environments
and bringing
order to the madness
. Over time, I got deeply involved in the social impact space‚Äîpartly because my wife works in the sector. I was always supporting her work from the sidelines.
When COVID hit, I saw it as a turning point. I moved into impact consulting, where I realized a
huge gap
‚Äîconsulting firms were advising NGOs on the need for tech, but
not actually helping them implement it
. Many organizations simply didn‚Äôt have the resources or expertise to execute these strategies.
That‚Äôs when I came across
Project Tech4Dev‚Äôs Fractional CxO (fCxO) Program
‚Äîoffering
part-time, senior tech leadership for NGOs
. It was exactly the
hands-on, problem-solving approach
I believed in. So, I joined the program, and the rest is history!
Deepak:
That‚Äôs an incredible journey. Given your experience working with startups, how do you compare the challenges faced by
NGOs
versus
corporate businesses
?
Antony:
In many ways, NGOs have it
tougher than startups
. They operate with:
Limited budgets
Small teams
Tight timelines
Huge expectations to create impact at scale
Another similarity is how
NGOs and startups both reverse-engineer solutions
. In the corporate world, products are often built for
top-tier cities first
and then adapted for smaller towns. But NGOs take the
opposite
approach‚Äî
designing frugal, scalable solutions
for underserved communities and then
scaling them up
.
A key challenge is
bringing structure to the chaos
. NGOs are juggling
donor expectations, community needs, and internal operations
, all while trying to drive impact. That‚Äôs where a
tech intervention
‚Äîeven something as simple as
automating processes
‚Äîcan make a huge difference.
Deepak:
Can you share an example of an NGO you‚Äôve worked with and how tech helped them?
Antony:
Absolutely. One experience that stuck with me was working with an NGO in Rajasthan focused on
getting out-of-school girls back into education
.
From a consulting perspective, we initially thought:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The best way to support them was through
volunteer teachers
2Ô∏è‚É£ These volunteers should have
a B.Ed degree
(education qualification)
But when I visited the field, I met
a local community leader‚Äîa physically challenged man‚Äîwho was the real changemaker
. He was personally convincing families to send their daughters to school,
organizing transport, negotiating with families, and ensuring safety
.
I realized that
our assumption about needing B.Ed-qualified teachers was flawed
. The real challenge was
mobilizing local community leaders
‚Äînot finding formally trained educators. We pivoted the strategy to
recruit passionate volunteers rather than just focusing on credentials
. This drastically
expanded the talent pool
and
boosted program impact
.
The key takeaway?
You need to be on the ground to truly understand problems before implementing tech solutions.
Deepak:
That‚Äôs a powerful insight. Now, you‚Äôre working with
SEARCH
, an NGO focused on
tribal healthcare
. What has your experience been like?
Antony:
SEARCH operates in deeply
rural, tribal areas
with very
limited access to healthcare
. They wanted to explore
AI for mental health support
‚Äîbut they were still using
archaic software from the early 2000s!
Their challenge was
jumping from outdated tech straight to AI
without the
right infrastructure
in place. As an fCxO, my role was to
help them take a more structured approach
.
One of our quick wins was implementing
Glific
, a WhatsApp-based chatbot solution. Within
five days
, we had a functional chatbot supporting their mental health initiative. They were blown away‚Äîit showed them that
tech is accessible and scalable when approached strategically
.
This experience reaffirmed what I believe:
‚úÖ NGOs need
structured guidance
in selecting and implementing the right tech
‚úÖ They need to focus on
real challenges
, not just chase trends like AI
‚úÖ
Hands-on, field-driven tech adoption
is what truly works
Deepak:
That‚Äôs amazing. Unlike traditional consultants,
fCxOs work closely with NGOs over months
. How does this model make a difference?
Antony:
Consultants often work in
short bursts
‚Äîthey analyze, create reports, and move on. But NGOs need
sustained support
to navigate the
messiness of tech adoption
.
I see
fCxOs as a guiding force
‚Äîlike a
parent
helping a child in a candy store. NGOs often
get excited about every tech solution
but need someone to help them
prioritize what‚Äôs actually useful
. We don‚Äôt just
recommend
solutions‚Äîwe
implement them alongside the team
.
This hands-on approach is what makes fCxO different. It‚Äôs about:
1Ô∏è‚É£
Helping NGOs define their real tech needs
2Ô∏è‚É£
Guiding them through implementation‚Äîstep by step
3Ô∏è‚É£
Ensuring long-term sustainability, even after we leave
Deepak:
What‚Äôs next for fCxO? How do you see the program evolving?
Antony:
There‚Äôs
huge potential
to scale the
fCxO model
across more NGOs. Right now, many NGOs:
üîπ Know they need
tech support
but don‚Äôt know
where to start
üîπ Struggle with
finding the right vendors and tools
üîπ Need help in
defining their tech roadmap
At the recent
fCxO Sprint
, we worked with an NGO facing
major data challenges
. In just
a week
, we built a structured approach that
transformed how they manage data
.
The future of fCxO is:
‚úÖ
Expanding access
to more NGOs
‚úÖ
Building a network of tech leaders
passionate about social impact
‚úÖ
Creating a lasting impact by embedding tech into nonprofit operations
I personally hope to
work with 10+ NGOs in my lifetime
‚Äîbecause every NGO we empower
amplifies impact for thousands of beneficiaries
.
Deepak:
That‚Äôs inspiring. It‚Äôs clear that your journey‚Äîfrom tech entrepreneur to social impact leader‚Äîhas reshaped your
definition of success
.
Antony:
Absolutely. Earlier, success was about
scaling businesses
. Now, it‚Äôs about
scaling impact
.
At
SEARCH
, I saw a powerful example of this:
üí° Twice a week, the entire team‚Äîfrom leadership to field staff‚Äîcleans the campus together at 6 AM. No one is
forced
to do it‚Äîit‚Äôs about
shared ownership and responsibility
.
That‚Äôs what I want to bring into my work‚Äî
helping NGOs build sustainable, tech-enabled ecosystems
that
outlast individual contributions
.
Deepak:
That‚Äôs a beautiful perspective. Thank you, Antony, for sharing your journey and insights. Looking forward to seeing fCxO grow and transform more NGOs!
Antony:
Thanks, Deepak! It‚Äôs been great reflecting on this journey and what lies ahead.

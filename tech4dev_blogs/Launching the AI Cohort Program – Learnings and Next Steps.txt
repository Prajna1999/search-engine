==================================================

Last month, we launched the pilot edition of the
AI Cohort Program
‚Äîa joint initiative between Project Tech4Dev and The Agency Fund. This program is our attempt to meaningfully support the development sector in designing and building responsible AI solutions, while actively learning from the process ourselves.
We are especially excited about this initiative because we at Project Tech4Dev are also building an open-source AI platform tailored for social impact. The ideas, patterns, and solutions emerging from this program will generate valuable insights for shaping the AI platform.
Ecosystem Response
We received applications from 27 NGOs across education, health, livelihoods, gender, and governance. What stood out wasn‚Äôt just the number‚Äîit was the depth of interest, intent to experiment, and shared belief that AI can be a game-changer in the development sector.
We also witnessed a growing community of thought partners, mentors, and collaborators. People from diverse backgrounds stepped up generously to support this effort.
How is the development sector embracing AI so far?
A key learning through this process is that many NGOs are aware of AI‚Äôs potential, but lack hands-on experience or capacity to explore it meaningfully. The need is clear: dedicated hand-holding, mentoring and practical exposure.
One applicant captured this perfectly when they said:
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where to start. It feels like an ocean, and we‚Äôre just trying to find our footing.‚Äù
Some common challenges that emerged:
Funding gaps for tech experimentation
Limited in-house tech capacity, especially for AI/ML
Lack of structured, accessible entry points to explore or prototype AI ideas
This pilot cohort is our way of bridging this gap‚Äîby offering hands-on support while learning what it actually takes to make AI adoption real, contextual, and sustainable in the sector.
Our Evaluation Framework: Designed for Ecosystem-Wide Learning
We focused on selecting use cases that are representative, replicable, and ecosystem-relevant.
Here‚Äôs the simplified version of our evaluation rubric:
Criteria
Description
Weight
Bandwidth
At least one person with 40‚Äì50% availability and basic tech comfort
60%
AI maturity
Some prior experimentation or pilot
20%
Leadership buy-in
Comfort with investing in tech (~‚Çπ10L) and strong leadership support
5%
Ecosystem relevance
Use case should benefit more than one org / be a reusable pattern
5%
Impact
Scale, depth, and potential of the solution
5%
Sustainability
Likelihood of continuing post-program (qualitative)
5%
We eventually selected 7 NGOs to be part of this pilot cohort‚Äîeach working on a unique problem that, if solved well, could inform broader AI use across the sector.
Selected NGOs & Use Cases
Here‚Äôs a quick look at the organizations and the AI solutions they‚Äôre building:
Name of NGO
Use Case
SNEHA
A conversational health chatbot for pregnant women that also surfaces hidden indicators of gender-based violence. Combines behavior insights with machine learning.
IPE Global
Uses AI to integrate public health data (HMIS, ICDS, surveys) to identify malnutrition hotspots and enable targeted interventions.
Quest Alliance
A ‚ÄúGoogle Maps for Careers‚Äù‚Äîan AI-powered guidance system for young people navigating skills, jobs, and learning pathways.
Simple Education Foundation
Assessing teacher growth using qualitative, reflective inputs‚Äîinterpreted via NLP models.
Avanti Fellows
AI-generated reports and a self-learning chatbot to provide personalized feedback to online students.
Inqui-lab Foundation
Evaluating creative student responses like drawings and open-ended answers using image processing and NLP.
Samanvay Foundation
Enhancing the open-source Avni platform with AI capabilities to make it cheaper, smarter, and easier to use.
üöÄ What‚Äôs Next
We‚Äôre officially kicking off the cohort with our first virtual meeting in the third week of July. From there:
Each NGO will be matched with dedicated mentors
Prototyping will begin, with a goal of launching a working, testable version in a few months
We‚Äôll run open sessions on AI tools, responsible design, ethics, and evaluation (and share these on YouTube so the wider ecosystem can learn alongside us)
We see this program not just as a pilot, but as a proof-of-concept for how AI support in the development sector can be done differently‚Äîgrounded in collaboration, openness, and experimentation.
We‚Äôll also be recording most of our sessions and sharing them on
YouTube
so others in the ecosystem can learn alongside us.
We‚Äôre excited and looking forward to launching the program and diving into the solution-building phase with our cohort!

Well, itâ€™s not even a week since v0.1 release, however, we have made good progress on the frontend and added quite a few improvements. Here are some of the updates:
New UI for Tags Listing
Keyword support for tags
along with UI refresh
Better confirmation dialogs

We are super excited about v0.2 and a lot of exciting stuff planned for the same. Our focus for the next week or so will be on the following:
Finishing login/registration/authentication

Managing HSM templates
Message sending interface to support basic formatting
Improving test and code coverage

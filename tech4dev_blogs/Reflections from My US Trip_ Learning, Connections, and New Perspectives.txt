==================================================

This September, I went on a two-week trip to the US, filled with excitement and anticipation. I was heading to two big events: a funder dinner in San Francisco (SF) and the Dasra Philanthropy Forum in New York (NY). Both were firsts for me, so naturally, I had a lot running through my mind—
What would it be like? Who would I meet? How would things turn out?
It was a mix of anticipation and curiosity, which made it all the more interesting.
The Funder Dinner in San Francisco: New Beginnings:
My first stop was SF for the funder dinner where four NGOs leaders — Vanessa from
SNEHA Mumbai
, Sucheta from
Dream-A-Dream
, Supriya from
Rebuild India Fund
, and myself from
Project Tech4Dev
—were presenting our work to a room full of funders, friends, and well-wishers. The prep for the event started over a month before, and I was amazed at the level of detail that went into it during our weekly connects: the venue, the timing of presentations, how the meal courses would line up with the talks, the invite designs, and of course, getting those all-important RSVPs. Huge shoutout to the Dasra team for pulling it all together!
As the event got closer, my excitement grew, but also some nervousness crept in. Thankfully, the night before the big day, our hosts, Lobo and Marie, invited the NGO leaders and a few neighbors (who also happened to be funders) over for dinner. That casual get-together was the perfect icebreaker, the warmth of their hospitality was a big takeaway for me which made everything else look and feel so comfortable.
Impact in Five Minutes:
Finally, the evening of the event arrived. We welcomed our guests, and soon, the room was buzzing with conversations. It was a full house, and I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for everyone who had chosen to spend their Saturday evening with us. People were reconnecting with old friends, forming new connections, and sharing, in the excitement of the evening.
The format of the event was brilliant: four five-minute NGO pitches, each followed by a short Q&A. This format was just enough to spark curiosity without overwhelming the audience. It was amazing to see the level of engagement, especially given that many attendees lived far from India but were still deeply connected to the cause. I was personally moved and shaken by the powerful stories shared by Hechin Haokip from the Center for Women and Girls and Manohari Doss from the Institute of Self Management – both NGOs supported by the Rebuild India Fund. Some guests were new to the social impact sector, and I could see this event opening doors for them to become champions of these causes in times to come.
The atmosphere in the room felt right—structured but not rigid, formal yet relaxed. The intimate gathering of about 65 people struck a balance that allowed for meaningful discussions while ensuring everyone had space to connect. As the event progressed, the room was filled with energy, and I walked away feeling that the evening was a big success. Hope everyone found a few others they connected to continue the conversations. I know I found two whom I will be following up with:)
The event’s format was so interesting, and I really hope we do more gatherings like this in the future—it felt meaningful and impactful.
New York and the UNGA: An Overwhelming First Glimpse:
After SF, I flew to New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) week, which was a bit overwhelming as a first-timer. I had heard a lot about it —how people hustle to get into side events and register for them ahead of time. It’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re new to the scene.
One event that I managed to attend was a panel discussion hosted by IDInsight on “Making Respect Real in Development.” The discussion was powerful, with leaders like Anshu Gupta of Goonj, Rakesh Rajani of JustSystems, and Cate Oswald of Partners in Health sharing their thoughts. They talked about how disrespecting someone’s dignity can deeply impact their well-being, but when you get it right, it can unlock incredible potential. It was a thought-provoking conversation that left me reflecting on how we can all make a difference, no matter how small our circle of influence.
Dasra Philanthropy Forum: 10 Years of Impact:
The final highlight of my trip was the Dasra Philanthropy Forum (DPF), held during UNGA week, celebrating its 10-year milestone. Dasra, once again, organized a brilliant event filled with curated panel discussions, fireside chats, and roundtables that brought together leaders and change-makers working on India’s toughest challenges. It was a huge gathering, offering a wealth of global perspectives. For me, it was a chance to meet new people, share what we’re doing at Project Tech4Dev, and listen to diverse perspectives from around the world.
Takeaways and Reflections:
Looking back on my two weeks in the US, I feel like I learned so much—both about the social impact space and about myself. The funder dinner taught me the value of short, powerful pitches and how even a five-minute talk can spark meaningful conversations. The UNGA side event reminded me of the importance of dignity in development work, something that’s easy to overlook but critical to long-term success. And the Dasra Philanthropy Forum showed me the power of collaboration and the global commitment to driving change.
All in all, it was a fulfilling trip, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit—hopefully with a bit more planning and a lot more in control!

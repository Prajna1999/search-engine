==================================================

The Dasra Philanthropy Week (DPW) was held in the week of
the 24
th
Feb, with a breakout session for Tech4Dev on 29
th
Feb. DPW is an annual convening of non-profit leaders, philanthropists,
foundations, policymakers and other key stakeholders to discuss the way forward
for India?s development. In addition to the plenary sessions, there were
multiple breakout sessions.
The session on Tech4Dev was for highlighting the value that
technology brings to the social impact space, discussing how it allows
non-profits to improve efficiency in their operations and listen to their
beneficiaries better, and enhance the overall impact on the sector. The session
comprised a 30 min panel discussion followed by forty-five minutes of software
solution demos to an audience of around forty people. The audience was a mix of
philanthropists and funders, NGOs, and software providers.
The panel discussion was moderated by Prapti Patel from
Dasra and comprised Insiyah Rangwala from Antarang Foundation, Arun Kadekodi
from Soft-Corner and me, from Lumen Consulting. The panel discussion revolved
around the origins of Tech4Dev, the problems it is aiming to solve, experience
of NGOs and software partners working with each other, and the challenges of
scaling up such a platform going forward.
The demos had a format similar to speed-dating with staff
from four organizations ? Samanvay Foundation, Noora Health, Indus Action, and
Antarang Foundation – manning a desk each and a cluster of 8-10 people
interacting with each organization for 10 minutes before moving on to the next
desk.
Vivek and Arjun from Samanvay Foundation talked
about their open source field
service and data collection platform ? Avni
Arjun Rangarajan from Noora Health talked of using Whatsapp for
training patients and their families with high-impact health skills to improve
outcomes
Mahua Bisht and Tarun Cherukuri from Indus Action demoed
their technology solution for ensuring implementation of the Right to Education
provisions across schools in India
Insiyah Rangwala from Antarang Foundation shared insights on
using technology for their CareerAware and CareeReady programs.
The response to both the panel discussion and the demos was
positive, as evidenced by the conversations happening after the demos between
the members of the audience and the panellists as well as the demo staff.
Some of the interesting questions I got during my
conversations:
1. How can we use Tech4Dev open source platforms for
technology in agriculture?
2. What does Tech4Dev think of a SAAS subscription model?
3. Why don?t you (ie. Tech4Dev) think of creating scrips for
leveraging the existing capabilities of Google Docs, Tableau, Power BI, etc and
upload these scrips for free use?
Some feedback on the session from others:
1. There could have been more time allocated to the session
with some time left for Q&A after the pane discussion as well as the demos
2. Most people could visit only three demos and not all
four, so maybe we could have allocated more time for the demos. (However, the
time allocated was by design for keeping the demos to a short elevator pitch
style format.)
3. A little more structured networking would have helped.

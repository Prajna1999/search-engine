Play centers are created as an organization
Request for toys by creating sales quotations for an organization
Toys are assigned as an order against a particular organization
Program officers/ Admin staff can create quotation and once approved by Inventory manager it is recorded against the organization
Program officer can scrap the products in a particular order
Current Roadblocks
The system is not very user-friendly

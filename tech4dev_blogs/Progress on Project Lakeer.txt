==================================================

After our initial engagement with Lakeer, at their office in Hyderabad, we identified that there were 2 areas needing technology support, which could bring in a significant change in their day to day work.
1. QGIS
One
of the 2 areas is, once the Lakeer team has the curated geotagged
json with them, loading it to QGIS for doing further analysis, by
every team member, takes a long time. A lot of time is spent by every
team member, waiting, before they can start actual work on QGIS.
Second issue of this approach is keeping the data in sync with the
website. Here, the team has to create geo json through QGIS and wait
till the developer migrates the file to the database.
Solution
The
solution we came up here was building a QGIS plugin – that would go
into the QGIS desktop application of every team member. The plugin is
a 2-way channel, where data once loaded through JSON file, can be
saved to a central database by a team member playing the admin role.
The QGIS application on each team member?s desktop, directly loads
the json, from the central database.
This
solution brings in two improvements, namely, the load time is reduced
and it also gets rid of data duplication.

2. Web Reporting?
The
second important aspect of Lakeer’s work is displaying the impact of
their work to common citizens. Lakeer already has an intranet site
called “CitySight”. This is a web based, open source,
geospatial tool. CitySight helps the urban administrators to measure
and improve city health.
But
the reach of CitySight is limited to mostly the city office
bureaucrats or Lakeer team themselves. Also the geospatial tools
built in CitySight, provide more of analysis, which probably a layman
may not understand. To circumvent this, Lakeer was looking for a web
based Reporting solution, which could reach masses easily. The idea
was to share the success stories of Lakeer’s work with the people
from the city.
After
talking to the founder, Dipika, we realized that she was looking for
a web-based reporting where she / her team could manage not just the
content but also the content layout on the fly – based on the data
available for that issue, at that point of time.
For
example the reporting tool could have the ability to show an issue
reported with before and after photos, to bring forth the impact. Or
it may have analysis charts, graphs or may be heat maps overlaid on a
map. Over and above, she is also looking forward to have some textual
content, highlighting the key points, on the same site. We built an
early prototype, that had thumbnails of news articles, twitter handle
etc. with links to appropriate pages. This idea was approved by the
Lakeer team. Besides this, Deepika also suggested of having a way for
citizens to comment on each success story.
Solution
and Technology stack used
Considering
the kind of flexibility that Deepika and her team were looking for in
the reporting tool, we decided to go ahead with WordPress to build a
single page web based application for her needs.
A
couple of WordPress plugins that we used here are?
Simple
	custom JS and CS
Simple
	custom CSS
Post
	Grid
Advanced
	Custom Fields
In the coming few weeks we plan to test and deploy these changes on to the Lakeer server, for the Lakeer team to start using it and share their feedback with us.

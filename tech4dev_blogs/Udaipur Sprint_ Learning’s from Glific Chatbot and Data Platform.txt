==================================================

The Udaipur Sprint organized by Tech4Dev for Glific training and Data Platform for NGOs proved to be an exciting and enriching experience, opening up new possibilities for SNEHA organizations. Inspired by the knowledge and connections gained during the event, our organization is now eager to pilot a small project in the Mumbai Bhiwandi area, specifically focusing on the child immunization module using Glific Chatbot. By integrating the Glific Chatbot into our child immunization module, we aim to streamline and improve the vaccination process for children in the Mumbai Bhiwandi area. The chatbot’s capabilities will enable us to automate reminders, provide information on immunization schedules, and address common queries from parents. This approach has the potential to enhance communication, increase immunization rates, and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for children.The Udaipur Sprint provided valuable insights into the functionalities and integration possibilities of Glific Chatbot, making it the ideal choice for our pilot project.
My journey began when Mr. Vinod connected me with the Tech4Dev and Glific teams, enabling me to dive deeper into the world of chatbots and data platforms. Their guidance and support were instrumental in helping me gain hands-on experience and understanding of these technologies.
Mohit played a crucial role in assisting me with creating a Facebook business account, which had been a struggle for me initially. His expertise and patience helped me overcome the challenges, and I was able to set up the account successfully.
Krishna Priya, another valuable member of the team, oriented me on Glific and its various functions. Her insights and explanations provided a solid foundation for me to explore the platform’s capabilities further.
Akhilesh, a knowledgeable individual, extended his assistance in creating my first chatbot workflow. With his help and the integration of Google Sheets, I was able to gather valuable data seamlessly. Within a day, I successfully created the chatbot workflow and tested it on WhatsApp, marking a significant milestone in my learning journey.
One of the highlights of the Udaipur Sprint was the discovery of Glific’s integration with ChatGPT. This integration opened up a world of possibilities, combining the power of chatbots with advanced language processing capabilities.
Having used a Business Intelligence (BI) system for the past four years, our organization recognizes the importance of staying updated with the latest data platforms. With the rapid advancements in technology and the potential offered by Tech4Dev Data Platform, we believe it is an opportune time to upgrade our system. Furthermore, meeting Siddhant in person after our previous online connection regarding the Data Platform was an enriching experience. Not only was he incredibly knowledgeable about the platform, but he also proved to be a very down-to-earth personality. Working closely with him provided an ideal platform for insightful discussions and extensive knowledge sharing on the intricacies of the platform.

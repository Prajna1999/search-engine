This blog is written by Nidhi Thomas from
Involve Learning Solutions Foundation
At Involve, we were one of the most nascent organisations at the sprint…. but that helped us to our advantage as we adsorbed and reflected on everyone’s amazing experiences. We heard inspirational journeys of experienced organisations – how they navigated their
problem space, how they designed (and redesigned solutions at times) and they were also so very candid about sharing stories of when things didn’t work as they had anticipated. We have taken this plethora of learnings and are in the process of analysing it to build our
solution (we are aware that our planned solution is ambitious but interacting with the folks at the sprint gave us hope and confidence that we were on the right track).
Though we had some amazing thought-provoking sessions, the 2 that stood out to me were the Intervention Design session by James Walsh and the User Experience for Engagement by Yuxi Liu. James’s session led us into a thought-provoking journey of how important it was to have institutional transparency, trust as well as making informed collective unbiased decisions that benefit the entire organisation. Yuxi’s session, on the other hand, taught us the elements that we need to focus on to engage our users. On behalf of a lot of others in
the room, I can confidently say that we realised some were actually obvious skills, which we often tend to overlook.
And how can I end without describing the amazing time that we all had and the amazing, warm people that we got a chance to interact with. It indeed felt like a family get together where we were having lots of fun and learning a lot from each other’s experiences. I have
made so many friends and I know that I can reach out to them when I need their help or even when I feel like having a fun chat with them.
Thank you

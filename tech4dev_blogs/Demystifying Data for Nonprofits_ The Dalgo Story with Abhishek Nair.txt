==================================================

In a detailed conversation, Abhishek Nair, sits down with Deepak Nanda to unpack the Dalgo’s origins, evolution, and growing impact across India’s nonprofit ecosystem.
What Is Dalgo?
Dalgo is a data platform built specifically for nonprofits. Its core purpose is to automate data flows, making it easier for organizations to generate insights and spend less time on repetitive data management tasks.
“Dalgo helps nonprofits automate the flow of data so they can spend more time learning from that data — and less time managing it.”
Why Dalgo: From a Challenge to a Platform
The idea for Dalgo emerged from Project Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO (fCxO) program. As fCxOs worked across nonprofits, a pattern emerged: NGOs used multiple tools — survey software, Google Sheets, chatbots — but data remained siloed and difficult to consolidate.
“NGOs were stringing together data in fragile ways or spending weeks every quarter just to get a complete picture. We wanted to fix that.”
This insight led to Dalgo’s mission: help nonprofits get a holistic, real-time view of their work and impact across tools, locations, and programs.
The Problem: Data Silos and Underused Insights
Two common realities shaped Dalgo’s design:
Data is mostly used for reporting to funders, not internal reflection or learning.
Teams are stretched thin — they collect a lot of data but often lack time or capacity to analyze or use it effectively and regularly.
Dalgo aims to bridge this gap: unify data from different sources, clean and structure it, and make it regularly accessible to all levels of a nonprofit — from field workers to leadership.
Case in Point: How SNEHA NGO Uses Dalgo
SNEHA, a health-focused nonprofit, is a great example of Dalgo in action.
Multiple Programs: They collect data from different programs using both survey tools and spreadsheets.
Automated Dashboards: Dalgo helped them unify data pipelines and create dashboards for field workers, M&E teams, and leadership.
Faster Access: Teams that once got monthly reports now access refreshed data daily.
Scalable Adoption: Started with one program, now expanding across three — and counting.
“Earlier the M&E team had to spend hours consolidating data. Now, field workers get insights daily and take action in real time.”
Making Data Simpler — for Everyone
One of Dalgo’s key goals is accessibility. Social sector teams often find data and tech tools overwhelming. Dalgo reduces this friction by:
Offering ready-to-use connectors to 300+ data sources.
Supporting both quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., text analysis using AI).
Giving NGOs the option to use their preferred visualization tools (like Google Data Studio or Superset).
Designing for non-engineers, including program and M&E teams.
“Our vision is to make data usable for everyone — not just M&E heads. We’re exploring how AI advancements might help with this too”
What’s Next for Dalgo
Dalgo is continuously evolving, with new directions focused on:
1. Chat With Your Data (AI-Driven Insight Generation)
Ask natural-language questions.
Get summaries, trends, and program insights instantly.
2. Storytelling with Data
Auto-generate quarterly reports for stakeholders.
Make dashboards more interactive and integrated into day-to-day conversations.
3. Impact Sector-Specific Design
Key indicator template dashboards and reports for health, education, or livelihoods.
Focus on impact, reach, implementation, fundraising, etc
Mee the sector where it is in terms of key users and their needs, skills and preferences
4. Community Learning
More conversations with nonprofits.
Open channels for co-creating features based on real needs.
“We don’t think we know everything. The nonprofits are the experts — our job is to learn from them and build tools that truly help.”
So, Who Should Use Dalgo?
Dalgo is ideal for nonprofits that are:
Already collecting significant data digitally
Want to move from data entry → insight → decision-making
Are ready to invest in better data systems to scale impact
“If you’re asking — ‘Am I using data as effectively as I want to?’ — and the answer is no, it’s time to explore Dalgo.”
Dalgo isn’t just a platform. It’s a movement toward democratizing data use in the nonprofit world — with scalable systems, affordable access, and built-in support.

==================================================

Testing is an important part of creating any application. It gives you the confidence that your application works the way it is meant to. At
Glific
, we use a react testing library and cypress for manual and end to end testing, to ensure that we create the highest quality code and minimize issues. Today, I will be talking about an end to end testing using
Cypress
.
What is Cypress?
Cypress is the future web-based front-end testing platform. It aims to solve the obstacles that developers face when testing React and AngularJS-based web applications. Itâ€™s a fast, effortless, and reliable tool to test any application running on a browser.
You can read more about Cypress on their website

.
For Glific, we have created a separate repository to manage all test cases and run it using GitHub CI
here
.

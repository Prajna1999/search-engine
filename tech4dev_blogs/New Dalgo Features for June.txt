==================================================

Team Dalgo has been hard at work and have a cornucopia of features to release this month. In addition to this post we’re going to have a webinar on June 28th introducing all of them.
Data Statistics
Point it at a table in your warehouse and get column-level statistics:
Every row in the screenshot above corresponds to a column in the table “worldometer_data”. The column names are on the left i.e. “NewCases”, “Continent”, “NewDeaths” etc. Then we show the column’s data type followed by
Number of distinct values in that column
Number of records with a NULL value in that column
A value distribution of the top 5
And for numeric columns, the Minimum, Maximum, Mean, Median, and Mode
This is being made available within the
graphical workflow designer
for transformations. It is meant to give you a quick view into the
nature
of a table; either a table which you want to start working from or a table which you have created and which you would now like to check.
Data Quality Dashboards
We have integrated
Elementary
into our dbt pipelines. Elementary tracks your dbt tests and generates a beautiful report for you:
You can view tests by model:
And when tests fail, Elementary helps you find out what went wrong:
In this first release we’re providing only this reporting interface; the tests themselves still need to be
written in dbt
and checked into your GitHub repository.
Source Schema Change Detection and Handling
Suppose you have a data source which Dalgo syncs to your warehouse, and now suppose that source changes. Maybe a table was added, maybe a column was removed. Airbyte, which we run under the hood,
has a way
to detect this and let the user know. We are now exposing this feature of Airbyte to you through the Dalgo UI:
When you see this notification, you would either
accept these changes and thereby update your pipeline,
or realize that the changes were wrong and go fix the source.
Custom Tasks for dbt
Finally, we’ve added the ability to create “custom dbt tasks”. The dbt tasks like “run” and “test” which are available by default will run your entire workflow. But dbt lets you run
only one model
if you want to, or a particular set of models. We’ve made this functionality available by allowing you to define a
custom dbt task
:
You can then save these custom tasks and use them in your pipelines:
In Summary
We hope you find these new features useful, and as always we look forward to your feedback. Don’t miss Shamoon’s webinar on the 28th!

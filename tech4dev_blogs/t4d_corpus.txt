==================================================

Background
During the November tech4dev face to face meetup,
Persistent
team participated in a day-long workshop of Avni. After the workshop, they decided to contribute to
Avni
and begin with the following
Development of Online Web-based data entry app for Avni
Help with improving Visual Designs of other parts of the product
The following was agreed
To start with, the following skills and number of people were identified. Persistent will start identifying people from their pool for these and form a team in Pune
– Java ? 2 ? For Api development –
– React.js ? 3 ? For frontend development
– Visual Designer ? 1 ? For screen design
VD of screens is the first task that needs to start asap
Training on tech stack and product to be provided by Samanvay team as soon as the development team is formed
Total duration not to exceed 4- 5 calendar months from the start date of the project
Development to happen in a joint ownership model between Persistent and Samanvay Avni teams
Being local in Pune, Soft corner Avni team to pitch in to help as and when required.
Scope, Epics and Stories
This
epic here
describes the scope of the online web-based data entry app.
Active Engagement
Active engagement between Persistent and Avni began with the onboarding of Visual Designer, Anant Fondekar, on 18th November.
Visual Design
After Anant?s onboarding, I spent the initial few days over calls, giving Anant an overview of the product and deep dive of the data entry app. Within a couple of days after that, he came up with the first draft of the visual design with a few key features. Then followed a few iterations to accommodate our feedback, the configurable and dynamic nature of the product and cover all the features. The final version came out on 18th December, exactly one month after the beginning. The Avni team is really happy with the output.
During this time, it was a good experience working with Anant as he was able to understand and accommodate the feedback quickly. During this course, he also gained a good understanding of the overall product.  We requested Persistent to continue him for some more time to work on providing visual design for other parts of the product like the Website, App designer and the offline mobile-based field app. Persistent has agreed to continue him for another month.
Training
Meanwhile, Persistent identified 3 UI developers and 1 Java developer for the project. The management team is working on identifying one more Java dev to be onboard.
Sidtharthan
from Avni core team travelled to Pune for 2 weeks to train the team. The training began on the 4th of December to cover the following agenda
For the last 2 days of the training,
Hiren
, another senior member from Avni core team also joined the team in Pune to facilitate estimation of the stories backlog and Iteration and release planning.
Training team during a break time
The training concluded with the team showcasing their learnings and release plan to Avni team and Tech4Dev.
The team has caught up well on different aspects covered in the training.
Development Process
While the training was going on, I worked with the tech lead and managers on the Persistent team to put up a process for development and collaboration. It was decided that the team will follow the Agile and Iterative development process with bi-weekly iterations, monthly releases, regular showcases, daily standups, unit tests, pull requests, continuous integration and deployment. Roles and responsibilities of different team members were agreed upon.
We also decided that we would have periodic meetings online for different teams to get together and share and learn about each other?s work.
Helping Avni become more community-oriented
During this training, we have received feedback on improvements needed for documentation to allow easy onboarding of new members. We have started working on the same.
This engagement with Persistent is not only significant to Avni in terms of development capacity and a major feature addition that will happen, but is also a good first step for us to become more open and community-oriented.
We are really happy how the first month of the engagement has gone. And we at Avni and Tech4Dev continue to be excited about this partnership.Title: 2022 Internship Experience at Glific

==================================================

A guest blog by our interns Mallika, Oju and Ryan.
This summer Tech4Devs very own Sanjeev Dharap took three undergraduates under his wing to introduce them to the ins and outs of the project, Glific. The students: Mallika, Ryan, and Oju share their experience of the first 6 weeks here!
What colleges are you from, where are you based, and what are your tentative future goals?
Mallika: Hi! Im a rising sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I hope to work in the Cogsci x CS field!
Ryan: Hi! I am a rising sophomore at Purdue University. I am planning on majoring in electrical and computer engineering with a focus on software and computer design.
Oju: Hi! I am a rising sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My hope is to use my computer science degree to combat the worlds injustices.
What have you done in the internship so far?
As of todays date, we have completed 6 weeks of our internship. Our initial tasks consisted of understanding the Glific project via blogs, demos on the website, and the GitHub repository (the latter was a bit daunting but necessary). Then, we began learning Elixir and Typescript. We focused on one language per week to allow for time to develop comfortability. Every Friday, we would have a code review either by Lobo, Akhilesh, Shamoon, or Sanjeev himself where each intern presented an exercise they were working on during the week. Additionally, we had tri-weekly stand-ups. After 4 weeks of this, we shifted to learning the basics of system design, API building, research, and lexical analysis where each intern would be assigned a small project to outline and present in the next meeting. For example, Ryan created a detailed outline for the system design of a library! Our current project is to create a lexical analysis for AWK.
What resources did you use to learn the coding languages?
To learn the languages in a structured format, we primarily used Exercism:  an open-source coding platform offering code practice and mentorship on 50 different programming languages. The languages documentation and associated playground, community solutions on the Exercism website, platforms like StackOverflow, and weekly code reviews helped us debug and reduce space/time complexity. Additionally, we often used the plethora of resources offering support with javascript to understand typescript better.
How did you like Elixir?
Elixir was very different from the programming languages that we were familiar with, but luckily the Exercism website that we used to learn Elixir has many resources that make it easy to pick up the language in a relatively small amount of time. Using the Exercism track for Elixir is very convenient, as lessons on relevant programming concepts, a vi interface for coding programs, and additional resources are all readily available. This makes it easy to go through multiple programs and grasp various concepts in a short period of time, making it easy to learn a language that might be unfamiliar to many.
How about Typescript?
Since the Exercism track for Typescript is less developed, all three of us found ourselves procrastinating the exercises a bit. However, once we got in the flow of it, we gained appreciation for the language. Typescripts syntax is more similar to Java (which a couple of us are very familiar with), meaning the code came more naturally to us compared to the functional language rules and syntax of Elixir. The applications for Typescript seemed very diverse. We also liked that typescript tutorials could be found anywhere on the internet since it is a very well-known language. Editing the text on common websites via the console was a fun, rather entertaining, skill that this new language gave us.
What have you learned besides the coding languages? (system design, API building, etc.)
After the first 5 weeks, we started alternating between programming and other CS-related facets. For example, each of us worked on a mini system design project of sorts, and honed our analytical thinking by specifying functional and technical requirements, designing data flow diagrams and API calls. Switching gears to a more high-level approach to the task at hand as opposed to dealing with details during our programming exercises kept things interesting!
How does this internship support your career goals
?
This internship offers an opportunity for those going into a computer science related career to explore their interests in a way that is unique. It introduces some of the aspects of a typical programming profession while being paced in a way that is tailored to students who dont have the same level of experience as working programmers. A lot of the time internships can struggle to find a healthy combination between these two aspects, but Tech4Dev strikes a good balance in this regard.
What do you like about Glific�s product and team?
There are many aspects to love about the product and employees of Glific! The product is catered toward NGOs and nonprofits that need extra support to create their admirable impacts. It is wonderful seeing technology being funneled in the direction of serving the community. The team has also been so welcoming and helpful. Sanjeev has CS and real life knowledge always on hand and has thoughtfully created the internship structure based on our needs, adjusting along the way as he observes our successes and challenges. The employees are always willing to help us debug our program or explain a concept to us despite their hectic schedules.
What advice would you give to future interns?
The breadth of exposure this internship provided was new to us! It really speaks to the polymathy of our mentor, Sanjeev Dharap. The projects we worked on came with a learning curve, and wed highly recommend embracing the process. Also, the Tech4Dev team is extremely helpful and responsive – and like Professor Dumbledore says, help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it – so dont hesitate to reach out!Title: 3 days induction into digital communication – Project Tech4Dev Glific cohort

==================================================

Long story short;
Civis
,
Headstreams
and
Save The Children India
have joined the Glific bandwagon. They will be using the two-way digital communication platform to carry out their programs. These NGOs impact people’s lives by hearing out their voices, making education available, supporting their well being respectively. At Glific,
we’re really excited to help them uplift many lives by creating a meaningful connectivity with their community.
The
Project Tech4Dev-Glific 5th cohort
which ran for 3 days(May 17-19) trained them on the best practices in communicating digitally with their end-users.
Unfortunately, Covid scenario in India made it difficult for some NGOs to continue with the cohort due to various challenges such as procurement of sim/phone numbers, availability of the team etc… To top it all, cyclones affecting the southern parts of India pushed things further for some others. We already feel a need for atleast 1-day session in the coming weeks for those who still want to continue. Overall, we hope things will get better soon. We will continue to extend ways to support them. We appreciate the efforts of the NGOs who could join us, here’s how they spent the 3 days:
Day 1
: Why & where to use the WhatsApp chatbot
The cohort started with each NGOs sharing what they hoped to achieve through Glific.
It was interesting to note that they wanted to start their community outreach & awareness programs using WhatsApp.
Explore data collection methods. Create linkage between citizen and government on policy matters. Explore new mechanisms for communication to create those crucial linkages. Especially when people preferred WhatsApp to share their opinions. Overcome lockdown to continue education, leveraging over 60% people having mobiles with access to WhatsApp even in rural areas. Printing worksheets & distributing it was operationally challenging & costly. There was a need for a more real-time channel for progress. The logistics of using various tool such as google sheets, forms etc… was difficult especially with a scale of 5000 students. There were still more creative ways other NGOs wanted solve challenges unique to their organisation.
After the discussion about goals & challenges, the
Tech4Good Community
team demonstrated all the
features of platform
so that it would become evident how Glific can help. This demonstration set precursor to the hands-on activity planned for day 2. We received a bunch of questions from all the NGOs – if you have any questions about Glific please feel free to message Glific team or ask our NGOs partners
on this channel
.
Day 2
: Building automated, digital conversation flows
The goal for day 2 was for each NGO to prepare the system for program launch. To interact with their beneficiaries, they had already architected their automated conversations on paper. It was time to move it to Glific. We divided ourselves into three teams, each team comprised of members of the NGO + 1 to 2 people from Glific and Tech4Good Community team. Since it was all happening on zoom, each team moved into their zone via breakout rooms. It gave them a space to discuss and seek individual help for their program. The energy and focus was really inspiring. The drive for their mission was clear in their curiosity to learn as much about the platform as possible and align it with their programs. Be it training the Kannada speaking folks in spoken English to prepare them for jobs, or enabling effective dialogue on draft laws and policies between citizens and their governments, or saving children’s lives through hearing aid intervention.
Using a new tool & technology generally requires time, practice, change in the behaviour which can be a daunting task. But in the company of others, through the cohort, it was wonderful to see collective learning. It’s almost as if people asked questions for each other by asking for themselves.
We’re glad that these NGOs moved a step ahead. They overcame the second hurdle which was to gain a confidence in using the right tool in a short span of time.
I believe each of the teams got a headstart for using the platform as opposed to weeks of discovery and exploration.
The 3 days were packed with a lot of information. Day-2 was where things came together through hands-on experience of the platform.
Day 3
: Accessing communication data for impact measurement
After the NGOs had created their flows, we went over some of the best practices and useful tips. This was a better time to think about optimising, cleaning up and organising their flows for a greater efficiency. We then moved into the more complex part which was about accessing & using the data itself. NGOs need to use BigQuery to save their data, DataStudio to generate graphs and charts and Google Cloud Storage to store media files. The Glific team demonstrated the integration of Google Cloud Storage and how NGOs can access their data on BigQuery. Since these tools can appear to be somewhat intimidating, seeing it through someone can make a big difference. Seeing it once can make it much more likely for NGOs to be self-sufficient in carrying out the required functions.
The NGOs were able to run their program end-to-end. From a beneficiary messaging them and going through the chatbot experience to monitoring and guiding them, and seeing all the data collected in BigQuery and create analysis charts on DataStudio.
Final words
The new WhatsApp medium can be a game-changer for NGOs whose programs depend on interacting with their communities on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. And yet, for any organisation, a lot goes into adopting new technologies and tools. Such as aligning budgets and processes, training teams, deploying the solution, iterating and growing it further if it helps them achieve results. The adoption can be made easier through a team and a community that is on a similar journey.Title: 5 Days of Learning, Collaboration, and Inspiration: Key highlights and takeaways [Karjat Sprint Apr �23]

==================================================

We concluded our second quarterly sprint of 2023 at Karjat, Maharashtra last week. This time we clubbed it with the Dasras annual retreat which made it even more collaborative and
fun. 5 days soaked in planning for the quarter, building strategies to take our product to the next level and building an even bigger ecosystem of NGOs that are interested in integrating tech for their programs. We also engaged with the Dasra team to see where we fit into their programs.This blog focusses on the sessions we had and what plans we have for the next quarter.
Morning talks
– Everyday we started with a morning talk. During these 5 days we touched upon different topics ranging from giving overview of our initiatives, (Development Data Platform + Product roadmap) to exploring inquiry based approaches to understand the why behind our areas of work (led by Swapneel, Director at GoalKeep). During the session, we did an activity to put down areas of inquiry and understand how we can ask the right key questions relevant for our programs. Every team member listed key questions on their area of inquiry and reframed it in such a way that it is quantifiable. Deval Sanghavi (co-founder, Dasra) gave us an opportunity to ask any questions we have on Dasra and ways in which we can collaborate better. Robert On from Agency Fund, gave a session on how we can use evidence to drive programs decisions.
Strategic planning for the quarter
We spent a good amount of time brainstorming and discussing plans for the next two quarters. Glifics focus will be on enhancing product features and taking product to new use cases such as running ticketing systems through WhatsApp chatbot. As Glific is in the scale phase, our focus for business development is to leverage existing networks and work towards building a stronger ecosystem of NGOs that would benefit not only from Glific but also from other Project Tech4Devs initiatives. We will be active on ground holding events and meet ups with our NGOs to know the work theyre doing and how we can support them better. Even for our Fractional CXO and DDP programs, we will be onboarding more fractional CXOs and NGOs partners.
Collaboration
During the retreat, we attended sessions led by the Dasra team and were impressed by the remarkable work they are accomplishing in the non-profit sector. We were given the chance to present our work and explore possibilities for partnering with Dasra and their network of NGOs through our initiatives. There were spaces to cross learn and understand the challenges faced by the NGOs across multiple sectors. We also had a fireside chat with Lobo where he shared that technology can be of great advantage to an NGO if they already have a strong/well tested program on the ground. Technology cannot be looked at as a standalone solution to the challenges faced by NGOs.
Key takeaways
Ask questions! Having an inquiry based approach for setting goals helped in understanding the why behind our work and also led to setting stronger yet realistic goals.
Collaboration unlocks new opportunities- Collaboration with Dasra, Agency Fund, added a lot of perspective to the work we do, and is also essential to address complex challenges, driving progress, and achieving sustainable growth.
Importance of working in person with the team! Spending not only working sessions together but also fun times during the sprint created a stronger bond with the team.Title: 6 Ways Avni is helping JSS Maternal, New-born, and Child health programs

==================================================

The article is authored by Ravindra Kurbude and was originally posted on
Avni Blog
. Ravindra is a coordinator for community health at Jan Swasthya Sahyog and has been our primary point of contact from JSS for this project. He has done Masters in Health Administration from Tata Institute of Social Sciences and has a keen interest in improving tribal health.
At
Jan Swasthya Sahyog
, we run a community health programme (or village health programme as we call it here) in 72 tribal villages located in the forest and forest-fringe areas of Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh. Under this programme are several programmes for different diseases and conditions.
Among them are MCH (Maternal and Child Health) and Phulwari. MCH programme is aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality rates by providing quality and comprehensive antenatal care, intrapartum, postpartum mother care, home-based neonatal care in programme villages. Phulwari is a programme aimed at preventing and addressing malnutrition among the children under 3 years and help their older sibling go back to school. We do this through rural creches where we provide the children nutritious food and a stimulating environment for learning and development.
With the beginning of the year 2020, we started the digital transformation of various programmes using Avni. We have first started with our MCH and Phulwari programs and started to use it from the month of March 2020. Avni provides an android app for field workers and supervisors and web-based reporting and dashboard for programme coordinators. Here is how it is helping us.
1. Instant data, decision support and reminders
The android app is available in Hindi with complete records available in the device and decision support at various places while entering the data into the app.
Earlier Phulwari supervisors had to refer to the gradation chart to know which child is in which nutritional grade. Now, the app calculates the z-score and tells the Phulwari supervisors nutritional grade of children and hence helps in the management of their nutritional status.
Growth Chart automatically plotted in the App
Likewise, the app is helping MCHWs in identifying on their own the sepsis in newborns, identifying high-risk pregnancies based on various data entered which was otherwise done by their field coordinators. Thanks to the highlighting of abnormal data fields, the MCHWs can easily identify high-risk conditions and take action.
App highlighting high-risk pregnancy based on entered data
Avni automatically schedules the visits as per our protocols. These scheduled visits act as reminders to users.
While sharing their experiences on the use of Avni app our MCH workers (MCHWs) and Phulwari supervisors mention that
they feel empowered and excited using this innovative technology in their work as they can now pull up real-time status reports of any pregnant women, newborn and under three years child. They can now track high-risk pregnancies very easily with the help of App and can provide continuous monitoring to such cases.
2. Efficient workforce supervision
Supervisor reviewing the work
Avni highlights overdue and cancelled visits along with reasons for cancelling them. Programme coordinators can pull this data in to monitor phulwari supervisors more easily. No missed visit goes unnoticed. Before Avni, it used to take 4-8 days for field coordinator to know the work done by field staff and for programme coordinator ranging from 7-15 days. Now with Avni, the delay has been reduced to one day for the villages where we have mobile network and 1-3 days for remote villages where we do not have mobile network and this is for both field and programme coordinator.
3. No more maintaining and carrying paper registers
MCH Worker maintaining paper registers
Earlier MCHWs had to maintain physical registers and paper records. They had to carry this to their meetings with respective beneficiaries and meetings with supervisors. They also had to periodically hand them over to a data entry operator to digitise this data into excel sheets.
Paper registers were bulky to carry, required multiple entries, and eventually, we still had to enter parts of it into excel sheets for reports. A lot of this cruft has now been eased.
4. Eliminated the delays and errors due to a workflow involving data entry operator
Earlier field workers used to bring and handover physical registers to a data entry operator stationed at our headquarters. The data entry operator would then put this data into excel sheets. Despite the best efforts by everyone, this process involved errors and delays. Now this workflow is eliminated as the data is captured by field workers directly while working and submitted to a server on cloud.
5. Saved time for data analysis and making reports for programme coordinators
Avni has reduced the time and efforts for data analysis for programme coordinators. Various reports can be generated by a single click and can be downloaded in the format we want. Earlier, we used to analyse the data either in excel or SPSS and then write a report for the MCH programme. For the Phulwari programme, we were using WHO Anthro software. Most of the time we had to use SPSS or excel for other various kinds of analysis for Phulwari children. These efforts and time are now taken care of by Avni itself. Reports can even be accessed in the field where the network is available.
Phulwari report
High risk pregnancy Report
6. Improving the social status of MCHWs
Our workers already enjoyed good respect in the community because of the services provided by them. The digital tool in their hands and data at their fingertips is further improving their social status in the community.
Worth mentioning here is the fact that all our workers are from the programme villages itself and have a rural or tribal background with limited formal education. Over the years they had developed the dexterity of working with paper formats and it was not easy for them to switch from paper-based work to entirely digitalised medium of reporting. However, due to simplicity and ease of use of Avni, they could gear up for the change and with constant hand-holding by Programme coordinators, in a very short span of time, are now enjoying working with Avni.
Thus, Avni deserves our attention not only for clinical and public health reason but for social and anthropological reasons as well.Title: 6 months of Persistent contributing to Avni data entry app

==================================================

Recap/Background
It’s been 6 months since
Persistent
team started working with
Avni
team to contribute to building the data entry app (online web app). We have talked about the start of this project in a?
previous blog post
.
Journey
After completing an initial 2-week face-to-face orientation cum training the team estimated all the stories and created a project plan.
Teams and responsibilities
: The Persistent team was split by front-end and back-end. Respective teams started working on their stories. Samanvay team members were responsible for guiding the product development direction, removing tech hurdles the team would face and merge the pull requests and signing off the work completed.
Avni Models and a revisit of design
: After we completed working on some initial stories related to subject dashboard and registration, we realized that we should have used our?
models
?module because we need to pass those models to our rules system. This was the first time that the team got introduced to the model. It took some time for them to understand how the models work and use them.
We started working on a spike to execute server-side rules. We decided to keep the rule execution on the server-side for performance reasons. At the end of the spike, we came up with an architecture where we use Node.js on the server-side to for rule execution. Again considering that the team was new to both product and tech stack, this was a complex task which team completed.
We started working on different form workflows like registration, enrolment, program encounter.
Most of the stories in form workflows require rules, so one of the streams simultaneously started working on server-side rule execution.
The team followed a 2-week iteration with demos at the end of each iteration.
COVID Impact
: Come mid-March, suddenly the COVID crisis and lockdown hit the country. Due to this, the team members without much preparation had to move to work from home. Most of the team members from Persistent were using the desktop machine and so they were left machine-less. They had to figure a machine to work on. As everything was shut down including commute it was a challenge to arrange for machines. It took about a couple weeks to get this sorted.
Due to various factors, the team was lagging much behind the plan. So we revisited and adjusted the timelines. Samanvay team also put in some additional capacity mid-way to catchup.
Initially, we had decided for a monthly release, however, we could not achieve this. The team was also assigned only till May. As the end of this duration was approaching, we decided to rearrange the priorities and do a
“Readonly App”
release. This would make something useful available for the clients.
At different points during this journey, Persistent kept putting in additional people for short duration like business analysts who helped the team put more details into the story and quality analysts who helped the team uncover the bugs.
Avni team kept benefitting from the Persistent UI designer for other features in Avni as well.
Learnings
It takes at least a month’s time for a new developer to get acquainted with Avni product.
It’s important to map the skill levels of team members before we start the project. If required, start with extensive training that makes the fundamentals of the used technologies very clear.
For a project of this size and complexity, it’s vital to have a full-time and full-stack tech lead on the project from the start.
All members of the team have to focus on developing full-stack understanding. They don’t have to be able to write the other stack code but they should be able to understand it from a high level.
Existing big JavaScript codebase can be hard to understand. We require more comments and documentation like Entity-Relationship Diagrams. Maybe in future, we can explore using TypeScript which makes it easier to understand big codebases by the virtue of having types.
Code Reviews:
Pull requests have to be small. It’s very hard to review big pull requests well.
Current Status
Readonly App is released to production. If you would like to try this out visit
https://app.avniproject.org/
. If you don’t have the credentials you can
sign up for free
and get one for you.
Persistent extended team allocation by at least another couple of months. Yayy!!
With the experience in the last 6 months, it was realised it would be better for the team to learn tech stack in a focussed manner. For the last two weeks, they are taking training from Sanjeev Dharap, one of the senior-most members from Tech4Dev. The training would complete this week with the team members demonstrating what they have learnt through the course.
What’s next
After the team completes the training they will resume work on the project and try to finish from the following as much as possible
Integration of rules with web app
Encounter workflow
Full-fledged search with support for custom filters
Access Control
Location, Subject data types in forms
Support for Groups and Household
Growth Chart/Vaccination
Attendance
My Dashboard
Acceptance Tests
We will also continue to work on improving the documentation and engagement practices.
It’s absolutely essential for an open-source product like Avni’s growth and development to have a vibrant community with such contributions on the development front as well. And this has been a first-of-its-kind and a very enriching experience. We have had many opportunities to learn and grow on people, process and product.
We continue to be thankful to Persistent for this.Title: 66A zombies continue to menace free speech on the internet: Update on Internet Freedom Foundation’s 66A Zombie Tracker Project

==================================================

Tl;dr
Last week a flurry of complaints were filed against news anchor Arnab Goswami for, amongst other things, ?inciting communal hatred? under various provisions of the IPC and also included, was a charge under the now defunct  Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). S. 66A  of the IT act has been struck down, by the Supreme Court, as unconstitutional in 2015. However, despite
repeated directions
by the SC, that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed and also that no fresh charges may be registered, the provision continues to be invoked across the country.
#IndiaVSSection66A
Last week,
at least 16 complaints were made
at various police stations all over India, against news anchor Arnab Goswami. The complaints were filed in respect of comments made on his news show,  on 21st April 2020, for, amongst other things, ?inciting communal hatred?. On the basis of these complaints,
FIRs were filed under multiple provisions
against Arnab Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir. The complaints  mention offences under Sections 117, 120B, 153, 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504, 505, 506 etc of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000(IT Act) .
S. 66A of the IT act, introduced by amendment in 2008, penalized sending “offensive messages” via online communication. The wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. For example, in May 2014,
five students were temporarily detained in Bangalore for allegedly sharing a message on the mobile application ?WhatsApp? that was critical of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi
.  To combat this a case was filed before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was unconstitutional.
In March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon?ble Supreme Court in
Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India
as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Court found that S. 66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalise even innocent speech. Significantly, the Court found that the provision was not ?severable? i.e., no part of the section could be saved and the provision as a whole was declared unconstitutional. This would have meant that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.
#UnconstitutionalProsecutionsExposed
In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have ended there. However, a 2018 study, ?
Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies
?, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision.
Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (?PUCL?), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court’s decision. Prior to the hearing, in a
counter-affidavit,
the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on S. 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on S. 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded. For instance,
Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional
and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019,
not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered
. The SC further directed that  the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.
Inspite of the above, fresh claims were still instituted, as recently as last week, under the now unconstitutional provision. In January 2020, the
Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act
. As recent as February 2020,
a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged under S.66A of the IT Act
, arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ?Sanatan dharma?. In March 2020,
the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners accused of offences, amongst others, under S.66A of the IT Act
. They had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.
#IFFBatsForDigitalRights
This is not about Arnab Goswami, but about the use of an unconstitutional provision of law. Even today people, ordinary smartphone users all across India are being prosecuted across the breadth of India. A casual search through the
IndianKanoon database
(like Pintoo Kumar) shows cases of FIRs being actively prosecuted as recently as March, 2020. This is more than 5 years after a Supreme Court judgement and is a stain on our criminal justice system.
Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is committed to erasing Section 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. The journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with
CivicData Labs
. We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. S. 66A must die a complete constitutional death.

Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

Actually, this article can also be phrased as, “7 of my favorite pet peeves in the sector”. Note that this is about the sector, so it encompasses funders, NGOs, and foundations. This has come about based on my interactions with various folks over the past year, and I wanted to get this out there. Nothing new or surprising, but all in one place 🙂
Be responsive
: Respond to email communication (from known connections) in a timely manner, i.e. within 1 – 2 business days. This is applicable to both NGOs and funders. Your response could indicate you are busy and you will get back to them in the next week or so. It is ok to say: no if you are not interested in pursuing that thread. The communication part is important.
Be specific
: If you are seeking a meeting or a connection, explain why you want to meet and/or connect. It makes it easier for everyone, and also serves as a mini-introduction. If you are conducting a webinar, think about: “The top three things I want listeners to walk away with”. Ensure it’s worth their time and your time.
Be prepared:
Go into a meeting having done your homework. If a deck was shared, read or skim it before you join the call. If you are meeting a funder, do some background research on both the funder and the foundation so you have a better idea of who/what they fund and do.
Be open and transparent:
If you are taking someone’s time to research a specific area, make sure you share your findings. I’ve had to refuse calls with prominent consulting firms in the sector, who want to discuss in detail: technology, open-source, and tools used in the sector, but will not make their research public. Yes, sad but true 🙁
Be honest:
I sit in a weird place, as both a funder and a grantee, and hence see both sides of the coin. I’d encourage more NGOs to be upfront with funders on decisions or events that make their life hard. This is a super hard thing to do. I did this last week, but I had to spend a day thinking about how I could phrase the disagreement in as nice a manner as possible. It worked out great, because the funder was super open also, and we had an honest and clear conversation. It is important for all of us grantees, to make things clear to funders, especially when it impacts our organization and/or our work.
Be curious and passionate:
It is important for all of us to look outside our own little box and see what others are doing. Attend a webinar or two in areas outside your areas of interest or expertise. Read an article (or two) on a daily basis and keep abreast of the latest happenings. The nice thing about this is you can share your findings with your network many a time. Most of you have received mail from me, stating “You might find this interesting”. See how organizations similar to you are approaching problems, and what you can reuse from their work. The more you enjoy the work you are doing, the more productive you are.
Take care of yourself:
This is especially for the young founders out there who are working so hard and long on things they believe in and want to make a difference. Life is short, work will always be there in a never-ending pile. Ensure you spend a few hours a day (at least 4 hours) beyond work and sleep. Read, Exercise, Meditate, Do What You Need to Do, but take a step back every day. I find that solutions to various things I’m dealing with come to me during my long bike rides and walks in the middle of the day, even when I’m actively not thinking about it. (there is lots of research to support this). Your health and well-being are more important to you and your family in the long run.

==================================================

Am sitting in Mumbai airport, 4:50 am in the morning, heading back home to SF to Mari and PJ, and I’m super glad its a long long flight (I need to catch up on my sleep and I’m just exhausted, getting old does suck in this regard). I’m glad that we seem to be getting out of COVID and we can meet and interact in person, have great conversations and meals with teammates, and learn from amazing individuals: Ishita@MukkaMaar, Jacob@Bandhu, Akshay@Avanti, and Jithin@Make a Difference, about what they do, and what inspires and motivates them.
As with all my trips to India and meetings, I always come back inspired and excited about what we are doing and ideas for how we can do things even better. Some of the things that happened over the week include:
Worked together as a team and discussed where Glific is headed and the features we need to add to the platform. It’s amazing how quickly we can progress when all of us are in the same room. We solved a couple of thorny issues really quickly.
Met and interacted with a few of our partner NGOs, and get a better understanding of what they are trying to do. Having in-depth conversations with NGOs on their use cases, and how best we can help them is super important and guides our design and development process.
Revised the
Tech4Dev v2
plan and let the senior members of the team interact and pitch the concept to existing and new funders. Giving folks on the team exposure to funders and the ecosystem is super important as we aim to get them to step up and run the platforms soon.
Spent time with the young women and girls from Sharanam both at the home and also outside on different outings. The Tech4Dev teams met and interacted with the Sharanam Girls different times. It is helpful to the Sharanam youth to see what we are doing and why. It also help the Tech4Dev team see a larger purpose in the issues that the NGO sector is attempting to solve.
We had two dinners where the team interacted with the founders of
Make a Difference (MAD)
and
Avanti Fellows
. In addition to great food, the team was inspired by the stories and passion that both Jithin (MAD) and Akshay (Avanti) shared about the reasons they started their organizations.
While the trip was great in most aspects, we also had meetings which were not as successful as we would have hoped for. Getting folks to be open, transparent and sharing in the sector is a long slow process, and we’ll have to keep working at it. This is frustrating, but at the same time we understand it is part of the journey that we’ve chosen to undertake.
As with all our sprints, we encourage everyone to blog about their experiences and learnings. Here are a few that have already been posted

==================================================

When Krishna told me,
“We have two new joinees, and both will be part of the product team,”
my instant reaction was,
Wooohhh, wow!
I am always excited when someone new joins — they bring fresh energy, new perspectives, and a whole new vibe to the organisation.
Then she asked,
“Would you like to be the buddy for both of them?”
and I smiled and said,
Of course, I would be happy to.
Inside, I felt quite excited and confident this time about helping them settle in.
This time, it was Fawas and Tanu — two different personalities, two different styles, but the same curiosity in their eyes on Day 1.
As their buddy, I knew I would be guiding them through the first steps — answering questions, sharing little tips, and making sure they felt right at home.
Somewhere in between my initial calls and Discord chats with Fawas and Tanu, I had a little déjà vu.
It took me back to last year when Priyesh joined. He came in with so much energy, doing his best on each task with determination. Watching him grow from a newcomer to a confident contributor has been one of my proudest buddy moments.
Back to the present — when I watch Tanu and Fawas, there’s something in the way they speak and ask questions that feels so genuine.
Fawas made me realise the importance of fresh thinking. His approach showed me that sometimes, a different perspective can simplify things I might have been overcomplicating.
Fun fact:
He is also a great photographer — now that he is part of the Tech4Dev tribe, we can expect some top-notch candid shots at our sprints!
Tanu’s conversations with me reminded me how powerful active listening can be. She took her time to understand before speaking, and when she did share, it was always thoughtful and full of insight.
Fun fact:
Tanu’s creativity is unmatched — give her FigJam and she will be coming up with  beautiful designs like magic.
Priyesh taught me that adaptability and consistency can take you a long way. He never hesitated to ask questions, and he reminded me that learning is a journey, not a race.
Fun fact:
He is all-rounder — incredibly detail-oriented, and also a terrific actor. His “
Kanpur accent with paan in mouth
” wala acting deserves a stage show!
My key learnings from this buddy journey:
Be curious, patient, and a good listener – keep asking why and how, remember that everything takes its own time to click, and try to step into a newcomer’s shoes.
Be open-minded – new people can teach you as much as you teach them.
Trust your inner voice – if something feels off, pause and rethink.
Being a buddy isn’t just about teaching tasks. It’s about showing the
why
behind it, giving confidence to ask any question, and celebrating every small win. It’s also about being there when things get tricky — whether it’s a confusing process, a missing doc, or shifting priorities.
Now, a few weeks in, I can already see Fawas and Tanu finding their rhythm, just like Priyesh did last year. And I know that, one day, they will be the ones guiding someone new, passing on the same warm welcome they received.Title: A Collaborative Journey at the Project Tech4Dev Sprint in Udaipur!

Hey there! As the Communications Head at Prod, I recently had the privilege of being a part of an extraordinary event – the Project Tech4Dev sprint in the beautiful city of Udaipur. And let me tell you, it was one of a kind experience that blew me away!
Picture this – a formal yet informal setting, where stakeholders from across the spectrum – donors, NGO partners, friends, and of course, us – gathered to work collaboratively and drive meaningful change. Stepping into the world of offline collaboration with Sprint was an eye-opening experience. This event organized by Project Tech4Dev, served as a platform for learning, networking, and witnessing firsthand the impactful contributions made by non-profit organizations. The concept of a Sprint in the Indian development sector was a first, and it was incredible to witness the collective passion to inspire social change.
At Prod, we are always on the lookout for impactful initiatives, and Project Tech4Dev truly impressed us. Their use of tech platforms like Glific to resolve communication-related challenges faced by NGOs left us in awe. It’s amazing to see how tech need not be intimidating; instead, it can amplify the impact of social interventions.
The best part? Project Tech4Dev has created a warm, safe, and happy space for this community to thrive. They reinforce a collaborative approach towards work and social good, and I’m genuinely thankful for the environment they’ve fostered.
During the sprint, our team conducted a storytelling workshop, sharing the art of communicating impact to invite more participation towards the cause. The level of participation and commitment in the room was simply heartwarming, and it fueled our motivation to drive social change even further.
And let’s not forget the morning walks in the picturesque city of lakes! It was a breath of fresh air – soothing, fun, and the perfect opportunity to meet old and new friends while building upon the body of work.
I’m already looking forward to the next Sprint, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this amazing community of changemakers. Together, we are making a real difference, and that’s something to celebrate!

As I arrived at
Sawela Lodge
in Naivasha last Sunday morning, I felt the weight of fatigue from travel lift as I absorbed the stunning landscape and the contagious energy of the workshop attendees. My purpose here was to contribute to a workshop organized by The Agency Fund (TAF) and Project Tech4Dev, their first sprint in Africa. Bringing together TAF’s grantee partners and various organizations working (over 50 participants from ~20 organizations) in the social sphere of data and technology, the workshop proved to be an enlightening experience.
�Later in the week, I also had the privilege of being part of the co-hosting team for a full-day ‘Unconference’ event held in Nairobi. It was an experience that left a lasting impression on me, thanks to the exceptional warmth, support, and expertise exhibited by our co-hosts:
Project Tech4Dev
,
KujaLink,
East Africa Philanthropy Network
,
Let’s Create Africa
, and Global Giving. Their collaboration and dedication significantly enriched the event (with over 80 participants), fostering an environment conducive to meaningful dialogue and collective learning. The insights gained from this event were truly profound. Fortunately, we saw participation from numerous Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and had the opportunity of hearing from community leaders with invaluable lived experiences. What stood out as the greatest achievement to me was the creation of a safe space where individuals were eager to openly share, absorb knowledge, and engage in meaningful exchanges.
From our first meal together to our farewells, I was enriched with new insights and compelling data stories from diverse individuals and nonprofit organizations. Here are my top reflections from this trip:
Data as a lever to navigate the complexities of non-profit endeavours:
Nonprofits globally face similar hurdles in their growth journeys, from scaling programs, securing funding to cultivating a robust data culture.  A resounding agreement resonated among participants at the Naivasha event: timely, data-driven decision-making as the cornerstone of success. On the other hand in Nairobi, for most CBOs data storytelling and fundraising seemed most pressing challenges and it does make sense! CBOs globally need support to access networks, resources and capacity building support to articulate the value of their work.
At both event, there was a collective understanding that informed decisions, rooted in robust data analysis, pave the path towards sustainable impact. In essence, the ability to harness data effectively isn’t just a capability; it’s the very essence of organizational resilience and efficacy in the ever-evolving landscape of social change.
Empowering employees for organizational excellence and social impact:
Empowering individuals at every level with the requisite skills, access to data, and cultivating a supportive environment serves as the bedrock for nurturing a culture of informed decision-making. With an opportunity to run a Data Culture session in Naivasha, I realised this approach democratizes data utilization, ensuring that insights aren’t confined to a select few but are accessible to all stakeholders. The discussions during this workshop also pushed participants to think about equipping their team members with the tools and knowledge to interpret and leverage data effectively. A few of them also highlighted the need to create a supportive environment that encourages open dialogue, where questions are welcomed, and insights are collaboratively explored.
While Data Culture did not come up as a critical focus in Nairobi, and the reason for that I think is to do with the stage of organizations the attendees here are still grappling with initial growing pains to establish their programs.
The power of experimentation & learning in the organization
: Solving complex societal issues demands innovation and experimentation. The panel discussion at Naivasha highlighted that funders must exhibit trust and openness, providing nonprofits with the space and resources to innovate. Nonprofits, in turn, must prioritize evidence generation and invest in suitable technology and practices for effective data management and communication. My learning that I promise to take back to my team and work is Experimentation. Experimentation empowers us to challenge the status quo, explore new approaches, and iterate based on real-world feedback. It encourages a mindset of curiosity and risk-taking, where failure is viewed not as a setback, but as an opportunity for growth and refinement. Every experiment, whether successful or not, yields valuable insights that inform future decision-making.
Breaking silos to cultivate community:
Silos within and between organizations inhibit progress. Creating opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange fosters trust, ownership, and camaraderie and both the events make even a stronger case for this. Unstructured spaces like an outing to
Crescent Island
helped us make friends on this trip and we promised to not work in our own silos but stay in touch and exchange experiences regularly. Another interesting conversation I had with few of these friends at Naivasha was on the role of leadership. We discussed that while leadership plays a critical role, it’s essential for individuals at all levels to embrace their roles as everyday leaders, driving change through collaboration and shared learning.
A lot of the attendees also shared silos often emerge within organizations, creating divisions between teams that limit flow of data & insights. Additionally, I feel silos also exists between organizations within the same sector, hindering the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices. By dismantling these silos and fostering connections, nonprofits can create community of practise for a more cohesive and supportive ecosystem.
Advocating for regular but inclusive and diverse participation:
Throughout both the Naivasha workshop and the Nairobi Unconference, it became evident that true progress in the realm of social impact requires the active participation and representation of diverse voices and perspectives. While reflecting on the discussions and interactions, it was apparent that inclusivity isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a fundamental principle that underpins the effectiveness of nonprofit endeavours. From the engagement of community leaders to the collaboration between organizations of various sizes and backgrounds, there was a palpable sense of value in embracing diversity. Not only in Kenya, there is a need even back home here in India to advocate for inclusive practices and ensuring equitable access to safe spaces for sharing and learning on a regular basis.
In summary, these reflections underscore the importance of collaboration, innovation, and a collective commitment to leveraging   data and technology for social impact. By breaking down barriers and fostering a culture of continuous learning and experimentation, nonprofits can enhance their effectiveness and drive meaningful change in their communities.Title: A Day in Mumbai – Women in Tech & Tech4Dev

==================================================

Last week, Donald Lobo came down to India for the Glific sprint and I got a wonderful opportunity to visit Mumbai and meet him and the ColoredCow team. The agenda of the visit was simply to get to know each other and also attend a couple of meetings with key stakeholders at a few philanthropic foundations to talk to them about Tech4Dev v2 and Women in Tech (a collaboration between Tech4Dev, ColoredCow and HyperVerge Academy). You can read more about Women in Tech
here
. It was a whirlwind day packed with meetings, travel and conversations – heres my attempt to summarize what went on.
8:30AM – Landing in Mumbai, Meeting Lobo and the ColoredCow Team
After landing in Mumbai, it took me a good 1 hr to reach Lobos house in Colaba where I was greeted by the Glific team. I got a chance to spend some in-person time with Akhilesh Negi – one of our mentors for the Women in Tech batches (and make a guest appearance on their daily standup), while observing Abhishek Sharma (who leads the product at Glific) devouring 4-5 eggs one after the other!
Our plan- we had a total of 3 meetings scheduled with funders, scattered across the day (and the city) and we decided to wrap the day with a visit to the Sharanam center before heading back. Lobo was kind enough to plan the entire day taking into account travel times etc to ensure I have a super productive day and make it in time for my flight 🙂
11:30AM – Building an Ecosystem
Our first meeting with one of the 3 foundations was one of my first experiences pitching about our work in-person to a decision maker. It was Lobo talking about the last 2 years of work in Tech4Dev v1, the plan for Tech4Dev v2, Abhishek pitching in about the success seen with Glific and me talking about the WIT pilot.
The big theme of the conversation was about working together to create an ecosystem where social impact organizations can leverage tech solutions from each other and not have to reinvent the wheel. Conversations about what different NGOs are doing to tackle certain problems were discussed. An interesting line of discussion was about how a lot of NGOs are not prepared to work with tech and how a tech product may not actually solve their problems. It was good learning about not force-fitting solutions when they dont make sense in a particular context.
Specific to WIT, we received advice to make sure women who get placed at the end of the program, also end up staying in their jobs and not quit a few months down the line. This gave us further reinforcement to strengthen our alumni community engagement initiatives, and make sure whoever enters the HVA/WIT ecosystem once, is always part of the community and our intervention never really ends. We believe in the philosophy of paying it forward, and expect our alumni to also join back and mentor more students in the future.
We also got to know about other organizations working on a similar problem as WIT. In the spirit of sharing and building on each others work – we concluded the meeting by aligning on making relevant connections and reaching out to the organizations recommended, looking for ways to collaborate.
Somewhere around 1PM – Vada Pav Break
Between the two meetings, we got the chance to squeeze in some time for a classic butter Vada pav right in front of Victoria Terminal (had only seen this in the movies!) Would highly recommend visiting
Aram Vada Pav
if you find yourself in Mumbai sometime 🙂
1:30PM – What are Funders Looking For?
Our second meeting followed a similar pattern with each of us talking about our experiences and the work we are doing. There was a discussion of forming a collective among funders to align on common reporting mechanisms in order to ease the burden on non profits for the same. I learnt about how foundations undertake various capacity building initiatives for the non profits they fund. There was again a focus on allowing the non profits from similar sectors to learn from each others work during these programs.
Advice I received from this meeting on WIT was to be clear about whether we want to scale as an organization or not. It was refreshing to note that there are quite a few non profits who are very clear that they are not built to scale, and that is okay, and funders also support them on the same. From a personal standpoint, I refined my pitch for WIT a bit more in this meeting based on some tips I received after the last meeting – learnings ahoy!
Around 3:30PM – A short interaction with the folks at Bandhu
Once we headed back to Lobos house where the Glific sprint was happening, I got a chance to hear from Rushil about their work in leveraging tech to connect workers with jobs and housing at
Bandhu
. They also gave us a demo of their app and threw some light on the challenges faced in tech adoption and how to account for that. Some interesting examples were- minimal text on the app to account for most of the workers not being literate, reducing the complexity of workflows, figuring out how to deal with a situation where the worker doesnt carry a smartphone while at work, and so on. None of us had all the answers, but it was a super interesting discussion (maybe thats what made it interesting).
4:30PM – Keep it Open from Day -1
The conversation during our final meeting for the day had renewed focus on the philosophy of open source. Many a time we tell ourselves – This is not in a condition or state to be shared with other people. Let me share it with people once it is
ready
. Lobo spoke about how
ready
is a pipe-dream, how wed only be fooling ourselves if we think that wed start sharing when we attain that state of ready. He spoke about the importance of getting into the mindset of sharing from Day -1. We also discussed how if we are building something for the public good, we should be giving the public ownership of it, and let each other build on top of things.
This is something I can personally relate to as well, in a different context. We always wanted to write a blog sharing our work at HV Academy (our philosophy, curriculum, method of screening etc), and never got around to doing it. Getting pushed by Lobo to write about some of our work a month ago, and right now as I am writing this, is helping us get over that resistance. If you are a person thinking twice about writing/sharing your work with the world, go ahead and do it! You may not reap the benefits of it today, but somebody somewhere may be inspired by what youve done, and the second order impact could be immense 🙂
I think my pitch is also getting much better by now 🙂
6:30PM – Visit to Sharanam Center for Girls and Heading Back
My last visit to
Sharanam Center
was like the cherry on top to a whirlwind day full of learnings. I used this time to just relax, spend some time with the girls, play games, learn about their dreams and aspirations, what they want to do in their lives and also what they DONT want to do in their lives (which overwhelmingly turned out to be sitting on a desk behind a computer, which sadly didnt help for my women in tech narrative ????)
I managed to find one girl who seemed to be rather excited about HTML and CSS, and building websites. Hoping to stay in touch with her and help in some way in pursuing her aspirations. I also learnt about all the wonderful work done by the caretakers in managing this center which put a lot of things into perspective for me personally and inspired me to continue doing what I do with renewed vigor. Before I left, I received a giant hug from a tiny girl for a good 10 seconds which honestly, just made my day!Title: A New Solution for the Bay Area’s Continuum of Care

==================================================

By Jessica Hubley, CEO @AnnieCannons
In every
AnnieCannons
class, we brainstorm problems that led to the exploitation of the human trafficking survivors in our classroom. Since our very first class, one problem has come up again and again:
The continuum of care – or the series of services and interventions necessary to see a survivor permanently leave their situation of exploitation and build economic independence – has material gaps.
Some survivors experience these gaps when they are asked to personally call a long list of phone numbers to see whether they are even qualified to receive help from that provider, which drives disappointment and hopelessness, and may even require the retelling of a traumatic personal story. Some survivors describe needing to “hack” the system to actually get what they needed in ways they want to share with others to save future survivor in need necessary pain and re-traumatization. Still others note that the services an organization claims to provide (particularly mental healthcare) are not really available, or not available from a professional qualified to offer those services. Our Bay Area students generally report being in an out of 3-7 shelters before joining our program and finding their path to economic self-sustenance.
Service providers, on the other hand, are struggling to secure funds to operate – and this struggle is especially poignant in the Bay Area, where AnnieCannons currently recruits. High housing prices mean much fundraising is required to provide shelter itself, and funders often expect that a shelter facility will provide Case Management and other elements of the continuum of care, too. Shelters, especially those that use government grants to operate, face onerous and often nonsensical grant reporting requirements that dictate their data collection and handling practices – even where human beings could be better served in another way.
Many groups have built case management platforms intended to help shelters, case managers, and other workers in the continuum of care manage their beneficiaries. Often, the reason cited to us by a Bay Area shelter for not using that tool is simply “we have too many places we have to enter data already.” In addition, these tools are designed with the assumption that one individual is one case to one organization, so they do not endeavor to track where multiple organizations have served the same survivor, what services they provided, or how effective those services are.
The process of referring a survivor to other organizations along the continuum of care is also friction-full. First, organizations face confidentiality concerns in telling another org about an individual survivor, and have no decent means of recording survivors’ consent to share info on more than paper forms. One Executive Director told us that if we could simply automate the printing of contact information and directions to accompany a referral, we’d save her staff considerable time.
Now, AnnieCannons is working with Tech4Dev, and with the support of the Chintu Gudiya Foundation, to conduct detailed product research on a survivor-centered solution. Over the years, it has become clear to us that the myriad issues around successfully applying technology to close gaps in the continuum of care – from survivor privacy and confidentiality, to survivor -re-trafficking, to traffickers monitoring phones, to impact reporting, to full feedback loops about services received and provider criteria, to effective referrals, to avoiding re-traumatization – are simply better solved by a solution that puts the survivor at the center of the design process.
Along the way, we’ll consulting closely with a select group of Bay Area housing and case management providers to carefully analyze the technologies they use, their pain points in using that technology, their core needs, and any process upgrades (including both analog techniques and free digital tools they may not be using yet).
We will continue to post here about the scope and process of our research, but if you are a Bay Area shelter or case management provider and you would like to participate in the consulting offering, please email info@anniecannons.com.Title: A Quarter with Fractional CTO at Reap Benefit

==================================================

If you were expecting deets on a conversation we had over drinks by the beach at the Glifics sprint in Goa, then I am sorry you have read the title wrong, Quarter here is referring to 3 months we spent working closely fractional CTO

Reap Benefit
is on the mission to activate young people of India (whom we refer to as Solve Ninjas)  to become custodians of their neighbourhoods and build hyper local antifragile communities that are rooted in their local contexts while being connected by technology. Over a decade of Reap Benefits existence 112,000+ solve ninjas have been activated across 12 states, who have taken 94,000+ actions towards solving civic and climate problems.
This blog is about Project Tech4Devs collaboration with Reap Benefit to help us onboard (and afford) human resources with deep tech capabilities to enhance the work we have been doing  as a tech enabled grassroots organisation.
Why we chose fractional CTO over full time CTO
Reap Benefit has had about 10 years of experience in being a tech enabled grassroots organisation. While we know our ground, users and customers well, and we know how to get  adaption, we needed help on developing robust systems and doubling down on the learnings we have to prepare for the long term and build platforms that add value to the ecosystem at large.
This seemed like a perfect challenge for a high potential resource to come and solve over a defined period of engagement. Also when I mentioned this has helped us to afford the talent, i was not kidding.
6 ways in which the fractional CTO helped accelerate our tech journey
1- Created platform that provides framework to prove that climate and civic actions lead to activating 21st century skills in the youth
Presenting the solve ninja
leaderboard
and
civic identity profiles
.

There are young people across India, urban and rural, there are citizen volunteers working with local bodies who are solving problems everyday by building solutions, creating and participating in campaigns and engaging the civic authorities to work on problems. This platform is providing the feedback of the type of skill activated through these actions taken and a visibility of similarly active citizen champions across the country.
Thoughts shared by solve ninjas on seeing their work get a digital identity
Rated 4.5/5 on the overall look and utility of this platform.

In verbatim feedback from the users
It helps me as a solve ninja reflect on my journey, giving me both a sense of satisfaction for the work done and retrospection for the work yet to be accomplished. Besides it also provides an opportunity for all of us to learn and get inspired from each others journeys. from Samarth J, a solve ninja from Bengaluru
2- Platform for visualising crowdsourced, crowd verified hyper local civic and climate data

3- Helping the team to think structured and more process oriented
While Reap Benefit has been a tech-enabled for a long while, and also ahead of the curve in adapting to technology to scale the impact (if i say so myself)  there are still gaps in the way the team developed and deployed tools, relying heavily on the prototyping DNA, As a veteran of technology space, our fractional CTO asked us right questions to  help us set processes which will help the team to get more product oriented, and put our minds and energy together for sustaining tech operations over a longer period of time.
Also as a fractional CTO, they are also able to bring learning from functioning of the NGO where they are splitting time, thus adding to the research and making decisions from a more informed space of the ecosystem as a whole.
Screenshot simple tools to get more process oriented.
4- Optimising cost of operations
Having a veteran of the industry helped us re-look at how we were utilising the servers and moving things around as per usage and cut down some of the costs. Also by leveraging the network of human resources in the tech space, they were able to get us help in terms of part time consultants who were willing to devote time for the cause at a lower price point than industry standard while doing work that was above par in the industry.
5- Cyber Security and Data Protection
Cyber security is an increasing concern especially as we scale and are custodians of personally identifiable information as well as sensitive personal information. Having the right person with the right connections to navigate the world of cyber security becomes an exceedingly important need of the hour for non-profits looking to scale by leveraging technology. As the saying goes, better to be safe in investing time and resources in this, than to be sorry in losing the trust of the ecosystem and the beneficiaries.
6- Pushing the teams towards tech adaption and closer collaboration internally
Having spent 3 months with the team, we had them driving the tech (midfield) team harder to collaborate more closely internally across the org, with the frontline who is on ground, with the fundraising who is pitching the org and involve them in the decision making, thus adding complexity but also an important step towards building trust, and a more sustainable way towards increasing the adaption of the tools to drive exponential impact towards the mission.
The next part of the blog is important to not put out an overly positively biassed point of view, and be transparent to share both the pros and cons. If youre reading this from the project tech4dev team, then please take it with a pinch of salt, and here is a picture of the team working happily together to assure that alls positively well
Nonetheless, there are probably too many things on the plate for one problem solver to take up
This is the human psychology (or maybe just the Indian parent mentality) of always wanting more. Having access to the high capacity team members and wanting them to be contributing more knowing the potential they have is a constant gnawing feeling. Of course they could be doing something more to add value to the mission at Reap Benefit, had their time not split 2 and half ways.
But overall to summarise,  for a sector that is struggling with retaining the tech talent, building tech capacity, and driving tech adoption this is another one of Project Tech4Devs excellent initiatives that is helping build the capacity of nonprofits to use technology as well as building the ecosystem as a whole.Title: A Week With MAD
Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: August 2025
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/a-week-with-mad/
==================================================

There’s a scene in my fav movie
Dil Chahta hai
where
Aamir Khan
mentions “
You know what? Hume har saal kam se kam ek hafte goa aana chaiye
” and this is my 4th trip in last 3 years and I was very happy about it. Here’s a beach photo I took as soon as I reached
I didn’t expect MAD’s office to be in Goa. When I walked in, my first question to Akshay was, “
Why Goa
?” He laughed and said, “
People here work really hard here. We wanted to be close to nature. It keeps us grounded—and it’s sustainable.
” Fair answer. The place already felt good.
The standup I wish more teams did
I sat in on their standup, and it wasn’t the usual checklist of tasks. Everyone shared how they were feeling—about work, about last week, about life. A few people spoke about being tired, someone was excited, someone else joked about getting a bit drunk over the weekend. They also shared gratitude—who helped them, who showed up. It was simple, open, and human. I liked that.
How we got here
I’ve been working with MAD for about 8–10 months now. I started talking to Akshay around November (can’t remember if it was last year or this year). Getting time with him was tough. He wears a lot of hats—tech choices, experiments, data work, vendor management, people, leadership updates… if it’s important, he’s probably involved.
We agreed to a small consulting block—50 hours—to get the basics in place. Pretty quickly it became clear that they didn’t just want a data warehouse for dashboards; they wanted the warehouse to be the backbone for other apps too, so systems could talk to each other cleanly. That changed the plan. Before any analytics, we needed to make the plumbing sound.
So we set a goal: one week in person. Clear list. Clear outcomes.
Days 1–3: Fix the foundation
Akshay and I created a list of all the tasks to be completed during the week and remained focused on accomplishing them throughout.
The first three days were all about the base layers.
Reviewed their architecture
and trimmed AWS costs where it made sense.
Separated the data warehouse
from the internal application database. It’s a boring sentence, but it matters. Cleaner boundaries mean fewer surprises later.
Rebuilt the data pipeline
, end to end.
While we were at it, I sat with their developer and showed them how to build a connector in Dalgo. With the new UI, we got one up in about half an hour. That moment landed. “Wait, that’s it?” Surprise—followed by relief.
We still need to figure out access to the staging Airbyte so the team can run this themselves. We also walked through dbt—how to structure models, name things, and keep the project maintainable. The goal wasn’t to impress them; it was to hand them the keys.
The part I was quietly excited about
I came in with a small agenda: show them how AI can boost their internal capacity—not as a shiny demo, but as a daily tool.
We tried two things.
1) Writing analytics without getting stuck on “how”
A lot of NGOs rely on us to write dbt models for them. The MAD team knows some SQL, but like many teams, they can get stuck translating a question into models and joins.
So we opened Cursor. We talked through what they wanted to see, which tables mattered, and the logic behind it. Then we let the tool do the scaffolding. Akshay and Chetan started riffing:
“If we do this, then we should also track that. Wait, that means we’re missing this other field.” It was great—less time on building code, more time on thinking.
By the end, they weren’t just looking at a working model; they had a clearer view of their data structure, including gaps they wanted to fix. That alone was worth it. They went ahead and bought Cursor licenses and put it in their monthly budget the same day.
Not just that—Akshay and Chetan also built a few models in dbt and created some charts in just two hours. Now they’re working on the dashboard, and they reach out to me whenever they need a hand.
2) A quick, scrappy demo for charts and dashboards using Claude
I also showed them a semi-working demo I’d built in Dalgo using Claude—a small charting feature put together in about 6–8 hours. Nothing fancy, just enough to prove what’s possible quickly.
Akshay immediately started thinking about what he can build to experiment. Gaurav, a developer who joined six months ago, was eager to learn and experiment. He and Chetan wrote a short spec for a feature they wanted, and we had AI draft both backend and frontend code. Was it production-ready? Not yet. But the confidence shift was real: “We can build this. We don’t have to wait.”
Apparently they love coding now 🙂
I loved the energy everyone brought during this time. On some days, we’d sit together from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., diving into different activities. I really enjoyed how curious everyone was and how they matched my enthusiasm to get things done. Whenever I found a moment, I’d chat with Gaurav (Developer) and Chetan (PM) about how they got into MAD.
What changed for the team
Lower costs, clearer architecture.
Less waste, fewer tangles.
Faster data plumbing.
New connectors in minutes, not days.
Ownership of analytics.
With Cursor and a dbt structure they understand, they can start and iterate on their own.
Momentum on internal tools.
The quick charting demo wasn’t about charts—it was about pace. The team saw how quickly a rough idea can turn into a working thing.
What I learned from MAD
Culture matters more than most of us admit. A standup where people can say “I’m excited” and “I’m tired” out loud is a place where honest work can happen.
The right questions beat the right tools. Tools only help if the team is asking better questions.
Speed creates energy. Show something in a day, and people want to try. Ship something in a week, and people believe.
A note on Akshay and the team
It’s hard to do this kind of work while juggling a dozen other responsibilities. Akshay makes space for it. Chetan and Gaurav jumped in, learned fast, and pushed things forward. That mix—curious leadership plus hands-on builders—is why this week worked.
Why this week felt worth it
We didn’t just
make
something; we built capabilities the team can carry forward on their own. That’s what matters. If an NGO can engage with AI more effectively and draw deeper insights from its own data, it will keep growing stronger with every month.
Also, the office is in Goa. That helps.Title: A Week with Gram Vikas: Learning, Exploring, and Growing
Author: Mohd Shamoon
Date: January 2025

==================================================

In December, I started working with Gram Vikas alongside Ashwin. Initially, it involved helping with some simple tech requirements that matched my expertise. I shared ways to automate a few processes and even created an app-based solution for automating reports that were previously time-consuming.
Ashwin later suggested that we visit the Gram Vikas office to better understand their challenges and processes. So, we planned an off-site visit from 9th to 14th January, which turned out to be a memorable and enriching experience.
A Little About Gram Vikas
Gram Vikas
is a pioneering organization working to enhance the quality of life in rural communities in Orissa and Jharkhand. Their areas of focus include water and sanitation, village institutions, health, and education. With over 300 employees, they have deep-rooted connections in Odisha’s villages, driving meaningful change across multiple districts.
Their story is inspiring—beginning with a group of students from the University of Madras who arrived for cyclone relief and stayed on to empower communities in countless ways. If you have the chance, I highly recommend exploring their
journey
—it’s nothing short of amazing.
Day 1: First Impressions
On 9th January, I landed in Bhubaneswar, visiting Odisha for the first time. I was excited to experience a new place and learn something fresh. The first thing that stood out was how close the Gram Vikas office was to the airport—just 2 kilometers away. Unlike other places I’ve been to, I reached it within 10 minutes!
Odisha has its own version of ride-hailing services called Odisha Yatri, similar to Namma Yatri in Bangalore. It’s a government-run initiative ensuring fair pricing for consumers, unlike big corporations like Uber and Ola. Booking a ride was smooth, and the cab arrived quickly.
Outside of Gram Vikas office
Ashwin asked me to come to room 403, and I assumed it was a nearby hotel. But when I reached, I was surprised to find a four-story office building that looked like a hotel itself. I’ve worked with NGOs before, but this was the first time I’d seen one with such a large and professional setup. With 300 employees spread across various districts, it was much bigger than what I had imagined.
Most employees spend about 10 days a month in the field, moving between different campuses. This is why their offices also have accommodation facilities.
After arriving at the Bhubaneswar office around 1 PM, I had lunch, and then we met Alex from the PMO team. From there, we left for Mohuda, where a majority of the Gram Vikas team resides. Lucknow was cold at this time, so the warmer weather in Bhubaneswar was a welcome relief.
The 3.5-hour drive to Mohuda was peaceful. The roads passed through calm fields, small hills, and quiet villages. I recalled many people on my flight were going for the Jagannath Temple Darshan, and their chants of “Jai Jagannath” filled the air with excitement.
When we reached the Mohuda campus around 7 PM, I was amazed. The campus was huge, located right next to a village. The guest rooms were about 500 meters from the gate, surrounded by greenery. It felt less like a workplace and more like a vacation spot. After freshening up, we went to dinner at 8:30 PM.
The mess, where all employees eat together, was about 800 meters away. It reminded me of my hostel days. The food was simple and tasty. One thing that stood out was their rule to wash your own plate after eating, which I thought was a great way to instill humility.
Mess building
We spent the evening chatting with Varun about various aspects of Gram Vikas and then went to bed.
Day 2: Exploring the Campus and Processes
Ashwin and I started the day with a refreshing walk around the campus. There’s something so calming about being surrounded by trees and fresh air after living in a city. Near the guest house, we saw a vegetable farm and a weather station. On the other side of the campus, there was a dairy farm with lots of cows.
Outside of out guest house

Solar panels
After breakfast, we had a briefing session about the people we were going to meet that day. Here’s how the day went:
Water Quality Report Automation
We met Siddharth and Benstin to discuss the water quality report automation we had worked on. We shared the progress so far and explored ways to further streamline the process. Benstin explained how these reports are generated and the factors involved, which helped us understand where technology could be most effective.
Procurement and Inventory Management
Later, we met Ambika Ji to learn about the procurement process. The approval workflows were complex and time-consuming, especially during audits. We also discussed their inventory management, which is currently handled in a single master file across multiple campuses. Simplifying and automating these processes could save significant time and effort.
Photo Management and Knowledge Systems
We also talked about creating a photo management system. As Gram Vikas has been around for decades, they have a huge collection of photos. Currently, they organize them in project-level folders on Google Drive, but finding specific photos can be difficult. A tagging system could make this process much easier.
Another discussion was about setting up a knowledge management system to help new employees quickly find important documents and resources.
Day 3: The Gram Vikas School
The Gram Vikas School was the highlight of our trip. It’s a boarding school for underprivileged children, providing education from class 1 to 10. The energy of the children and the school’s atmosphere were inspiring.
We first visited the Atal Lab, where students worked on projects like Arduino cars and explored tools like 3D printers. It was amazing to see young minds experimenting with technology. We also visited the weightlifting room, where we learned about a student, Jyoshna Sabar, who had represented India and won a bronze medal at an international event. (Read more about her
here
.)

Beatiful paintings
Another stop was the art gallery, where the students’ paintings left us in awe. Ashwin and I bought four paintings as keepsakes from the trip. It was heartening to see so much talent nurtured in such a remote area.
Day 4: HR Processes and Final Discussions
We spent the final day diving into HR processes with Jyotirmaya and Devashish. The team shared details about their leave policy, where employees can choose holidays based on their preferences, like Eid, Diwali, or Christmas. They also explained how the URNA app integrates with leave management and finance.
Later, we discussed their entrepreneurship project, where data collected by Udyog Mitras is currently entered manually into Excel. They’re planning to start a pilot for an OCR-based solution to automate this process, and the overall process look promising.
Meeting the Executive Director
Thali at Dalema
Our visit ended with a meeting with Libi, Gram Vikas’ Executive Director. Over a delicious Odia thali lunch, we presented our observations and discussed ideas for improvement. Libi shared valuable insights from his experience, especially his philosophy:
“If I can ensure no harm, even if no significant change is made, my work is useful. Often, well-meaning interventions disrupt established systems. Avoiding harm itself is a contribution.”
Final Thoughts
Night at Bhubaneswar
This trip was an eye-opener. The dedication and expertise of Gram Vikas’ team members, like Varun, Thomas, and Alex, left a lasting impression. I’m looking forward to continuing this collaboration and returning in March or April. Gram Vikas is doing phenomenal work, and I feel lucky to have been a part of it, even if just for a short while.Title: A Year at Tech4Dev!!

==================================================

Laitlum Canyon, Meghalaya
, Oct 2024
I wrapped up my first year with Project Tech4Dev with the Shillong sprint in October – very much a “cherry on top” experience!
I started my journey to pivot my career in July 2022, with a checklist –
an Ideal Career Plan
(credited to career coaching at
Happen to your Career
). My decision to join Project Tech4Dev had checked most of the boxes (which boxes it didn’t check? Well you’d have to read on for that!). This was also an opportunity for me to validate if I really wanted what I think I wanted for a career. A year since I joined, as I reflect back, I answer to the question my past self put in that time capsule. Is this the career you were looking for?
Well now, I say to my past self… maybe!! A year is too short a time to judge.
I still have those couple of boxes unchecked. But the best part is that most of the things I had struck-off in my checklist while being an outsider to Project Tech4Dev, still remain checked! …and that is much more than I could ask for of an organization (and people in it) from a career pivot search.
My Checklist:
Be able to mentor and grow people – check
Being able to
Galvanize
a team – check
Learn something new – check
Work for an org whose values match with mine – check
Look up to the leadership – check (Lobo makes it look so easy and is so down to earth, that one cannot not look up (or down :P))
Have flexibility with time – check
Work remotely – check
Be able to make time for kids and travel – check (double check since I’m able to see my father more often as well)
Be able to make time for workout and stay healthy – check (double check thanks to Lobo’s fitness role modeling)
I was looking for work that would show immediate impact. This was one of the main points why I started my search with Kiva, DonorsChoose, GoFundMe and other such organizations, so I could measure the impact and know I was making a difference. My husband, Anshuman in the last 6 months started partnering with Sri G at KindKart full-time;
KindKart
helps with procuring basic necessities for small charities in India through their fundraising platform. Such tech platforms that have a direct impact, make it very easy to measure how one’s work makes lives better for others (or at least doesn’t make it worst). I’m very happy for the work they are doing, and the strides they are making. At Tech4Dev we work on open source software platforms that enable NGOs, but they don’t impact the people on the ground directly, at least not in an easily measurable way. That work is done by programs and the NGOs we support through tech. We enable those people to work smartly, efficiently! I am still struggling to justify the social impact I make through my daily work. I have these discussions at work and outside of work as well, in the hope that I can check this box for myself and see the impact. But all I can say is I’m going to put this question into a time capsule, and let my future self answer it (soon enough!).
This other one doesn’t bother me as much. But from time to time it does grow in like a thorn, and then I have to talk it out with someone, to make that unchecked box stay at bay. Both me and my husband, having worked for 20 years, I’d like to think, we as a family, would sustain for a while now. The joy of working at Tech4Dev as an org, with Lobo as a “boss”/ friend/mentor, the team as individuals and as a group, just makes the sustainability aspect diminish for me. And though this box isn’t checked yet, I think we (my family) are going to be more than fine, for now.
I’m not one of those people who is super passionate about something and plunges right into it and sticks on with it for time on end. Well, actually I do stick with things (heck, I spent 10 years at Amazon), but I’m not the one with the passion of a founder, or hard(core) worker like a CEO. Though I’m definitely that person, who a founder or CEO can rely on. You trust me with something… I will get it done! But if you don’t “trust” me enough… I may wonder if I really belong here. I like my freedom and choice to lead the way I do. I get this to some extent at Project Tech4Dev. I got a whole lot of that at Amazon (and that’s probably why I hung around). I could take risks, and learn from them, and allow my team to grow in turn. I hope to do the same at Project Tech4Dev if the space allows me to. Hoping to learn a lot in the process myself, and keep this box checked as well.
As I look forward to another year with Project Tech4Dev, it would be amiss if I didn’t look back at the year past and pin up the star moments that I thoroughly enjoyed. This past year with Tech4Dev team, has been a steep ramp up of learning and exploration. When I started my journey in pivoting my career in mid 2022, I wasn’t sure which geography I would end up working in. India was not even remotely in my mind, since it seemed unreasonable to think about working in the Indian social sector, living in the US. But Project Tech4Dev made it possible for me, and I’m immensely thankful for this opportunity.
The work I’m involved in is very similar to my responsibilities at Amazon, but so much more! I don’t get to work on the ground in Indian NGOs, but I get to support these NGOs through our work at Glific, the WhatsApp chatbot.
Last year after the sprint in Kochi, Kerala, I decided to join Project Tech4Dev full-time. I was to work partially as a fractional CxO and rest of the time head the Glific team – Engineering, Product, Biz dev and Support. As the fCxO, my first stint was with
The Aangan Trust
. Aangan is a non-profit based in Delhi, that focus on child security, mainly the girl child. I had the opportunity to visit their team in Delhi, and understand the challenges they faced. The experience was a good learning opportunity for me, in terms of understanding what basic challenges most NGOs face, not just smaller ones, but also the bigger ones like Aangan, with over 100 employees, and being around for 25 years! These challenges aren’t very technical in nature either – HR processes and tools, back office operational hygiene and so on. This was a stint I enjoyed, but it also didn’t come naturally to me. For multiple reasons with bandwidth and demand of the Glific head role, I had to gradually move out of the fractional CxO group.
The January sprint was in Goa. I got to be involved much more in planning with the Glific team. Here’s more about the
Jan sprint highlights
. I got more involved in biz dev and comms as well. which I’d not done before. I got to learn how biz dev and comms works, and I related to the counterparts I worked with at Amazon in these same functions.
Jan 2024 Goa Sprint. Team size 25
By April I had moved to Glific solely, to do justice to it. I was able to put a lot of process and mechanisms I used at Amazon, in practice at Tech4Dev in different forms for the Product and Dev teams. The bangalore sprint in April was a Tech4Dev only sprint, and it gave me special time to bond with a lot of people outside of Glific. The team had grown significantly by then.
April 2024 Bangalore sprint. Team size 28.
The July sprint in Delhi was the first one with only Glific team. We executed on our accelerator, the first of its kind, and biggest so far in terms of bringing NGOs together. I was so proud of the team is pulling this through.
In October, I wrapped up my first year. My 5th Sprint was in Meghalaya!! I got the opportunity to plan it. It was such fun collaborating with high spirited Pratiksha and Priyesh who had joined Tech4Dev recently, as well as Ashwin, who facilitates open-ended session with such ease. The sprint was one of its kind. I enjoyed planning for it, and loved the energy at the hackathon as well as outdoor walks and talks.
First day at Shillong sprint, Oct 2024. Outdoor circle time. Team size 34
What I Love about my work:
The team is very passionate about their work and goals
The culture is transparent, flexible, open to critical feedback, and quite different than most social orgs in India.
I get to meet passionate social sector founders and CEOs in US tagging along with Lobo, and expand my view of things.
Get to connect Lobo and Sanjeev who are so full of information wealth. Always learn something new when I meet them.
I am able to stay connected with India.
Learn more about how the govt and non-govt orgs exist together and function in India.
What I would like change/ make progress towards:
Bring in processes and mechanisms that improve hiring, career growth, mentoring as the org grows
Knowing and showing impact: like to have data I can find myself.
Not staying up at night too late. Figuring this one out on how I can support my own circadian rhythm and health. Its not at its best right now.
Sustenance for my family.
Traveling every quarter with kids. Taking at least half of the summer off work to travel with them.
My wishlist started with people at work and wandered into my daily life and into my family life. These are the things that are my focus as well (corporate or social sector). Looking forward to 2025 in meeting these and more goals that stay nascent in the corner of mind for now.

Date: December 2024
Category: Fractional CxO

==================================================

2024 was a year of significant growth and transformation for Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO (fCxO) Program, but beyond the numbers and milestones, it was a year full of stories, challenges, and learning. For the fCxOs, this journey is not just about technology or strategy—it’s about relationships, building trust, and the collective effort to make a difference for the NGOs we engage with.
The program, which started as a pilot in 2022, has always been driven by a deep commitment to bridging the gap between NGOs and the technical expertise they need to thrive. Over the years, it has evolved into something far more meaningful—a partnership that goes beyond implementing tools or creating systems. It’s about empowering NGOs to embrace technology as a catalyst for change, not just an operational necessity.
The Heart of 2024: Growth and Evolution
This year, the Fractional CxO Program expanded its reach significantly, working with 14 NGOs across diverse sectors. Each partnership brought its own unique challenges and opportunities, and each one reinforced the program’s mission: to use technology to amplify the incredible work NGOs do every day.
The team itself grew stronger, welcoming new members Antony, Devi, and Shamoon, whose fresh perspectives and energy added to the group’s collective expertise. The introduction of the Fractional Tech Team model—a pairing of senior fCxOs with developers, Technical Product/Project Managers—allowed for a deeper focus on both strategic guidance and hands-on implementation.
But this growth wasn’t just about numbers or new models; it was about the relationships that were built along the way. The fCxOs worked closely with NGO leaders, navigating the complexities of organizational change, building trust, and helping them see the potential that technology could unlock.
Stories of Impact
Behind every engagement is a story of persistence, innovation, and transformation. The vignettes below illustrate the breadth and depth of the work in some of the engagements:

, we embarked not on a journey of complete digital transformation across the organisation but aiming towards technology adoption and enabling a trusting data culture to empower more efficient and effective day to day operations and in turn helping SHOFCO substantiate the impact of their work. We started small with the Gender Program and plan to build on the success of this into Education, Health and Sustainable Livelihoods in early 2025.
CMHLP:
At CMHLP, their flagship program, Atmiyata, has streamlined its forms for improved performance and ease of use, and is embarking on integrating Dalgo to enhance data processing and visualization. This upgrade supports the program’s expansion into new regions. Meanwhile, the ENGAGE program has transitioned to REDCap and the Outlive program simplified their app architecture, automated workflows, transitioning to better-suited vendors with clear processes, well-defined requirements for greater efficiency.
Vasudha Foundation
improved their data management processes and launched multiple projects with government partnerships. In alignment with program requirements, a tech upskilling plan for program teams to better plan and manage software projects was implemented. Finally, a full-time CTO was hired and onboarded towards the end of the year to continue implementing the technology roadmap laid out by the fCxO along with the Vasudha team.
SEEDS
made large strides in discovering and refining the requirements of the national loss platform they are building. Pilots testing disaster loss analysis via multi-modal self-reporting by communities impacted by climate change were run in multiple states. Ecosystem events were held to brainstorm, collaborate and align on key learnings and next steps stemming from the pilots and the early design of the national loss platform.
SEARCH
launched a mental health chatbot to make mental health services more accessible in underserved regions, breaking barriers to care for communities in need. This was a new experiment for us with a fCxO spending 40 hrs a week at the same organisation. Being full-time has helped us move things faster and maybe a possible model for us to experiment more on in 2025 of concentrated full time work for a shorter time at one organisation.
Sarva Mangal Family Trust:
Their flagship project: Project Chashma transitioned to a digital platform, reducing manual errors and streamlining operations to ensure better vision care for more patients.
These are a few examples of our work from 2024, but they only tell part of the story. The true impact lies in the confidence these NGOs have gained—the confidence to think through technology decisions, to innovate, and to embrace technology as a key enabler of their mission.
Our Experiments this Year
Tech4Impact
:
We had our first Tech4Impact event in Bangalore in April with tech experts in the sector represented across funders, NGOs and technical software partners. This was our attempt towards filling the gap on peer networking for social sector tech leaders who occupy a very lonesome space in most of these organisations. We continued this with multiple webinars and have found partners such as Social Bytes to move this forward so we have organic participation and leadership of this space across the sector.  Though the initial in-person event was very successful, the online webinar presence in general has been underwhelming. We are hoping to kickstart this a bit in 2025 and really push this along with an in-person event again in April/May 2025 and then evaluate the viability of this experiment.
Fractional Tech Team:
An experiment this year from our learnings the previous year to expand beyond just a Fractional CxO but provide support in terms of developers, product/project managers, data engineers/scientists to help speed up proof of concepts, quick fixes, additional help on training and upskilling areas. With this in mind we have run a few projects including
Janaagraha
where we have been working significantly on improving the internal developer team’s experience, efficiency and upskilling the team on those aspects,
SNEHA where we have been working as product managers to help in a chatbot strategy on Glific to enable and empower women in their 10000 days of motherhood journey,
Dasra where we have been working as Technical Project Managers to bridge the gap on business requirements to technical requirements and ensuring that the Salesforce vendor and internal Dasra teams are in sync on a stakeholder management system implementation.
The Challenges Along the Way
2024 was no exception to having a few whiffs.
On the NGO-facing  side we faced challenges such as resistance to change from some NGO leaders, delays in hiring critical roles, and the ever-present struggle of ensuring that solutions are sustainable in the long term. These challenges weren’t roadblocks; they were opportunities to learn and grow. The fCxOs discovered that early and consistent engagement with leadership was essential to overcoming resistance. They learned that sustainability isn’t just about handing over tools—it’s about building the capacity and confidence of the people who use them.
On the internal side, we grapple as always with maintaining the balance between supply and demand of the service. Fluctuating demand from NGOs partly dictated by focus and priorities and also by budgets has been tough to estimate leading to difficulties in the hiring end and longer timelines to start of engagement. A consistent pipeline and managing the ebbs and flows of demand feels like will be quite a challenge even in 2025.
Also as a self-reflection among fCxOs, we feel that we could be providing a better service and value for money to NGOs (even though NGOs on their ends have been happy and consistently have given as NPS scores of over 60). Better process, reviews, documentation, peer learning and cross leveraging of work across fCxOs  are some areas that we definitely want to focus on to improve in 2025.
Looking Ahead to 2025
A simple but a long list to look forward to:
Continued engagement and managing quality with our engagements
Helping leverage work better amongst our fCxOs to help newer engagements and also the ecosystem
Structuring and increasing the scale of the Fractional Tech Team model and in turn empowering more non-profits with the fCxO team model.
More Tech4Impact events – in person and online to maintain the community engagement
Chai Pe Charcha (our new sprint standard of meeting with NGOs in the cities we have our quarterly meetups, listening to the challenges of the NGOs and fCxOs working as pro-bono advisors for the day in working more deeply with a few fo the NGOs on that day) events
Another exciting experiment we will be kick-starting early next year will be in helping empower and enable grassroots orgs through technology (a segment typically we @Tech4Dev have not typically worked with). We are planning to have 5 orgs in and around  Chennai from Dasra’s Rebuild Fund cohort in our initial pilot experiment. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting new experiment in the next quarterly report.Title: A data driven approach to curb the zombie that is 66A

==================================================

The
Internet Freedom Foundation
(IFF) has over the past year conducted a broad range of work, including original research, approaching the supreme court and citizen engagement to stop the menace of Section 66A. IFF, which works with an objective to protect our digital rights, is now taking yet another step, with support from
CivicDataLab
and
Tech4Dev
to reach closer to our common goal of stopping 66A. This time through a data-driven approach.
What is 66A ?
As per
IndiaCode
(a repository of all Central and State acts), Section 66A of the Information Technology act is defined as the
?Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, etc.?
Section 66A was
declared unconstitutional
in the year 2015 by the Supreme Court in
Shreya Singhal v. Union of india
. Owing to its subjective nature and the vagueness of its definition, the court marked an end to this act, which was inserted through an amendment act in 2008 and criminalised sending ?offensive messages? online.
March 2020, will mark the fifth anniversary since the judgement came out, but one can still see the prevalence of this law and the harsh criminal rigours it is responsible for. Not only is this unjust, cruel but it is also unconstitutional.
People are not only being arrested across the country but it feels like the pillars of our justice system are not yet aware of the unconstitutionality of this act. There have been legal efforts by organisations such as the
IFF
and
PUCL
to deal with this problem of ?
signal failure
?
. In their latest attempt (2019) they approached the Supreme Court of India which directed copies of its judgement in Shreya Singhal to be sent to every High Court, District Courts, Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police. We hope that the copies were distributed, and this will make at-least a few more, if not all, aware of this zombie.
There were more than
2000
arrests under section 66A in 2014 alone and though the arrests seem to be declining over time, Section 66-A continues a ghostly afterlife in police stations and courts across India. Only about
two weeks back
the Karnataka High Court imposed costs on police officers for a prosecution under Section 66A.
Where are the numbers – Who/Where/How are they suffering?
The
NCRB
, which is responsible for collection and publication of data pertaining to crime in India, has stopped publishing the numbers under 66A since 2016. The net result is that we lack an authoritative figure for the number of arrests under Section 66-A and also that the government eliminated a data point for checking the continued forays of this legal zombie. To search for such cases, one can go to the police stations and search through FIR’s as there is no single database in the country today that tracks the arrests under this section.
What can we do about this?
A slightly feasible and a digital way to collect this information is by searching through the cases filed at the district courts in the country. The district courts database is maintained through an online platform called
eCourts
and this opens a door for us to mine information around cases that are registered within this act. In this 6 month collaboration, between the Internet Freedom Foundation and CivicDataLab, our objective is to create a dataset at the level of a
district court
with detailed information around 66A.
Data collection and reporting strategy
To test a few initial hypotheses on data availability and the feasibility of this exercise, we plan to collect data from a few states, selected as per the presence of cyber crime reported through NCRB, with a slightly diverse geographic spread. These are:
Uttar Pradesh
Telangana
Rajasthan
Maharashtra
Assam
Andhra Pradesh
Jharkhand
The data from these states will be collected from
Jan, 2008 – Feb, 2020
.
The fight to stop the reporting under section 66A has been a long one, and looking for indicators that help us visualise the impact around the several measures taken up by the community is really important to move ahead in this journey. In the initial phase, we shall report the numbers around a few crucial milestones (or categories) in this case.
Category I
: Cases registered post Shreya Singhal judgment (March 24, 2015) under 66A.
Category II
: Cases having multiple sections and is still active and cases having multiple sections that have been disposed.
Category III
: Cases registered post February 15, 2019 (
this is when the Supreme Court of India had directed that copies of the Shreya Singhal judgement should be sent to High Courts, District Courts, Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police.
) till February 15, 2020.
Category IV
: Cases that have convicted individuals under 66A post 2015.
What it takes to report activity around 66A – Building a data platform
We have identified a few crucial components required to curate this dataset:
A data mining pipeline
– To fetch data from the
eCourts district courts database
.
Data anonymization toolkit
– Creating a framework to deal with sensitive information that is part of the case-law like
petitioners name
,
victim details
, etc. This will also ensure that such details are redacted from any public view but may be utilised in future advocacy that may be necessary for immediate remedial action in these specific cases.
A data validation process
– Measures to report accurate statistics around 66A.
Research and Analysis
– On creating anecdotal and quantitative evidence on the presence and impact of 66A.
An Editorial component
– To create a larger framework for ensuring
?How case data can help alongside ideal public policy approach to deal with the perils of an unconstitutional law?.
How will this process help?
Insights from a curated dataset at the district level will help us in further strategising our efforts around information sharing, especially with the ones who are most affected, providing legal aid and identifying places with the highest level of signal failures. This might also help and assist us to sensitise the judiciary in these directions and will also enable us to:
Track the pendency of cases registered under this section.
Drive evidence-based advocacy through qualitative and quantitative research which can provide inferences to the use of an unconstitutional provision for criminal prosecution.
Enable better citizen engagement with the institutions of governance.
Spread awareness around the use of unconstitutional provisions and how they should not be used to prosecute people.
Engage communities through the platform to ensure that individuals are made conscious of their rights.
The importance of this project
This is an experiment, one that can create important pieces of missing information. The various components, methodologies and the processes shall be designed with an intent of reproducibility and hence will empower and promote more empirical research and analysis of our laws. The curated datasets will focus on a detailed district level analysis of the case-laws and will add on to the existing datasets released by the NCRB.
Keep checking the space for updates around this project. We hope to create a
sustained
,
validated
and a
useful
dataset that can act as a mirror for visualising 66A and in the process generate interest, awareness and curate experiential learning to trace and tackle the existence and lingering use of unconstitutional laws.
The larger ambition of this project goes beyond Section 66A to any provision which has been ruled as unconstitutional and making sure that data oriented approaches are used.
We’re grateful to the Chintu Gudiya foundation that has agreed to support this initiative through their Tech4Dev grant towards CivicDataLab, and with this help, we shall strive hard to create open and public resources for the community for a sustained collaboration

==================================================

In most IT workplaces, there is a significant gender imbalance even though given the correct leadership, flexibility, and understanding, a woman has the capacity to thrive in any role she takes on. The lack of an inclusive ecosystem that promotes women to flourish in their chosen area is one of the problems hindering women’s advancement in the IT industry, and most of it originates from gender bias.
This problem needs to be corrected from its root by creating a space where women at the graduate level can start off on the right foot, acquire skills essential for the professional world, work with industry experts and gain hands-on experience with technology in order to close the gap between what is taught at college and what the industry actually requires.
Backstory:
We at
ColoredCow
are likewise concerned about the gender gap in the tech industry and want to address it. Lobo expressed his thoughts and why there is a need to develop an ecosystem that addresses the gender gap in the IT business during the November
Social Impact Sprint
at Tehri, and we found common ground with him.
In the next few weeks, we met
HyperVerge Academy
(HVA) which also works in a similar domain to enable young people to learn software development and secure well-paying jobs in the tech industry.
Kickstarting the Women in Tech Fellowship
In collaboration with
Tech4dev
and HyperVerge on January 13, 2022, We Kickstarted the
Women in Tech Fellowship
program from ColoredCows Incubation office in THDC Institute of Hydropower Engineering and Technology.
The induction session went well and was quite interactive, with 26 young fellows from
THDC IHET
joining us with a strong desire to learn more and the ambition to contribute to the tech community
Over the next few weeks, HyperVerge and ColoredCow conducted interviews shortlisted 21 candidates, who were then divided into four groups.
To facilitate the fellows’ overall progress, these groups were overseen by two mentors: a tech mentor from ColoredCow and a power skills mentor from HyperVerge.
Check out Gayathri’s
blog
covering her view on kickstarting fellowship.
Reflecting last month
It’s been over a month since the fellowship program began, and it’s been a wonderful experience with these passionate and enthusiastic fellows, seeing their progress each week, listening to their doubts in daily standups, the clarity of questions they ask, and the efforts they put certainly bring enthusiasm in mentors as well. Being a mentor, myself, I felt that the motivation of folks heightened mine too.
In addition to daily standup in the last month, we had two fortnightly FSD review calls where we consolidate two-week progress and reflect back on what went well and how we can improve. These review calls also give mentees the opportunity to present their work with the group, share the challenges they faced and how they overcome them.
Though being a  mentor, I share feedback whenever needed but through review calls, it helps to reflect back two weeks of progress and share feedback on overall progress. I see it benefits both mentors and mentees since they help both visualize the broad picture and understand each mentee’s strengths and areas to improve on in the coming weeks.
The Sky is the limit…
As weeks keep progressing I see tremendous growth as these young women are taking the charge by leading daily standups, completing weekly milestones, writing weekly
blogs
, and helping one another in moving ahead together which truly are early signs of success in achieving what we set out to do
We are very hopeful for the upcoming months of the program
and excited to be a part of this journey with the WIT fellows to mold many more women tech leaders and create a diverse tech world.
Looking forward to being part of many more initiatives for the public goodTitle: A peek into the Women in Tech Fellowship through our Learners

==================================================

The article is written by the Plio team(Aman, Karn, Deepansh). Originally posed
here
.
You know how so many people have been taking full advantage of remote working by working from very exotic-looking places? Yeah, we haven’t been like those people.
Until last week. We got a chance to travel to Tehri (Uttarakhand, India) where multiple organisations working at the intersection of technology and social impact had assembled for a week-long sprint.
New Tehri is a modern town developed at the hilltop, spread over an altitude from 1550-1950 metres above sea level overlooking the gigantic Tehri lake and the Tehri dam. Every morning, we woke up to an amalgamation of the lake, mountains, clouds, chirping birds, a troop of rafters and the clingiest of dogs in our wooden huts.
View from our rooms
We have to be honest. It was really hard to get ourselves out of our bed. But the fact that the entire day had so many exciting things planned got us going (along with the fact that if we didnt board the last cab at 8:45, we’d have to walk for 90 minutes to reach the workspace).
Our daily workspace was the office of ColoredCow – the lead organiser and facilitator of the entire sprint. Yes, they have an office in the hills. No, it did not happen due to the recent surge in remote working. The team is comprised of several members, including the founder, born and brought up in the hills. So, they figured why not just work out of the hills too. They even have all sorts of instruments in their office. Let that sink in!
The cool office set up consisting of instruments and a green screen
And you could always spot one person playing the role of barista for their group!
The buzz around the coffee machine
Each team brought food and sweets representative of where they are coming from!
Sweets brought by various team members
To cap it all off, we were treated with a variety of super delicious and healthy home-cooked food by the cooks in the house!
Delicious home-cooked food being prepared
Okay, we did do some work too! 😛
Each day started off with a technical talk given by 2 organisations. We got to hear about the amazing and important work that each organisation has been doing. Some of the examples include:
Glific: an open-source, two-way communication platform for NGOs to connect with their beneficiaries
Dost Education: promotes early-childhood development by providing actionable steps to parents through short, friendly audio content using IVR
Aam Digital: an open-source tool to enable high-quality case management for the social sector
IDInsight: uses data and evidence to help decision-makers design effective programs and rigorously test what works to support communities
Our talk probably didnt qualify to be called technical because it was full of one thing: memes. But we did make a few people laugh while sharing the story of how the three of us have come together over the last year to build open-source products for helping students from low-income backgrounds learn better. This is how we began our talk.
If you are interested, you can view the slides
here
and let us know what you thought about it! ????
The tech talks were followed by people working with their teams as usual. It was like being a part of a co-working space along with mission-driven people. The energy in the room used to be quite infectious and I am really missing it now!
In the evening, some of us used to go for mini-hikes of about 5-6 km. It reminded us that we are amidst the beauty of the hills and we were, once again, breath-taken by the miracle that we usually call nature.
The view of the Tehri lake during one of our evening hikes
The work part of each day used to typically end with a deep dive on one particular topic presented by one of the teams. Some of the topics included: Data Studio and Big Query, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and offline-first, Highly-Scalable NLP to Answer Questions on South Africas COVID-19 WhatsApp Hotline. We gave a talk on AI for Social Good where Aman shared his learnings from his experience at Wadhwani AI (prior to Plio & Avanti Fellows).

.
Once the work part of the day was over, the entire workspace would transform. On one of the days, we had a StoryClub session – its an
initiative
by the ColoredCow team to encourage their team members to share a story about their journey – personal or professional. I personally feel that this is a great initiative as storytelling is such an important skill that we are rarely taught and because of the fact that we, as humans, love stories as a medium to connect with each other. You can check out all their stories on their
YouTube channel
. Deepansh and I got a chance to share some of our stories too!
A glimpse from the storytelling night organised by ColoredCow
On our final day, the entire group went for an 11-km trek. It was my first time trekking with such a large group and I think many of us came out as good friends towards the end of it. We even saw some snowy peaks and cherry blossoms along the way!
Left: snowy peaks during our trek on the final day. Right: cherry blossoms during the same trek
To bring a close to the sprint for us, we had a night with a bonfire, lots of stories, music, lighting and amazing food from none other than Prakash Ji from the earlier photo!
One of the few moments when the entire group was together.
We had one of the most memorable trips where we made a lot of new friends, had amazing conversations and learnt about the different journeys of every person. It was fundamentally very inspiring to see so many smart and passionate people working towards using their skills to improve the world. I am a strong believer in the power of communities and if anything, this trip simply reinforced that belief.
Logos of all the organisations which made the sprint happen
As I write this, I really do miss being around everyone and am already looking forward to the next time that this group gets together. Deepansh, Karn and I rarely get a chance to spend time together and this trip increased our own personal bond. We got a chance to spend a lot of time with Donald Lobo, the founder of the Chintu Gudiya Foundation. Lobo has been our mentor for some time now but meeting him in person, hearing his thoughts on everything from open-source to his concern and optimism towards climate change to ideas on how we can increase woman participation in the intersection of tech + social impact and seeing his enthusiasm for healthy living has deeply affected all of us. I still remember how we were a bit nervous before giving our meme-filled presentation when everyone else was talking about deeply technical things. But everyone in the sprint accepted and appreciated us for all our quirks. We will always remember how everyone made us feel!

==================================================

Sitting in my hotel room, overlooking Wilson Airport and recovering from the last 5 days of working with different groups across the country. The first 4 days were spent with 12 amazing NGOs across Africa and our partners: The Agency Fund and Dasra at Lake Naivasha. You can read more details about this sprint in the blog posts by
Krishna Priya
and
Siddanth
(yes, it’s great to see people write about their experiences without prompting!).
We followed the sprint with an unconference event in Nairobi with new partners:
Kuja Link
– Dawit,
East African Philanthropy Network
– Mathilda, Global Giving and
Lets Create Africa
– Wahigi. This event was organized at fairly short notice since we wanted to optimize our time in Africa, and we are glad we stumbled into these partners. We pulled off an amazing conference in a span of 4 weeks with all of us trusting the group to give it their best shot. For me personally, this event was inspiring, eye-opening, a bit sad but gave us a dose of reality on the ecosystem in Kenya and East Africa.
The organizing team for the Nairobi Unconference
I learned a lot of things about the NGO/CBO (Community Based Organizations) ecosystem and a couple of new phrases/concepts when talking to two young women (Suzanne and Elema) after the event yesterday. The first phrase was “NGO economy” – i.e. where some parts of the country is run by NGOs and/or with NGO money. People find it easier to stop work (i.e. farming) and instead prefer to be the recipient of donor dollars. The second surprising thing was the number of CBOs across the ecosystem. We had quite a few participants from CBOs at the event who are doing work in various parts of the country, many of them formed by young women based on their experiences and their desire and passion to make it better for the next generation. The third thing which was surprising was the number of teenage pregnancies in Kenya (15% currently down from 19% 4 years ago) compared to 4% (urban india) to 8% (rural india). Had a fascinating conversation with the two young women about reasons for this, which are rooted in sociocultural, economic and environmental factors. Seems like lots of reading material out there on this for me to catch up on!
Some random meandering thoughts on the two events
Our core mission of building a strong and thriving tech+data ecosystem is as relevant to Kenya (and by extension East Africa / Africa) as it is to India. Lots of similarities with the two countries and I suspect our work can be used effectively out here also.
Magic happens when we put people in a room and let the conversations flow. We saw this both at Naivasha with the Agency Fund grantees and in Nairobi with a wide assortment of organizations with different budgets and personnel. Most of the in-depth discussions happened outside the sessions and it was great to see people interacting and being deeply engaged
Stories are powerful. Personal stories are even more powerful. Stories with data are the best 🙂 These sessions had the most interest at the Nairobi unconference.
Unconferences are awesome and we should do more of them. It’s important for people to be engaged, have a voice and participate in the discussions. This was quite nice to see at both Naivasha and Nairobi
Trust based collaboration works so so well. Both the events were collaborative efforts by different parties, and things went quite well. The parties had different agendas for what they wanted to get out of the convening, but all of us were focussed on the same larger goal: Community building, Peer Learning, Broader Exposure
There are lots of amazing orgs across the world doing such amazing work. Loved our interactions with Shujaaz (both at Naivasha and at their Nairobi office), hanging out with the people from Noora Health and Saajha, learning more about Educate!, SameSame and Kabakoo.
By far, the most important discussion I had, was the data conversation with Richard and Jamie. At Tech4Dev, we believe and enforce open source tech in everything we do and have the buy-in from all our NGO partners. However, on data our policy so far has been: “Its the data of the NGO, they own the rights to it, and we (i.e. the platform provider) does not access it”. However, I think we might need to take a step back and think about data a wee bit more. Can we draft a sharing agreement, where the NGO still retains all the rights and ownership of the data, but we can access it selectively (and with permission for each access) for “research” purposes. As an e.g., if we have this, we can define protocols to measure the completion rate for each NGOs chatbot program. We can potentially run some experiments across the platform that give us better insights into things like engagement rate, response rate etc.
We need to push all NGOs and partners to open source early and everything. We saw a fair bit of work at the sprints, which we would have loved to use and build on, BUT was not yet open. Personally, I believe that if you start off building things in the open from the very beginning in a collaborative manner, we can accomplish a lot more. For example, our
Glific + WhatsApp groups
came to fruition from a grant by Agency Fund to Avanti Fellows, who in turn agreed to let us build it on Glific in an open source way. We now have 5 other NGOs, including Shujaaz, who are super keen on using it for their needs. Power of community and open source
Travel is tiring, and I seem to have a perpetual cough. All of us are aging (I was hoping to age a bit slower) , but someone from our team (here’s looking at you Krishna Priya), mentioned in a very casual way when I was trying to book some train tickets, that I should use my “SENIOR CITIZEN” status and take advantage of my old age ???? . I’m old, but not that old KP ????. I did have to remind the group that I initiated most of the walks and could bike up the hill at Hell’s gate while all the young ones were walking their bikes. The joys of being surrounded by youth and having an open and transparent culture. ARGH!
As always, I’m always inspired by the work the NGOs do. My biggest takeaway is, there is so much opportunities for us in East Africa and beyond, that we need to seize the moment now, and JUST DO IT.
Headed to Mumbai for the
Dasra Philantrophy Week 2024
events and looking forward to meeting another set of amazing NGOs and partners

Author: Donald Lobo
Date: March 2025
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/a-trip-through-time-and-space-a-tech4dev-adventure-across-india/
==================================================

Another few weeks, and I’m back in India. Temina tells me I should be worried about radiation from so much flying, will need to research it. But I do feel I’m living life to its fullest and enjoying spending time with our ecosystem partners, our team in India, our funders and our close friends and partners like Dasra and The Agency Fund. I feel that every trip is amazing, and it cannot get better, but the next trip is always better, I meet more folks who inspire me and I see the ecosystem grow and prosper, and visit a few new places in India.
This trip followed the same pattern as my recent trips. Too much travel, a lot of in depth conversations with multiple folks, and multiple Dasra events for the 26th edition of Dasra Philanthropy Week, then followed it with the AI For Global Development (AI4GD) Sprint hosted by Tech4Dev and Agency Fund.
So, without further ado, here are a few highlights and lowlights from the trip and the ecosystem in general
Highlights
We decided to invite a few funders and ecosystem partners to the AI4GD sprint to showcase the amazing work our NGOs are doing and to give them a sense of where we see things are going. To our delight, we had an amazing response and had approx 35 folks join us for a day of conversations, insights and explorations in what we can do with AI and LLMs. The good thing about this gathering was our initial set of speakers were quite moderate in what they thought AI could potentially accomplish for the sector and gave a really balanced viewpoint. The biggest takeaway for many of the folks: There are a lot of real things that we could do with AI/LLMs today that can scale and are potentially quite impactful (more rigorous studies need to be done here)
We wound up the funder day with a closed door session with the funders and some partners. Our combined call to action were:
We need to educate the broader funder ecosystem who were not in the room. We’ll organize an event in April/May and invite a lot more folks.
Funders need to invest in the infrastructure that can get initiatives like AI4GD to move at a faster pace. This includes funding strong technical teams, open source collaboration, additional in-person gatherings and more.
The other two days of the sprint were a whirlwind of talks from multiple NGOs, a lot of working sessions and more. However the most important aspect of this and similar events is the relationships that we build and the knowledge that is shared. From a Tech4Dev perspective, we seem to find some of the common problems that we can solve for the sector and incorporate it into our upcoming platforms.
DPW started off with an event in Bangalore with some focus on Data and AI. My main talking points at most of these sessions are always anchored by
We need to listen carefully and understand what the NGOs want to solve. Good to ask questions and understand the problem first before offering solutions.
While open source is important, for most / all NGOs it is a don’t care. It is more important that their problem is solved in a reliable and relatively affordable manner rather than insisting on everything being open source. From my perspective, it is important that if we fund software development using philanthropic/public money, the output should be open source to allow everyone else to learn from it.
Collaboration seems to be the buzzword for the past few years, but we first need to publish and share our learnings so others can benefit. It also means we need to learn from what others have shared. To me, thats an important step before collaboration
As with other similar events, the main purpose of these events is the networking and meeting folks that we might not have crossed paths with. DPW in Bangalore and Mumbai proved quite valuable in that aspect
Erica
and
Vinod
will have their own blogs that talks about their perspective on the AF sprint and the DPW events which are linked here 🙂
Takeaways – AI4GD Funder Day
From my collaborator and partner-in-crime for funder day, Sasha Tanghe, some key takeaways and actions items from the discussions on that day are:
AI must be measured by outcomes, not just capabilities
—the focus should be on real impact (e.g., improving literacy, nutrition), not just technical performance.
AI is most effective when applied to specific mechanisms
— It’s an enabler to proven interventions. For example, can supercharge interventions by automating personal tutoring, entrepreneurship coaching, or digital extension services.
Investment in public goods and ecosystem-building is critical
—beyond isolated pilots, we need shared infrastructure, open-source models, and long-term collaboration.
Funders are eager for
more experimentation and flexible funding
—AI demands a “safe-to-fail” mindset.
Misses
From a tech perspective, Tech4Dev is a pure platform play. As such all our platforms build basic infrastructure that can be used by 100’s of NGOs across the world, to build their programs on. We continue to struggle with grant proposals even from organizations who know and recommend their NGOs to use our work. At the same time, we see a lot of wasted money and effort on NGOs rebuilding similar things to meet the grants objectives. This scenario is being repeated as we see more AI grant proposals and is a bit disheartening
We need to convince funders that if we rely on ecosystem players to stitch things together, we need to fund the ecosystem players also. The AI4GD funder gathering was our pitch to showcase this point. If we want collaboration to happen and public goods  to be developed and used, lets fund the groups that make it happen
While we’ll always have a few bumps along the way, I’m more convinced than ever that we are headed in the right direction with the right group of people on the team. Exciting times ahead
After a long and tiring week in India, Mari and I packed our bags and hiking shoes and headed to Bhutan. Spending a bit more than 10 days there and writing this blog from a nice homestay in Bumthang, Bhutan @ 9000 ft. It’s been a great trip so far with 15km+ hikes on most days. Managed to meet an NGO leader in Bhutan and learned that Bhutan as 54 NGOs across the country. Its population is also less than a million to put things in perspective.

==================================================

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to transform the development sector. Yet, many nonprofit organizations face a critical gap—while there’s growing conversation about what AI is, there’s far less clarity on how to practically apply it to solve real-world challenges.
To bridge this gap, we at Project Tech4Dev, along with The Agency Fund, are excited to launch the pilot edition of the AI Cohort Program. This program aims at building capacity and providing hands-on support designed to help NGOs design, build, and scale responsible AI solutions. Tech4Dev is interested in incorporating many of these patterns into our open source AI platform that is being developed.
Why an AI Cohort?
AI is no longer a distant future, whether it’s automating data-heavy processes or enhancing frontline service delivery, AI can dramatically improve efficiency. Leveraging AI responsibly, with the needed guardrails can unlock a lot of bandwidth and potential for non profits.
This program is designed on our learning from running the AI for Global Development Cohort. Additionally, we have also collated insights from partners like the Digital Futures Lab and Digital Green. We have experienced the need for structured support that blends hands-on mentoring with an ethical AI framework.
What the Program Offers
The AI Cohort Program is designed to equip NGOs with:
A working AI solution aligned to a real-world program need
Dedicated mentoring for use-case validation and prototyping
Training on responsible AI practices and safety protocols
A roadmap to integrate the solution into ongoing operations
Peer learning and in-person workshops to strengthen cross-sector collaboration
From student assessments and personalized learning to chatbots for frontline workers—illustrative use cases already point to the transformative potential of AI in the nonprofit space.
Who Should Apply?
We are selecting 7 NGOs through an application process. The ideal candidates will:
Dedicate resources who are comfortable exploring and experimenting with technology, data, and AI tools
Be committed to co-developing and piloting an AI use case
Be ready to align leadership and allocate internal resources for experimentation and learning
Willingness to contribute your problem and solution under an open source license.
No advanced AI expertise is needed—just a clear use case, openness to learning, and commitment to innovation.
The Learning Journey
The program will be kicked off in the first week of July and will follow a blended learning model:
A virtual orientation and foundational sessions on AI for impact
Regular one-on-one mentoring over 3 months
A 2-day in-person meeting in Bangalore and 2-day conclusion and demo day at the end of the cohort
The program is expected to start in mid August with a few virtual sessions and conclude by December with the final in-person meeting and demo day.
Program Support
Participation in the program is free of cost. The tuition, stay, and meals for the in-person meet will be covered for the participants. Travel expenses are to be covered by the participating organizations.

Author: Nishika Yadav
Date: May 2025

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/ai-platform-building-steadily-khopoli-sprint-reflections/
==================================================

It’s been three months since a small team started building the AI platform, and it’s been rewarding to watch the pieces slowly come together into something that people can use – read more about what we’ve accomplished so far
here
.
Seeing the work move from ideas to implementation has been motivating for the entire team. On a personal note, this period has been a significant learning experience for me. When we began, I found software development—especially backend work—quite intimidating. But by consistently working on the platform, I’ve started to feel more comfortable with backend concepts and workflows. This has helped me overcome some of the hesitation I had initially.
This was the AI team’s second sprint. To learn more about the previous one, check out our
earlier blog post
.
Sprint Experience
This sprint came at a particularly useful time. We were able to finalize the migration of the Glific AI code to the platform, which was a key milestone. At the same time, we wrapped up the solution document outlining how we’ll approach the Dalgo code migration next. Both of these were major tasks that helped clarify our direction. Additionally, we spent time discussing and agreeing on the platform’s roadmap, which gave everyone a clearer picture of the next steps and priorities. The momentum from this sprint has set a strong foundation for the upcoming work.
Of the three sprints I’ve attended so far, this one felt the most interactive and engaging. The facilitators made the sessions more hands-on by encouraging us to express our ideas creatively on chart paper, which added a fun, visual element to the discussions. One standout session was on design thinking, where we were introduced to a structured approach to problem-solving. We explored techniques like reverse brainstorming and the six thinking hats to analyze problems from different perspectives and generate solutions.
Another session I found particularly impactful was a collaborative, gamified team simulation. In this activity, participants stepped into the roles of organizational or vertical leads and were asked to navigate complex, real-world scenarios through strategic decision-making. The simulation presented challenges like scaling sales or launching new products, while introducing unexpected events—such as sudden funding shifts or rapid team expansion—that pushed us to think critically and adapt.
Overall roadmap discussion
We welcomed a new team member, Vijay, last week. He’ll split his time between AI Platform and his FCXO work. We met him briefly during our standups last week, but connecting in person during the sprint brought a whole new energy. Vijay brings over 20 years of experience in tech and entrepreneurship, and he’s easy to talk to as the conversations flowed naturally. Looking forward to collaborating more closely in the coming months!
During this sprint, Akhilesh, Lobo, and Vijay met to align on our roadmap and quarterly goals, helping set the direction for the AI Platform:
Short-Term Goals
The team focused on several immediate priorities:
Glific Migration
was completed, including support for running threads and endpoint authentication.
Dalgo Migration
is underway, with work progressing on planning for the full workflow.
Multi-Tenancy Support
and
Document Management
tasks are in early stages, including reviews and platform integration.
Efforts are ongoing to
streamline deployment
, involving cleanup tasks, Terraform scripts, and finalizing deployment processes.
Other initiatives include
security and monitoring checks
.
Mid-Term Goals
Work is being scoped for:
Evaluation Integration
, with plans to move past work into the platform.
Langfuse Integration
, which is also in the pipeline and being reviewed.
Long-Term Goals
Looking ahead, the team is considering:
LiteLLM Integration
for AI provider flexibility, though this may be deferred since OpenAI remains the primary provider.
Jerome moving forward
For over a year, Jerome has been working with us part-time at Tech4Dev, helping steer our direction towards AI. He’s been key in setting up an evaluation framework based on how NGOs currently use our products. He also gave an excellent presentation at the Agency Fund sprint, sparking lots of new ideas.
You can check out his presentation here:
Building Robust LLM Interaction Pipelines
Jerome will be moving on in a few weeks, having accepted a full-time position with the World Bank. In the sprint we discussed his work so far and things worth including in our AI platform. Luckily, he’ll still be around, so we look forward to catching up and benefiting from his advice on AI!
Infra Review
As part of our ongoing infrastructure review, Akhilesh, Vijay, and Kurund met to evaluate our current deployment setup, focusing on how we manage automated deployments to both staging and production environments. This includes the use of AWS ECS for container orchestration and Terraform for infrastructure as code. The discussion aimed to identify areas for simplification, better reliability, and alignment with best practices.
Given that we are also developing the Shashakt platform in parallel, there is a conscious effort to standardize the workflows, environment structure, and deployment strategies across both platforms. This will reduce overhead, streamline onboarding for contributors, and make long-term maintenance more manageable.
Looking ahead, we plan to analyze infrastructure costs from the past month, with a particular focus on ECS usage, data transfer, and storage. The goal is to use these insights to optimize resource allocation and ensure our setup remains cost-effective as the platform scales.
Overall
The past few weeks have been a period of steady progress, learning, and thoughtful planning for the AI Platform team. From completing major milestones like the Glific migration to mapping out long-term goals and strengthening our infrastructure, the sprint gave us the opportunity to align technically and strategically.
Welcoming new team members and preparing for transitions, like Jerome’s move, also reminded us of the importance of knowledge-sharing and continuity. We’re building this platform gradually, with a clear focus on doing things right—not just fast. As we scale both the team and the product, we’ll continue to focus on building strong foundations, one step at a time.Title: AI Project Kickoff

==================================================

This new year has brought fresh beginnings in many ways. Each of our projects—Glific, Dalgo, fcxo, and Avni—is growing quickly, and our team is expanding too. This growth reassures us that we’re heading in the right direction and gives us confidence to take new initiatives. After quite a bit of planning, we’ve officially put together a team and kicked off our very own AI platform.
Briefly, we will be building a platform that makes it easy for our products (like Glific, Dalgo, and Avni), or any other NGO platforms, to integrate AI models through a straightforward API. Our platform acts as a simple layer that manages communication with AI providers like OpenAI, ensuring our products remain flexible, focused, and efficient. While at the same time, NGOs need not to rely on any product to
This blog is the trailhead—the first of many to come—marking the beginning of a long journey for our AI platform. Over the past few months, we’ve made significant strides. Although discussions and whiteboard planning have been ongoing, actual development began in February, and we’ve made great progress since then.

Accomplishments so far
We’ve had a lot of feature requests from different platforms and NGO usecases, plus a long wish list of our own. To keep things focused, we’ve locked v1.0 around a single goal: move the existing AI implementation from Glific and Dalgo onto our new platform. Once that migration is solid, we’ll revisit the roadmap and slot in the next wave of ideas.

Author: Mohd Shamoon
Date: June 2025
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/ai-use-cases-in-ngos-fir-data-extraction/
==================================================

This is a common challenge faced by many NGOs. They often receive a large volume of PDFs and image documents that need to be manually processed for data entry. This task is usually assigned to interns or done by volunteers, which often results in inaccuracies and errors in data and facts.
One such example comes from our work with an NGO focused on FIR (First Information Report) extraction. The NGO receives numerous FIRs in PDF and image formats and needs to extract 32 key data points to generate actionable insights. These data points typically include:
The accident location
Types of vehicles involved
Fatalities and other details
Such information can be used to pinpoint accident hotspots, identify common negligence factors, and help in policy-making.
In an FIR, accident location details are typically found in the summary, stating phrases like “2km north of the police station” or “on this particular road,” which can then be mapped in Google Maps.
However, the manual extraction process was labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the lack of cross-verification.
The traditional process involved:
Extracting and entering data into an Excel sheet, organized by district.
Generating heatmaps and insights in QGIS based on the data.
Presenting findings, such as fatalities, in Google Slides for the government.
While this method worked to some extent, it had significant limitations, including:
Difficulty in comparing data across districts or at the national level.
The need for centralization and streamlining.
Solution: Centralizing the Data System
Our first recommendation was to centralize the data management system. We chose the
Frappe framework
because it met our requirements:
Easy form creation
Automatic import and export functionality
Robust filtering and reporting capabilities
By moving all Excel data into a centralized database, we simplified access and created the foundation for a real-time dashboard, which was previously a challenge due to the fragmented data sources.
Leveraging AI for Data Extraction
The next challenge was automating the extraction of key data points from the FIRs. The team initially used
Pytesseract
for PDF and image-to-text conversion, coupled with regular expressions (regex) to extract data based on FIR formats. However, this approach had several drawbacks:
Pytesseract had low accuracy, especially with image-based FIRs.
The regex logic had to be customized for each state’s FIR format and language, leading to complexity and errors.
AI-Powered Approach
We proposed an AI-driven approach to automate and improve the accuracy of data extraction. The solution involves the following steps:
A user uploads a folder containing FIR PDFs.
The PDFs are added to a queue for processing.
Each FIR is processed using
OpenAI’s Vision model
to convert the image/PDF into a markdown (MD) file, which worked well for most of the FIRs.
The 32 key points are then extracted using another
OpenAI model (GPT-4o)
, generating a structured JSON output.
This JSON data is sent to the
Frappe database
for viewing and reporting.
Frappe workflow
Cost and Efficiency
At the time of the experiment (April 2025), the cost per PDF file (around 5-6 pages) was:
Vision model: $0.01 per PDF
OpenAI processing: $0.02 per PDF
This results in a total of
$0.03 per PDF
or
₹2.6
.
For an estimated
10,000 PDFs
, the total cost would be
₹26,000
, significantly reducing the time spent by employees (which could take months).
We also considered implementing an agentic verification system for accuracy which is to be taken later after manual verification.
Privacy concerns regarding citizen data led us to abandon using OpenAI for the idea. OpenAI’s privacy policy assured no data usage for training, but we still opted for a more secure solution.
Hosting an Open-Source LLM Model
To address privacy concerns, we decided to host an
open-source LLM model
. This approach had its own set of challenges but offered greater control over the data. Here are the key components of our setup:
Marker-PDF
: We used
Marker
(an open-source tool) to convert PDFs to markdown format. After evaluating several options, we found
Marker
to be the most accurate and user-friendly.
Marker GUI to test on local
Ollama and Open WebUI
: For processing the extracted data, we used
Ollama
(an open-source LLM interface) alongside
Open WebUI
for easy interaction with the models.
Open web UI to test local models using ollama
Infrastructure and Costs
To run the models efficiently, we provisioned a
GPU machine
on AWS. Here’s a summary of the machines used:
g5.2xlarge
: $1.212 per hour
g5.4xlarge
: $1.624 per hour
g5.16xlarge
: $4.096 per hour
g5.24xlarge
: $8.144 per hour
We moved from a
g5.2xlarge
machine to a
g5.16xlarge
machine due to the need for faster processing.
The Process
After provisioning the hardware and software, I integrated everything into a
FastAPI app
. The workflow includes:
Uploading the FIR PDFs to
Frappe
.
Converting PDFs to markdown using
Marker
.
Using
Ollama
to process the markdown and extract the 32 key points into a structured JSON format.
Storing the data in
Frappe
and exporting it for reporting.
During testing, I processed
135 FIR files
, and it took about
3.5 hours
to summarize everything.
Evaluation and Next Steps
We used
Langfuse
to track input/output tokens and evaluate processing time. After the data was processed and stored in Frappe, it was exported to a Google Sheet for accuracy verification. The feedback was positive, though more adjustments are needed for large-scale use.
Langfuse for llm model evaluation
Costs for the Pilot
The
cost per FIR
was around
₹18-20
, and while this is higher than expected, we aim to optimize the process during the next phase.

Author: Donald Lobo
Date: April 2025
Category: AI
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/ai-for-social-impact-summit-highlights-from-bengaluru/
==================================================

This year has been a super productive year for us from an ecosystem and collaboration perspective. We just wrapped up an AI for Social Impact Summit in Bengaluru on Apr 25th at Atlassian’s offices. We had approximately 20 CSR folks attend from Bengaluru and beyond, along with 4 consulting groups and a small group of 3 NGOs presenting their work on AI
The genesis of this event came about during the
Funder Day at the AI For Global Development Sprint
, when
Sumit Tayal
, the CEO of Give remarked that a similar event would be super useful to the CSR community of funders also.
Harshith Muppuri
from Atlassian Foundation also chipped in saying he would love to do something similar. It made sense for us to group together and organize a small event for the CSR folks. Along the way we also felt it was good to include the consulting ecosystem players (Bridgespan, Dahlberg, Sattva and Dasra), since it was the logical thing to do to 🙂
While all of us had interacted briefly with each other, we had not worked together or even knew each other well before the event. This being the social sector, the trust between all of us seemed implicit and quite strong from the very beginning and this helped a lot in making the event happen. We split up responsibilities very early on: Sumit would try to get folks from the CSR community to the event, Harshith would help with this and also coordinate the logistics of the event, and Tech4Dev would help with the agenda and design the content and bring in the speakers.
The obligatory post event group photo 🙂
From a community perspective, we wanted the spotlight to be on some of our amazing NGO partners who’ve been experimenting and piloting solutions with AI and LLMs. After a few conversations we decided on
Aman Dalmia from
Hyperverge Academy
to talk about his work on
Sens AI
Kuldeep D from Reap Benefit on how they are using Data and AI at scale to engage with the youth to solve hyperlocal problems
Anand G from The Apprentice Project to demonstrate how they are using tech and AI to reach students at scale and to give better feedback on assignments
Jerome White from Project Tech4Dev to talk in depth about what it means to build from the sector with an engineering mindset
We started off the event, with Pratiksha Rao from Project Tech4Dev talking about some interesting use cases where AI has been very useful and not so useful. In a random turn of events, we had the author, Nick Otis,  of one of
our case studies
at the event, so it was great to see have the experience of someone who has experimented on the field with GenAI to be present.
Overall, I do think the event was a solid success. It was relatively easy to organize with a group of people chipping in with their expertise quite nicely. The time spent organizing and coordinating the event was quite minimal and the group worked efficiently and smoothly. From a networking perspective, exposure to the work the social sector does with regard to AI and the conversations that happened, it was an incredible investment. I’m always amazed and thankful to be part of this group of folks who are so kind and generous with their times. Events like thise help us see the bigger picture of the work we are doing and why

Dasra
As data and technology practitioners in the social impact sector, we often connect among ourselves to share experiences of how the introduction of new tech (read AI) affects us with hype cycles, funding gaps, standardization approaches, unintended consequences, and much more, in unique ways. We deeply admire the work that the CSO leaders and tech builders who understand AI application across forms and impact use-cases, are doing in crucial thematic areas like education, climate, youth-action, governance, and more. And, we feel committed to the importance of supporting these initiatives, the urgency of demystifying tech use cases, and the responsibility of making it more accessible.
What’s better than getting together to enhance the discussion ourselves. We believe the rest of the path opens up organically even if gradually. With that in mind, collaborators across a few leading organizations came together to organize a half-day event on AI for Social Impact, in Bangalore on 25th April.
The genesis of the idea came from the
AI for Global Development Sprint
by  ProjectTech4Dev and Agency Fund earlier this year, where leaders from Give.do and Atlassian Foundation shared their interest in conducting a learning and engagement session for CSR and Funder community in India. With their leadership in mobilizing reach-outs, sponsorship, and content, the session felt seamless. We at Dasra made a few contributions from our philanthropic networks and insights and were grateful to engage with the forum across AI driven CSOs, CSR funders, as well as partners, helping the case of adopting AI in horizontally scalable, impact centric, and responsible manner, forward.
The event was curated with the intent of going a step deeper into discussing the
transformation potential of AI with real use cases, the avenues of supporting AI investment, while staying true to the pragmatism of the development sector and CSO experiences. 20+ Philanthropic leaders attended and engaged in active discussions with both CSOs and Partner orgs to explore what they could do in their portfolio programs or extend support to new initiatives.
It was inspiring to see NGOs’ impact experiences with AI, and validate some of the learnings we’d seen previously in impact, technology, and social psychology. The growth potential is undeniable and the India development sector has been steadily making early strides in establishing working frameworks and responsible use. Sharing a few insights (non-exhaustive list) I carry from the day
Multi stakeholder engagements are not just good to have, they are the way to go for successful deployments
– Kunji, a pilot project aiding IAS officers via a whatsapp enabled chatbot (Glific) to augment informational capacity was made successful through close collaboration of 3 stakeholders working closely together- Veddis managing the working with rural development office, Spectra scaffolding the grassroot NGO work, and Project Tech4Dev providing the tech behind the chatbot
Scalability loves a modular approach
– There’s too much to do for us to risk duplication of efforts. Building tech that is transferable to other NGOs is the way to go and both Reap Benefit and Project Tech4Dev are doing that really well.
Learning happens by sitting
through difficult problems
– Hyperverge’s sens.ai demonstrated how well trained AI can patiently nudge students to resist the urge of jumping into finding the right answer; and encourage them to pause and review any mistakes they were making in the steps of solving a difficult problem. Something we all can do more of, at any age!
Thriving through equity-
a case study from Ghana showed us how AI based math tutoring levelled the playing field for girls and helped them do better in a system where they were underperforming due to low expectations of their tutors. AI when used judiciously can help us reduce unintended bias and uncover true potential.
A gathering where committed leaders come together to discuss avenues of partnering for effective innovation in the impact sector has to be energizing on any given day, and this one absolutely was! Thank you Lobo, Erica, Sumit, Harshith, for making us a part of it, and Jerome, Pratiksha, Anand, Kuldeep, Aman for sharing your experiences with the group.As a committed partner, Dasra looks forward to continuing our advisory discussion with funders and augment their journey of supporting NGOs in leveraging AI for greater impact on communities.Title: ASHWINI CHP App Enhancements Complete and Live

Highlight of the Project : Self Serviceability
A key highlight of this project for us was that we involved the IT team from ASHWINI to do the development. They developed forms using the then
newly released App designer of Avni
. As part of the form creation, they were able to add the skip logic rules, validation checks and visit scheduling rules with the help of some examples provided by us. They also developed reports by writing SQL queries. The work was tested by us thoroughly before making it available on production.
This was the first time an IT person from an NGO was using the App designer. This worked as a pilot and test for self-serviceability for such a use-case. It turned out to be a successful one and we gained good insights and feedback from it too.
Go Live
A couple of weeks back the co-ordinators team of ASHWINI provided training to health animators on using the expanded version of the app. The health animators have now started to use the app on the field.
Thanks to Kannan, Jiji, Roshina, Dhanya and complete ASHWINI team for this collaborative effort and an opportunity to work on this.
What next?
Now that ASHWINI has 2 full-fledged systems running – one in the hospital using Bahmni and another in the community using Avni, their vision is to be able to see the data from two systems as complete records as well as at aggregate levels. This will facilitate better service delivery and research. As part of a separate project, we would soon be starting the development of an integration middleware between the two systems.Title: Aam Digital

Aam Digital
is an easy-to-use case management software for the social sector that empowers field workers in their in-person interactions with participants. Having simple, reliable documentation helps improve the effectiveness and transparency of projects.
For example, Aam Digital helps social workers and teachers of an education support programme to easily manage all information about students development, attendance and health. That way staff can spend time working with people rather than doing paperwork, while the tool helps them collaborate and keep an overview of progress and critical cases. This data also helps them evaluate the impact of their activities and show achievements to their donors. [

==================================================

Introduction:
In our approach to enhance the
DevDataPlatform
we aimed to seamlessly integrate
Apache Superset’s
data dashboards within an embedded iframe. However, users would encounter multiple login prompts, which disrupt their experience. To address this challenge and provide a smoother data exploration process, we found a solution that ensures users to explore data insights without any login interruptions.
In this blog, we’ll explain the process of achieving a seamless login experience for Superset within the embedded user-specific iframe, and also delve into the challenge we faced during the implementation.
1. Superset Integration with IFrames
Let’s walk through the step-by-step process of achieving a seamless login experience for Superset within the embedded iframe.
To make the most of Superset capabilities within our web app, we embedded Superset’s data dashboards within an iframe on our web pages. Think of an iframe as a window within a window, allowing us to seamlessly display external content, such as Superset’s visualizations, within our app.
With the embedded iframe in place, we established smooth communication between the main web page (parent window) and the embedded iframe. When the iframe sends a specific message, such as “hello from iframe,” the parent window responds with “hello from parent.” This communication helps us coordinate actions between the web page and the embedded content.
2. Achieving Seamless Superset Login
To achieve a seamless login experience for users accessing Superset within the iframe. Here’s the step-by-step process:
Enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): We set ENABLE_CORS to True in the Superset configuration. This enables Superset to share resources across different origins and allows our web app to communicate with Superset.
Configuring CORS Options: We defined CORS_OPTIONS to specify the necessary configurations for CORS support.
Setting ‘supports_credentials’: True enables credentials, and we allow specific headers, including ‘X-CSRFToken’, ‘Content-Type’, ‘Origin’, and ‘Authorization’. These headers are crucial for maintaining authentication and communication between the web app and Superset.
Enabling Embedded Superset Feature: By setting SUPERSET_FEATURE_EMBEDDED_SUPERSET to True, we activate the feature that allows seamless integration of Superset within IFrames.
We use the existing login function, which sends the user credentials for       supersets security login endpoint.
Superset responds with an “access_token,” indicating a successful login.
We then retrieve access_token, we make a request to fetch CSRF token to its endpoint and access the csrf_token
Using the “access_token” and csrf_token, we initiate a login request with the username and password.
If the login is successful, users can explore Superset’s data dashboards within the iframe without needing to log in again.
3. Challenge Faced: Maintaining User Authentication
The main challenge we encountered was ensuring users don’t face login issues when accessing Superset within the iframe. The Same-Origin Policy enforced by browsers restricts cross-origin requests by default, and this posed a hurdle in maintaining the user’s authentication status within the iframe.
4. Solution: The ‘credentials: include Option
To overcome the authentication challenge, we incorporated the ‘credentials: include’ option in our Fetch API requests. By including this option, we ensure that authentication information (such as cookies and tokens) is sent along with the request, even for cross-origin requests. This is essential for maintaining the user’s logged-in state and accessing protected resources on another domain, like Superset’s API.
Conclusion
By overcoming the challenge of maintaining user authentication with the ‘credentials: include’ option and implementing the existing login function, we achieved a seamless login experience for users accessing Superset within the DevDataPlatform Eliminating redundant login prompts significantly improved the user experience, enabling effortless data exploration.Title: Adopting AI in the Social Sector: Highlights from collaborative Sprint

==================================================

As we step into the new year 2025, we are kicking things off with a bang by organizing a sprint at Chariot Beach Resorts, Mahabalipuram, Chennai. This was a great way to start the year by spending in-person time with many NGOs, understanding the impactful work they do, and supporting them along the way. It reaffirms our commitment to the social sector and sets a strong foundation for the year ahead. The sprint was divided into two parts: the first week focused on the
AVNI
,
Dalgo
, and
FCXOs
groups, while the second week was dedicated to the AI and
Glific
teams. This split was necessary as our team continues to grow, and inviting NGOs from all product groups at the same time would be overwhelming. By structuring it this way, we were able to ensure more meaningful interactions and deeper engagement with each group, making the sprint more productive and impactful.

Dalgo Sprint In Mahabalipuram
Exploring Dalgo with SocialBytes: A Conversation on Tech-Driven Impact
Kickoff Sprint
For the AI sprint, we arrived on January 27th and met most of the team—Lobo, Jerome, Akhilesh, and Nishika. The first few days were all about figuring out our priorities for the next few months and what it’ll take to get v1.0 out the door. We spent a lot of time piecing things together—talking through the modules we need to build, the high-level architecture, and the APIs required to migrate existing NGOs. The goal was simple: make the most of our in-person time to map everything out so that once we’re back, we can start knocking things off the list.
We kicked off the NGO sessions in the second half of January 29th, inviting four NGOs—
The Apprentice Project(TAP)
,
SEARCH
,
Digital Green
, and
Veddis
. Each came from a different sector, bringing their own use cases and approaches they are taking to integrate AI into their programs. We started with an opening circle, setting the tone for the sprint— the idea was to understand the amazing work each of us is doing, learn from each other’s mistakes, and explore areas of collaboration. After that, we dove into our learning from Kunji Bot and
SEARCH
’s use case but more on this later.  We concluded the day with an
insightful session
by Jerome on the LLM work we’ve been doing at Tech4Dev.
Digital Green use case
During the sprint, Rajsekar from
Digital Green
introduced
Farmer.Cha
t, an AI-powered assistant designed to support Extension Agents (EAs) and small-scale farmers. This chatbot enables EAs to manage tasks, log feedback, and retrieve advisory content efficiently. Farmers and EAs can interact with the chatbot using text, images, or videos to ask questions. For instance, a farmer could upload a photo of a crop and inquire about the best fertilization methods. Currently, the bot serves farmers in India and Kenya.
The chatbot is powered by OpenAI’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for retrieving relevant responses. To further enhance accuracy, Digital Green uses their own fine-tuned LLaMA model to evaluate responses. The model was fine-tuned using
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
and is deployed via
Hugging Face
for efficient inference.
To reduce cost and latency, Digital Green implemented query caching and similarity search within their chatbot system. Instead of processing each query independently, the system aggregates the user’s current query with their most recent queries, forming a contextualized input.
This aggregated query is then sent to a
vector database
, which performs semantic similarity search to retrieve historically similar queries. The corresponding answers from these similar queries are extracted and incorporated into the response generation process. This approach reduces redundant computation and minimizes API calls to expensive LLMs.
SEARCH
Anto shared with us about
SEARCH
(Society for Education, Action, and Research in Community Health) which is an NGO founded in 1987, known for its pioneering work in public and neonatal health.
Their project, Tobacco Face, explores whether AI-generated projections of a person’s face—showing the long-term effects of tobacco use—can help reduce consumption. The idea is simple: if people see how tobacco will age and damage their own faces, it might hit harder than just statistics or warnings.
They’re testing this in Gadchiroli, where tobacco use starts young. By making the risks personal and visual, they hope to drive real change.
TAP use case
Himani and Nithun talked about how
The Apprentice Project(TAP)
, is combining AI with a CRM tool to streamline student assignment submissions. TAP works in education, helping underprivileged students build essential 21st-century skills. They’ve been using
Glific
for their chatbot program,
TAP Buddy
, to offer personalized learning and support across India.
During the sprint, they showcased a use case where AI helps evaluate student assignments. It’s a two-step process: first, when a student submits an assignment, it gets logged in the LMS (Frappe), and related details—like student info and assignment data—are pulled. Then, the submission goes through a plagiarism check to see if the same image has been uploaded before. If it passes, AI analyzes the assignment, generates feedback, and assigns a grade. The feedback is sent to the student via WhatsApp, while other data is stored in the LMS for future reference and analysis.
Here’s a high level workflow of their tool
evalix.ai
:
Veddis use case
For
Veddis
, we had already been working on their
public policy bot, Kunji
, which enables government officials to ask policy-related questions. We demonstrated the
use case and solution
we developed for Kunji and showcased our work to other NGOs. Additionally, we provided a hands-on experience, allowing participants to test the bot themselves. You can read more about our solution
here
.
The chatbot provides human-like, multilingual responses in Hindi and English, along with voice-based interactions through speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities. It also offers direct access to policy documents. Future enhancements include Google Sheets integration for easy query analysis, AI-LLM integration for real-time policy-based responses, advanced analytics to track user engagement, and automated nudges for timely updates and reminders.
Furthermore, we got to know about
Sashakt
, which is a digital assessment tool developed to help Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) under DAY-NRLM evaluate stakeholder expertise, identify knowledge gaps, and drive data-driven training interventions. Supported by
Veddis Foundation
, Sashakt accelerates the impact of
HSRLM
initiatives by enabling
need-based training programs
and improving grassroots decision-making.
Closing notes
The goal of this sprint was as simple as learning from each other as much as possible. The AI Cohort served as a collaborative knowledge-sharing space, bringing together organizations actively leveraging AI for social impact. Each participant showcased their use cases, implementation strategies, and success metrics, fostering a dynamic exchange of insights.
It was a great chance to work together, see the bigger picture, and explore how these ideas could help other NGOs in the same space. Our team also gained valuable technical and strategic learning . In the closing circle, we went around the table, sharing experiences, expectations and what we want to focus on in the coming months. We’ll be meeting  again in March for The Agency Fund Sprint, where this group—along with many more NGOs—will come together to share learning and more vivid use cases.Title: Adventures in Kochi: Learning, Food, and Fun

==================================================

Our Kochi journey, an exciting quest,
To learn and explore, we gave our best.
As our hearts danced with pure delight,
Ready for adventures, under day and night.
Our journey to Kochi for another sprint was filled with excitement and anticipation as we looked forward to learning something new and creating memorable experiences
During this trip, we mainly focused on two new things: the Data Catalyst Program (DCP) and Open LLm. These programs had the potential to teach us new things and broaden our horizons.
What made our trip even more special was the chance to meet and chat with new people. We had some great conversations and learned different perspectives from them. Our time in Kochi was about learning and connecting with new folks(also have some fun).
The mix of exploring, gaining knowledge, and meeting interesting people made this trip a truly enjoyable and memorable experience.
Data catalyst Program(DCP)
A cohort based approach to help NGOs use, manage, process and analyze data. We also did not know enough about the subject matter to run this cohort by ourselves. So, we invited some of our ecosystem partners: Dasra, GoalKeep and Agency Fund to help us design and run this cohort. Our current model of the program is:
Spend the first month learning more about the NGOs data systems via the Data Culture Quiz, some deep dive pre-work, followed by a 60-90 min deep dive call. We will then allocate 2 team members to each NGO to help them over the next 3 months in their data management.
Open LLM
We began with a project called Jugalbandi, which was a good way for NGOs to start using ChatGPT and explore generative AI from their perspective. It allowed them to try it out on a small scale, see if they like it, and understand if it suits their needs.
As we made more progress and talked to other NGOs, we discovered some really cool features of GPT. These include making the AI do certain tasks and remembering what was said earlier in the conversation to provide better answers. These are precisely the things many NGOs were looking for. So, we decided to create our own project called LLM, and Agency Fund has been a big support in this journey.
This project is all about making Glific interactions even better. We want to use OpenAI’s Language Model to help Glific chatbots give really smart and accurate answers. To do this, we’ll create a separate place within the Glific system where all this special knowledge will be stored. It won’t be mixed up with everything else. We’ll connect it to Glific using a special link called a webhook, so the chatbot can provide even smarter responses based on the specific situation.
In the first two days, we focused on the Data Catalyst Program (DCP) . The session with the Dasra folks was incredibly enjoyable and enriching(we also learned some new dancing moves). For the rest of the time, we delved into the Open LLM and Glific. This time, not all Glific users were present, only those who were interested in Open LLM and wanted to use it in their projects.
Aside from the work, we also got to enjoy some delicious Kerala food and traditional dishes.
While we were there, we took morning walks and got to enjoy the stunning beauty of Kerala. The greenery and peaceful atmosphere made these walks special. We also tried some Japanese snacks there.
It’s always enjoyable to spend time with the team, have fun, learn new things together, and grow together as a team.Title: Advice for the grant application and interview process

==================================================

We are just starting the second round interview process for Project Tech4Dev. Based on a couple of conversations and the applications we received, I wanted to list a few things that we want all applicants to hopefully read and at least do a few or most of them. We do think that the below is definitely part of most of the successful applications in our first cohort.
Be on time. This applies to application deadlines, online calls, and email requests. While we do try and send reminders, we cannot do this all the time.
For online applications, please read, understand and answer the specific question. Ask for clarification if needed. Submit detailed answers so that someone not affiliated with your organization can understand your response. We?ve never had an issue with people giving us too much information. On the other hand at least 20% of our applications have given us too little information.
For online meetings, make sure the right people are on the call. If you need to reschedule, please do so. Don?t expect to have a second call to account for people missing the first call.
For online meetings, make sure you have a good internet connection you know how to connect, have the necessary software, and a headset.
If the time and dates are not convenient, let us know. We understand people have other obligations. We are responsive and happy to choose a time that works for all of us.
Be prepared. Do your homework. Read and think about potential answers to the questions we?ve shared publicly
here
Ask us questions anytime. If some things are not clear either on the application or in our documents, send us a
mail
. Send us a reminder if you don?t get a response soon. In general we do try and respond within 24 hours.
Be prepared to talk about your organization?s mission, vision and impact. Have a grasp of the financials of your organization.
Have a good idea of  how your organization makes a difference. Be prepared with a few data points of where your organization has been effective and how it has made change
We spend a fair bit of time prepping for the call. So, we do expect the people we are talking to also spend a fair bit of time and energy prepping on their side. We want to hear your story and ensure we are productive in the process
Let us know your thoughts, comments and feedback. Send us

Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/agamishaala-2023-a-beautiful-journey-of-self-reflection-and-systemic-change/
==================================================

When I made the decision to attend Agamishaala 2023, I knew I was embarking on a journey into the unknown, guided more by my trust in the Agami team who was organizing the event. The venue for the Shaala was nestled amidst the serene hills of Ranikhet, the location was just perfect for introspection and growth. Over the course of four days, I discovered new aspects of my personality and learned valuable lessons about collaboration, systems thinking, and self-reflection.
As I entered the gathering of close to 25 individuals, primarily from the law and justice space, I questioned how I, representing a technology-focused organization in the social sector, could contribute to this group. With minimal exposure to law and justice, I felt a sense of uncertainty. However, I decided to embrace the process wholeheartedly, recognising the potential for self development and contributing to the group to the best of my knowledge and capacity.
The journey began with introspection, shifting focus from the mind to the body through the 20-minute Body Dance session. During this exercise, I relinquished control to my body, allowing it to guide my movements instead of my mind. This simple act of surrender revealed a deeper truth  that the mind often governs the body, but when the roles reversed temporarily both my body and mind experienced a sense of liberation. This introspection offered valuable insights into collaboration, highlighting the significance of giving up control and allowing others to contribute in their own unique ways
Next, we transitioned from the individual self to the collective social body in a group exercise. In groups of four and then five, without speaking, we simply observed and acknowledged each other’s actions, roles and the dynamics that emerged. Through this exercise, I gained awareness of my personality traits, the power of empathy and understanding in building connections and fostering collaboration.
One particularly impactful session was the 3D modeling exercise done on the third day which encouraged me to think beyond my individual boundary. As change-makers, to achieve our collective vision for the sector, sustainable and scalable change must encompass the entire system. This realization marked a pivotal moment for me, I understood the importance of thinking and acting at a systems level.
Under the guidance of our facilitator, Manish, we delved into the power of listening and the significance of silence. The space between listening and reacting, where silence prevails, allows for the birth of new insights and deeper understanding. This realization highlighted the transformative potential of active listening and a receptive mindset when trying to understand.
A pivotal moment for me was the fresh perspective I gained on the age old saying, “To know where the shoe pinches, you need to get into those shoes.” The added insight from taking off your own shoes before getting into others emphasized the importance of removing our own biases and preconceptions before truly stepping into someone else’s shoes. This fresh start enables us to approach situations with a willingness to understand without judgement and empathy.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Agami team for ideating something like the Shaala and organising it with such perfection. The sessions provided such invaluable insights for me.
As I reflect on the four days I spent with my fellow Shaalaites’23, I am filled with a renewed sense of purpose and determination to contribute to the sector meaningful.
Wishing the team at AgamiShaala – Sachin, Supriya, Artika, Aditi and Manish the very best for future Shaalas.

By Edmund Korley
DALLE 3 Prompt: Photo of an Airport: A bustling scene at the Kochi International Airport in Kerala, India. Sunlight filters through the large glass windows, casting a warm hue over the floor. Travelers of diverse descent and gender are seen with luggage, some looking at the flight information displays, while others are seated, waiting for their flights. Palm trees are visible outside, hinting at the tropical location.
The Tech4Dev sprint and the Data Catalyst and LLM convening marked several first-time experiences for me. It was my first international trip in my role at the
Agency Fund
, an evidence-driven philanthropy. This was also my initial interaction with the
Tech4Dev
sprint, coupled with my first ever visit to Asia, specifically India. Following a long journey over multiple continents that lasted more than 24 hours from Atlanta, USA, via JFK and Abu Dhabi, I finally touched down at the Kochi International Airport in Kerala, India. A mishap led me to the wrong Marriott hotel during a sojourn of over an hour before I finally made it to the correct one, surviving on mere airplane sleep but eagerly anticipating the conference and the opportunity to meet everyone.
On my day of arrival, I immediately dived into some pair programming time with Akhilesh from the Glific team on
glific/Open-LLM
. Tech4Dev has an existing integration with ChatGPT via
Jugalbandi
. With Open-LLM we are aiming to build upon the existing Jugalbandi integration by having more control of the ChatGPT API. It supports existing Jugalbandi features such as adding custom knowledge bases (pdfs, txt, markdown text files in English) backed by
pgvector
for tailored answers and content generation. It additionally supports incorporating personalized system prompts for effective experimentations and safe boundaries, enabling the use of different GPT models as accessible through Open AI APIs, maintaining a conversation history per session for more contextual responses, supporting voice note queries and generating answers, and an option for automatic/manual rating of the response quality and accuracy. We are in the developer era of generative AI and it’s very exciting. Shoutout to Ishan from the Dalgo team who contributed some
key improvements
for the long-term maintainability of the repo. Look out for a separate announcement on this integration soon.
Day one of the Data Catalyst agenda focused on data storytelling and building a data mindset. The session included presentations from each NGO on their data stories, followed by discussions and interactions among peers. The agenda also covered topics such as crafting a data vision, developing an action plan, and understanding data quality, security, and access. Day two focused on various aspects of data use and leadership. I would present
my LLM talk
on responsible applications of LLMs. The talk focused on the use cases and guidelines for exploratory data analysis using ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis feature. It included a live demo where we used LLM agents to catalog, summarize, and visualize a demo dataset of Indian foods. We also created a predictive model in ChatGPT to estimate the flavor profile of an Indian dish based on a list of ingredients. The talk emphasized the ability to explore complex data questions without requiring technical expertise, which was very relevant to this Data Catalyst NGO audience.
After Data Catalyst wrapped up, the 2-day CISCO sponsored LLM meetup started right after. The gathering was an offline event aimed at bridging NGOs interested in LLM/AI technologies together. The intent was to deepen their understanding of the technology by offering expert speeches and displays of related work. Over the two days, from the night of the 18th to the evening of the 20th, there was a mix of sharing visions, experiments, lessons learnt, and identifying future needs via NGO presentations. The first day centered around NGOs like TAP, Myna Mahila, Bandhu, Udhyam, and Quest Alliance presenting themselves and their LLM use-case. The second day was kicked off with
a great talk
by Aman Dalmia at HyperVerge Academy followed-up with collaborative work sessions for drafting prototypes and plotting out NGO strategies around LLMs.
My trip to India for the Tech4Dev sprint was an eye-opener. It was my first time in Asia, and it was filled with new experiences, from travel mix-ups to exciting tech and data sessions with NGOs doing amazing work. I had a blast working with some smart and passionate people, and we shared ideas on how to use these new tech tools for good causes. As I return home, I’m excited about what the future holds and look forward to more such trips. Here’s to learning, growing, and working together for a better world!Title: Aligning design with product goals

==================================================

When we started with Glific, we had a bunch of feature ideas in mind and a goal to achieve for the NGO end users. As is the case with all products. It was about solving a challenge, our users being the non-profits. There was not much form to that goal in the beginning, just a waving flag of the mission. We knew the process we were going to take through the journey. And that is the thing about building products with veterans and experienced team members that we believe in a process and are confident that through it, we’ll reach the end goal.
The afterthought
The design process at the start can feel abstract and perplexing. That could be one of the reasons why design is an afterthought for many products. A few other reasons for that could be:
There’s a vision that the product should be a thing of beauty and it would work really smoothly, right from day one. This can add a lot of pressure and give a sense of misdirection if the real goal is really to push out features and get users to begin using the app.
And yet, the initial design phase can still be straightforward because it’s about starting with a blank canvas. When more features get added, the product starts becoming complex, if a separate strategic design thought isn’t added too.
The tech team is empathetic towards the users and is adept at the initial design part which is mostly about capturing workflows as requirements.
The process
With Glific we started really organically and with a good balance of design right from the beginning. While the tech team experimented with the tech stack, exploring the capabilities and prototyping how aligned available tech can be with the use cases, the design team focused on understanding the challenges of the users and generating insights for the features. Design focus was mostly on documenting the details that would feed into the product.
While the expectation from design was to have great looking screens, the design process itself in the beginning was quite ugly. Which is how any process of creation is. At the start we even resorted to verbal communication of how the layout would be. The discussions would go something like “let’s have a navigation at the top and a sidebar and main chat panel in the middle…” It definitely helped in moving forward rather than feeling stuck with what to do. A lot of times designers also feel stuck at this phase because the perfect thing isn’t in sight. Design is supposed to be the process of clearing abstraction not for the designers to be engulfed in it. And the process is to take small steps that make things clearer for the design and the rest of the team.
A set of wireframes at the early stage helped us with a visual reference for all the documented requirements. It was crucial for the front end team to have a reference to get started and for the design team to build into detailed workflows.
This gave time to both front-end and design teams to experiment. The front end team used the Material UI framework to create the features initially. It showed us great progress.
Moving from wireframes to actual UI is also a big jump for the design team. And much more than the tactical jump, it was psychological. There’s always an ambition to create their magnum opus. But there’s also the hanging urgency to keep the team moving forward, and to have a unique look and feel too for the market positioning. While we didn’t have a ton of market research for the brand image, we went with experience and good judgement. The colors don’t sell initially the experience does, and how well it can solve the challenges. With all of these factors weighed in, we created our first set of fully furnished screens:
Collaboration and community
The tech team had already laid a good foundation for community contributions in the tech areas. For the success of open source nature of Glific and contributions from the community, we needed to have the same environment in design. We received nominations from folks at University of Berkeley, California and UPES.
Lobo introduced Glific to the design community and shared some insight and approach when designing for open source. It turned out to be really inspiring for all of us and the thoughts to be applied not just to one particular project but design approach in general.
Annie Zheng, Grace Ng and Akshara Kaushik have been the initial contributors to Glific designs apart from the core design team. We’re keeping various aspects of product design open for contributions including the communications, UI/UX, graphic design, and research. And no doubt that they’re already leaving their imprints on the product, only to be joined by more people in the coming times.
It surely is a great opportunity for anyone looking to work with design systems, create user journeys, perform user tests, create prototypes, brainstorm features and other fun aspects of creating powerful interfaces and product experiences.
Closing thoughts and the way ahead
We began with a goal to build a cost-effective, and a powerful communications platform for the social impact sectors. Our plan is to create simple, easy to use and engaging product with our design hats donned. We are already receiving good feedback from the user base that our features are powerful, and we want the design to support in making it intuitive and a delight to use.
There are few open source products and even fewer when combined with the social impact sector that get the design treatment that it actually deserves, it is also my goal to change that. Glific has the potential to change the way NGOs communicate with their beneficiaries and it is the design endeavour to make an impact.Title: An Experiment on Funder and Community Building

==================================================

We are back to the good old days of pre-Covid (though the covid rate across the US is quite high).The stream of Indian NGO leaders visiting the Bay Area is peaking and it’s fun to hang out and learn from them. The one issue that has troubled me for some time is how can we expose the amazing work they do to a lot more folks at a bit beyond a one-on-one meeting.  This does not really scale, and people get saturated fairly easily.
This time of the year a lot of NGOs visit NY with a stopover in the Bay Area. UNGA, Climate Week, Clinton Global Initiative, BMGF Gatekeepers, Dasra Philanthropy Forum and more are some of the events that are taking place in NY from Sept 22 – 27, 2024. We had a couple of close NGO friends who were planning to visit the Bay Area the weekend before. Since we love to host visiting NGO leaders, we figured that bringing together a group of folks from the ecosystem might be a good experiment. From a Tech4Dev perspective, we wanted to host an event to thank our funders for their generosity over the past few years, and also give them a better sense of our work.
Thanks to the team at Dasra, we got together a group of 4 NGO leaders: Vanessa from
SNEHA, Mumbai;
Sucheta from
Dream a Dream
, Supriya from
Rebuild India
Fund and Erica from
Project Tech4Dev
. It was a nice coincidence that all four of the leaders were women 🙂We decided to highlight the work of these NGOs to the larger group and give them a sense of the depth and breadth of the Indian social sector, and wanted to facilitate deeper conversations. So, we designed the event with lots of interaction time with a brief 6-8 minute presentation from each NGO. We started off with a 90 min drinks and mingling session to get the conversations going before the lightning presentations, followed by more conversations over dinner and dessert. We also had a few young adults from a few families who were interested in learning more. I asked the NGO leaders to give their top line summary of the event:
The group of people who made the event happen
Vanessa from SNEHA
It was a great platform for India based NGO’s to share their work and engage with donors at a deeper level. US based donors want to support India based NGOs and give back to their country. Such events, when supported by established organizations like Tech4Dev and Dasra, add credibility to the work of the NGO’s, making it easier for donors to take the critical decision to move ahead with an NGO.
Vanessa giving the elevator pitch on SNEHA
Sucheta from Dream a Dream
It was such a pleasure to reconnect with old and new friends of Dream a Dream at the NGO Funder Dinner in San Francisco last week. As we celebrate 25 years of Dream a Dream’s existence it seems like a portal has opened to such amazing stories from the past. And it humbles me to realize how much I have to be grateful for – all the contributions and support that I didn’t even know about – that has made us who we are today. Thank you to everyone who came to show your solidarity to Dream a Dream, and so excited to have made amazing new connections that can move us to the next level of impact.
Erica from Project Tech4Dev
It was wonderful to witness the philanthropy community’s strong interest in understanding the Indian development ecosystem and exploring ways to contribute. Despite it being a Saturday evening with conflicting engagements, many prioritized this event, which was truly gratifying. The group’s engagement through their thoughtful questions showed a genuine eagerness to learn more. As my first experience, it was deeply fulfilling to see so many share the vision of making a positive difference in the world.
Maya Vishwanath a former intern with Project Tech4Dev
What struck me most is how clearly the NGO representatives understand and are closely connected with their beneficiary populations. This understanding, care, and awareness clearly translates to more effective service and outcomes.
The question and answer sessions lead to engaging and valuable discussions. I appreciated that the NGO representatives were willing and eager to engage with tough questions.
Additionally, I appreciated that the NGOs do not fall into the pitfall of “tech solutionism” that we often see. It is clear that the NGOs seek to closely understand the issues that their beneficiaries are facing, and determine the most effective solution – regardless of whether or not technology is heavily involved in that solution.
Priyanka Kohli – switching from the corporate sector
I was particularly excited to hear about successful collaborations that the NGOs have been creating with foundations, government agencies and corporations to create greater impact for the communities they serve. Getting all stakeholders to the table has huge value, and it’s critical we have successful public-private partnerships for sustainable and scalable impact. I was also deeply moved by the statistic that only 10% of India’s NGOs are women-led, though 45% of India’s NGO staff are women. It was timely to hear from Rebuild India Fund and its commitment to support women-led grassroots NGOs.
Concluding Thoughts
I do think the event met its objective of expanding the thought process of a decent sized group in a deep manner. A lot of the conversations and q&a sessions were thought provoking and folks did get a sense of the broad spectrum of work that is being done on the ground. Having multiple NGOs combine their networks and having a bunch of folks in the room who are super smart and have worked in the ecosystem for so many years does show in the quality of the conversations.
Finally super grateful that this turned out to be a mini-reunion of the Yahoo! Engineering team, who have been my strongest supporters forever. Without their backing and support over the past 6 years, we would not have been able to do something like this. Its also very strange to see my personal growth and evolution from those days 😀Title: An Inspiring Field Visit to Bhansali Trust at Radhanpur
Author: Rajeev Mohan

==================================================

In the first week of August 2023, our team from Tech4Dev, including Erica Arya and myself, along with Shrutika and Deepak from Dasra’s Catalytic Philanthropy team, had the honor of visiting Bhansali Trust in Radhanpur, Gujarat. This visit deeply impressed us as we witnessed the incredible efforts of Bhansali Trust to uplift marginalized communities in the remote villages of North Gujarat. We gained valuable insights into diverse projects spanning Education, Healthcare, Community Health, Immunization, Family Planning, Eye Camps, De-addiction, Self Help Groups (SHG), Income generation, and financial aid for the disadvantaged in Gujarat and Bihar. The trust’s unwavering commitment to serving the most vulnerable communities left a profound and lasting impact on us.
Our diverse group, which included Mr. Ashok Bhansali, a founder and trustee of Bhansali Trust, and Ms. Jasmin Sharma from MSI overseeing CSR, gathered in Ahmedabad. Ashokbhai’s thoughtful planning was evident in the comprehensive 3-day schedule he had prepared, starting on August 2nd. The journey to Radhanpur took about 3 hours from Ahmedabad, during which Ashok Bhai shared insights into their family history and background. He also discussed the guiding principles of Bhansali Trust, with one principle standing out  their dedication to quietly and effectively working in challenging areas without seeking self-promotion.
En route to Radhanpur, we made a stop at the Eye Checkup Camp under Chasma Project, located at Khari Dhariyal Primary School, a collaborative endeavor between MSFT and Bhansali Trust. Under the umbrella of Sarva Mangala Family Trust (MSFT), MSI has been driving this initiative where they examine the eyes of the adults and children with a portable refractometer and issue the eyeglasses in the rural areas. A significant objective of our visit was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Chasma Project, particularly to enhance the process of data collection and management through technology. We noticed a substantial number of adults and children patiently waiting in line for their eye examinations. For cases where patients exhibited cataracts or other serious eye conditions, referrals were made to nearby hospitals for cataract surgery and further treatment.
Globally, more than 1 billion people have vision problems that could be corrected or prevented, and the main cause is often refractive errors. The joint actions of MSFT and Bhansali Trust in rural regions are praiseworthy steps in tackling this important problem.
We also got an opportunity to visit Gokulpura, a nearby village within Radhanpur, where we met with a group of over 20 women who were part of the Mahila Mandal of the village. One of Trust’s core areas of focus is women’s empowerment. They have established Self Help Groups (SHG) among socially and economically disadvantaged women. Ashokbhai nurtures a close bond with the beneficiaries, creating an environment where people freely share their challenges and moments of happiness with him. A surprising and heartening revelation was that women from underprivileged backgrounds are stepping into leadership roles, including becoming sarpanch (village head) in the panchayats, thus gradually transforming the status of women in a traditionally male-dominated society.
During our visit, we also had the opportunity to visit a couple of houses in the same village, and it was disheartening to witness the challenging living conditions and circumstances they were facing. In one home, a husband fought tuberculosis while his pregnant wife cared for their four daughters. Another woman, widowed by a road accident, now cares for her three young children. In a different household, a mother of three, one with special needs, navigated her own difficulties. Trust’s unwavering support for these families was evident, and it felt as though they had truly adopted the village.
Ashokbhai provided an overview of Bhansali Trust’s initiatives, addressing diverse needs. Trust actively led various programs and initiatives, such as a TB control program, de-addiction from tobacco and drugs, immunization, tackling malnutrition and child mortality, promoting safe motherhood, addressing childhood blindness, conducting eye camps for cataract and other eye surgeries, providing protein supplements, and adopting Aanganwadis.  The Trust launched a
Mushar project
in Bihar’s Gaya district in 2015, targeting the marginalized Mushar community, classified as ‘Maha Dalit’, providing education through schools and hostels, along with health support from paramedical workers and mobile clinics. The Trust’s micro-credit initiatives through self-help groups offer loans at low rates, empowering women to start businesses, educate their children, handle medical emergencies, and build homes, promoting their independence and decision-making. Ashokbhai and his wife Sheetal commit 12 days each month to field work. His impactful journey in the social sector left us genuinely inspired.
The next day, Ashokbhai introduced us to the Heads of Departments (HODs) in charge of different programs at his office. We conducted separate meetings with each HOD and their teams to gain a thorough understanding of their programs and challenges. Our goal was to provide assistance and enhance the effectiveness of their ongoing endeavors. We interacted with teams responsible for Self Help Group, Kapad, Gram Vikas, Vaccination, Manav Rahat, and Autonomous initiatives.
The
Kapad
program offers stitching training to women and provides them with sewing machines, enabling them to earn extra income from home. The
Gram Vikas
initiative targets impoverished villages for upliftment, aiding families in accessing government schemes, promoting family planning, conducting health check-ups, and addressing addiction issues. The
Manav Rahat
program involves monthly financial aid to needy families. To ensure transparency and prevent fraud, an
Autonomous
team monitors Trust’s programs in each block of North Gujarat. Utilizing
technology
like Phone Tracker, GPS location, and Biometric systems, the Trust efficiently manages and oversees its initiatives.
Bhansali Trust’s community engagement approach is built on a holistic and interconnected view. They focus on providing comprehensive support to families and individuals by combining various program interventions. This approach ensures that every community member gets the needed help to overcome poverty. By addressing multiple well-being aspects and offering diverse support services, the Trust creates a more effective and lasting way to alleviate poverty.
In the afternoon, we were fortunate to tour the Trust’s campus, where we explored workshops outfitted with modern amenities for activities like cloth cutting, stitching training, designer clothing production, and protein powder mixing. While there, we engaged with the diligent staff and individuals contributing to these workshops. They expressed deep appreciation to Bhansali Trust for offering valuable job prospects that empower them to earn income and enhance their lives. The Trust’s dedication to fostering employment and skill growth was clearly seen through the positive impact it has on the people it supports.
During our final day, we stopped by the Naroli High School with boarding facilities while en route to Deesa. We interacted with teachers and students during a science class, and it was inspiring to learn that some of the school’s former students have returned as teachers, contributing to the continued provision of high-quality education at the school.
Subsequently, we toured the impressive Gandhi-Lincoln Multi-Speciality Charitable Hospital in Deesa, established in 1982 through a collaboration with the Zale Foundation, USA. We had the privilege of meeting Mr Mahesh Bhansali, founder & trustee of Bhansali Trust, who has dedicated his entire life to social work and has been actively involved in the villages of North Gujarat. Dr. Soni, the hospital superintendent, and other staff members also warmly welcomed us. The hospital’s de-addiction program, serving individuals from Gujarat, Rajasthan, and other states, left a significant impact. Interacting with the patients in the program, we witnessed their genuine satisfaction with the hospital staff’s care and service. Wrapping up our visit, we enjoyed a delicious lunch with Maheshbhai and Dr. Soni at the hospital’s guest house before heading to Ahmedabad for our flights.
The field visit was truly a memorable experience that I will always hold dear in the times ahead. The genuine openness and warmth exhibited by the Bhansali Trust team have etched a lasting impression on my heart. What’s more, we forged meaningful connections and friendships during our visit, and we are eager to nurture and strengthen these bonds in the future.
Thank you, Ashokbhai, for the incredible hospitality, meticulous planning with attention to every detail, and the wonderful home-cooked meals. Your remarkable endeavors in the social sector have truly left us deeply inspired.
Thank you, Bhansali Trust, for the incredible experience and the opportunity to witness firsthand the impactful work being done to create positive change in communities. Your commitment to making a meaningful difference is truly commendable.Title: An open-source community / ecosystem being built  Work in Progress!

==================================================

It was great attending the quarterly Tech4Dev sprint in Goa. I reached Goa on Sunday, 15
th
Jan in the afternoon and left on the morning of Wednesday, 18
th
Jan.
The programme was divided into
Avni
and
Glific
sprints with some overlap between them. For people of my generation, the Information Technology revolution (which is no less than the industrial revolution) has been a roller coaster ride. I am sure Sanjeev and Lobo would agree with me (though Lobo would probably not like to be clubbed with us, who are 10 years his senior ?). We have graduated from using the unit record machines to computers using punched cards to seeing the birth of the IBM PC and its clones to mobile phones to wearables and so forth.
During this journey, it was interesting to see the birth of free and open-source software. It all began with the launch of the GNU project in early 80s and really caught speed in early 90s with the advent of Linux  where the source of an entire operating system kernel became available for volunteers to build upon. This really opened the gates for many other open-source projects as well, which ran on Linux. Netscape Navigator made it to the open-source in late 90s to make the world wide web accessible to the common man. I used to always wonder on how these things were born and how they continue to thrive.
It was interesting to see one being built at close quarters!
With Avni and Glific, we have our very own contribution to the open-source world  and it is exciting to see these products (Avni from its infancy and Glific from its birth) grow and being used by so many NGOs. Avni is in use with 40+ NGOs while Glific has gone on to capture the imagination of more than 70 NGOs, who have been onboarded.
On January 15
th
and 16
th
, I could attend some NGO presentations that described the way they were using Avni and discussed some of the challenges being faced by them. Most users of Avni, who did not know the varied applications for which Avni was being used, suddenly realized how it could be difficult for Avni team to include seemingly small changes very soon as it could affect something else! On the other side, developers from Avni too got to see the struggles their users were going through and could understand the reasons for the changes they were asking. In other words, this bringing of the NGOs and the developers together makes each of them empathize with the others reasoning. This is one of the key steps in building an ecosystem.
Such an ecosystem in the social sector survives mainly on a good feedback mechanism that allows the development team to collect inputs that not only improve the product but also provide a robust roadmap. The sprints, like the one in Goa, help greatly towards it. While Avni users presented the issues they were facing, they also discussed about the different work arounds or methods used in their own work. I am sure this would have led to a cross breeding of ideas and brought forth solutions to some who were struggling to find them.
The roadmap was also discussed with all the users, while the users voted on the priorities of the upcoming features. Team Avni could also size up their staffing requirements based on the above and already there was a discussion on how they need to double the team in this year to be able to meet the expectations of their users.
From a team that seemed to be in a fire-fighting mode in the past, Team Avni appeared to be far more structured in their approach and mindful of the tasks needed to run a tight ship.
I also had a detailed demo of Glific but because I left on January 18, I could not attend their NGO interactions. It was interesting to know that Glific and Avnis paths would also cross in some interesting use cases. Glific, with its slick and simple user interface, is very impressive and easy to use and implement.
The sprint also provided an opportunity for almost the entire team of
OpenBrackets Foundation
to meet in person. Most members of this team, work from different cities, and quarterly sprints like these are the only times when everyone can meet each other.
The OpenBrackets team
The
Development Data Platform
is going to be the youngest platform offering from Tech4Dev and promises to be of use to almost all NGOs.
For us (oldies, if you may ?), just like the journey from large computers to mobile phones as computing machines excited us, it is as exciting to see a whole set of nebulous ideas grow into sustainable ecosystems!Title: Announcing Tech4Good Software Partnerships

==================================================

After 5 days of being in the picturesque location of
GarudMaachi
, the time had come to bid adieu to the place and to the lovely people with whom we had engaged in the last few days. I personally returned back with a feeling of accomplishment for the Team and the Product.
It is always very fascinating for me to see how on day 1 the diversity in the group shows up so obvious and on the last day we all seem to be a part of one big family 🙂 and that is the magic that such opportunities create. Sprints like these enable the possibility of collaborations, sharing and learning from the experiences of peers, and apprising oneself of the work others in the ecosystem are doing – all this leading to the strengthening of the ecosystem at large.
The impact that we are wanting to create in the community is not small, so how can the efforts be small, hence we need to join hands to be successful in moving the needle.
The sprint was a beautiful conglomeration of the different stakeholders of the ecosystem – software partners, NGO partners, and solution providers. It was a great learning experience for me as I sat through the presentations of each of the participating NGOs (
The Apprentice Project
(TAP),
Reap Benefit
,
VOPA
,
Slam Out Loud
,
Lend a Hand India
,
Avanti Fellows
,
Pehlay Akshar
,
Antarang
,
Indus Action
) hearing them talk about their work and the use of Glific to connect with their end beneficiaries.
The solution providers (
Goalkeep
,
Avni
,
EdZola
,
SarvSutra
) shared about their services/platforms and how NGOs could leverage them for greater impact.
The
Glific
team was available dedicatedly for the participating NGOs for the week to help them accelerate their work on the chatbot in addition demo(ed) the development of new platform features of NLP, Google ASR, and multiple user profiles, this got the NGOs excited and thinking.
The talks were quite informal, and I was amazed to see the depth of knowledge and emotion attached to the work each one was doing. Empathy was at its supreme, and that zeal to contribute to the change was quite evident across the missions of each organization’s presentation. It was a fulfilling experience for me to see the participants proactively sharing their challenges with each other, seeking solutions, and learning from fellow partners. I feel happy for being a part of this enabling environment.
Besides the talks which were spread during different times of the day, the sprint also gave ample space for each to meet their usual work commitments while collaborating with others at their convenience. The flexible structure of the sprint allowed for relaxation, reflection, learning, and adventure. The 5 days were a perfect blend of work and fun.
I am already looking forward to the next sprint to recreate the magic for more partners. If you are a part of this social sector ecosystem and want to join us in the next sprint, do let us know in the comments section.Title: Another India Trip – Another Recap post …

==================================================

Headed home to San Francisco after another energizing and inspirational trip to India and the week revolved around the
Dasra Philanthropy Week
(DPW) and a Project Tech4Dev mini-team meeting. I also met quite a few NGOs both virtually and in person.
This trip was a combination of so many different things, that Ill go back to my favorite list format of highlighting the highlights and misses
Building a team in India was probably the best decision
Project Tech4Dev
made. Its been a year since we hired Erica Arya, and now we are an amazing 14-member team.
A few of Tech4Dev team members at the after event dinner
As a close second, our collaboration with Dasra has been really helpful, primarily since we get significant assistance from them in areas where we just dont have the skills or expertise. As with any relationship, we have a few struggles, but having good communication helps. Our engagement with DPW at multiple levels was a direct result of the collaboration and I do think it helps both organizations grow and build on each other’s strengths
Learned a lot from conversations with the small NGOs that are part of
Dasra’s Rebuild
portfolio. The diversity of the folks involved there and the passion in which they describe their work gives us clarity on where we fit in the ecosystem and how we might be helpful to some of them. It was amazing to see translators present to do live translations of the various talks so folks could understand and participate. First time seeing this at any event in India, and glad that it was done for the event. Really increases the bar for all of us.
The team had a few in-depth conversations with our ecosystem partners and colleagues: Swapneel @ GoalKeep, Shobit @ DhwaniRIS, Santosh @ DataOGram, Gopi @ Dhwani Foundation, Sneha @ Atma Education and Shivangi @ Goonj. The best thing about the space is that everyone is very open and collaboration with folks is a lot easier in the sector. Many of us are facing similar problems and hopefully as a group we can come up with solutions that will improve our effectiveness.
Specifically thinking on how we can help NGOs make better tech decisions when they work with a software company. We do a good job with the NGOs we work closely with, but there are lots of NGOs that need help, and many-a-times they are not aware of the broader ecosystem that they can rely on. We need to figure out how to reach more NGOs effectively. We also need to improve communications between NGOs and partners, and avoid some common mistakes and pitfalls. Funding tech is a big challenge for most NGOs, especially when they separate tech from program. Lots of things to figure out and improve.
Spoke to a few folks from the funder ecosystem. Seems like we are getting a lot more traction and buy-in from them especially with keeping things open and sharing, and designing and deploying common solutions across the sector. I suspect we will work with a few of them later this year.
Had some good meetings with our existing funders with Erica. Its really cool to see how much we’ve grown and expanded over the past year with the work we are doing with NGOs across all our initiatives. Murugan summarizes this quite nicely in his
LinkedIn post.
I’m always so energized after my India trips. Super proud of the team we’ve built. Really helps to have an experienced set of technology folks on the team, since all of them are basically running their own projects with very little involvement from us. I do think this model will help us grow and serve a larger number of NGOs effectively.
Looking forward to see how this unfolds over the next few yearsTitle: Antarang Foundation: Career Aware System
Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

The same technology that we often take for granted in our day-to-day lives is, in reality, a key factor in the progression of our societies. New technological advancements are entering the digital world every single day- it all comes down to pinpointing which technology is the most applicable based on your requirements.
In November 2017, the tech-savvy Donald Lobo
and Kurund Jalmi offered to work with Antarang Foundation, pro bono, in order
to develop a technological solution to process the large amounts of student
data we collect. The aim was to enable our foundation to continue to provide
standardized yet individualized input to the students- on a larger scale,
without increasing manual labour.
The development and production process involved two softwares- Yoctel and Salesforce. A decision was ultimately made to redesign the content and simplify the process by utilizing Optical Mark Reader (OMR) Sheets to input the student data. What seemed like a simple transition from manual data collection to digital data collection resulted in a dramatic change in the number of students we could reach out to and guide.
Prior to the implementation of the technology, our process of data collection and processing used to be time consuming and manual labour-heavy. Every facilitator would individually fill in data from each student into excel before drawing a conclusion on their career path. While there was a specific guidance framework for our trainers, individual differences are inevitable and may have led to subtle biases in the analysis of students? abilities.? In addition to solving the issue with the investment of time, we were seeking a solution that would eliminate any individual biases and enable a standardized analysis for each student.
As of now, Indian municipal schools have
limited digital infrastructure. Considering the quantities of students,
attempting to provide a tablet to each student is not a feasible solution. The
alternate solution to use OMR sheets to collect data served as the perfect way
to solve the problem with regards to quantity: price-friendly and sustainable.
The OMR sheets enabled us to draw connections between high-level inputs from counselors and the inputs from students. Students? answers were digitally available and within seconds, an IARP + Student Aspirations (Interest-Aptitude-Reality-Personality) score was created. The algorithm was designed in a standardized manner to map students? profiles to industries or organizations to find the right match. The students? reports were computed on Salesforce and then reports were created such that concluding information would be easy to digest for both the students and their families. While we were once able to reach only 2,000 students a year, thanks to this technology, we were able to reach 14,500 students this past year and are projected to reach 25,000 in the upcoming year. Additionally, since the system is automatically doing the work, the trainers also have more time to spend focusing on the quality of their direct interactions with students.
Through the impacts we have seen from the technological intervention, the emerging prevalence of technology in our society has become clear. It is evident that technology is soon going to work its way into most work fields and it is important that we continue to build our resources. Thanks to technology, we have been able to reach a much larger youth population and we are hoping that we can continue to scale this impact in the future.

==================================================

Recently, I learned from Arpit at Udhyam about a neat trick: you can use the iphone
Shortcuts
app to automate sending messages on WhatsApp. This is incredibly useful for scheduling birthday messages (especially if you tend to forget, like me) or, in Arpit’s case, for sending daily good morning messages to all his family members at 8 AM.
Inspired by this, I thought, why not see if we can automate sending messages from Glific Since I’ve worked with APIs extensively, it seemed like a natural next step. We could even create quick snippets and shortcuts for others to use (unfortunately, this would only be available for iPhone users).
As a prototype, I wanted to test if I could send a message to one of the recent users on Glific. Here’s the process I followed:
Get the API token using the login API.
Use this token to call the search API, which retrieves the latest contacts and messages.
Display the list of contacts to choose from for sending a message.
Get the text from the user to send.
Use the send message API to deliver the message.
https://videopress.com/v/bHcrXWmg?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true
This simple test got me thinking about many scenarios where automation could be incredibly useful. For example, sending a message to a collection of contacts, even setting a timer for it. The latest 10 messages could be displayed, and all of this could be accessible as an app on the phone so easy!
Moreover, I could create an automation and publish it for others to use, making it possible for NGO clients to take advantage of it. This quick POC shows that it’s workable, and it seems to function well.
https://videopress.com/v/ym6db6nj?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true
I also noticed an automation option that allows SSH into a server and ask ChatGPT. Maybe we could even deploy things using a shortcut app. The possibilities are endless!

==================================================

Started and finished this blog post on the long flight back home to San Francisco. As with all of my other trips, I leave the team and country feeling super-energized as well as quite excited about the path ahead. We did speak about our work to a few funders in the ecosystem and realized that we have accomplished a fair bit in Tech4Dev 1.0 and are in a position to think and execute big with Tech4Dev 2.0
The first part of the trip started with meeting Sujata and Sandeep at
17000ft.org
, Sneha and the team from
Dost Education
, and Vikrant B from
Veddis Foundation
. This was followed by the
Indus Action
(IA) annual retreat. IA has been using these retreats to bring together NGOs from their extended community to learn and grow from each other. They also use
CoLab-X
to facilitate some of their sessions. I think these gatherings are important and it’s great to leave these events with some deep interactions.
Indus Action Annual Retreat Event
I enjoyed and learned a lot from my conversation with Prakhar from
Indian School of Democracy
, Bharat, and Shruti
Fields of View
. We also used the opportunity to do a technical deep dive into the PoWER project with the Indus Action, IDInsight, and
Colored Cow
team. There was also an interesting discussion amongst some of the board members on the open sourcing of knowledge + practice at an earlier stage vs doing it at a later stage. A few members felt that protecting the IP and the ideas at an early stage of the project is important. The discussions are ongoing, but followers of Tech4Dev are aware of our take on this aspect, i.e: we believe that being open, transparent, and publishing things earlier rather than later is beneficial to everyone involved. Yes, there were/are/will-be a few not-so-good players in the space, but in general, are core belief is that this set is a minority and being open is beneficial.
It was also great to meet and see Erica get off the ground in her role as head of Tech4Dev India. Erica, Gayathri, and I had a day of meetings in Delhi with Vikas from
Gramhal
and two different funders. It was inspiring and insightful to hear Vikass story behind the evolution of Gramhal (12 attempts at doing something before they arrived at their current approach). Their current approach of using WhatsApp to share crop prices amongst the farmers and crowd-source information from the local level seems quite good and scalable. We hope to help them out via Tech4Dev on their tech platform, architecture, and scalability. Our funder meetings were great and not-so-good. While we had a great conversation with one foundation who could see the value and what we are doing is potentially a good thing, we did not manage the same with the other foundation team. While I do not expect everyone to fund us, we still need to do a better job of convincing folks of the importance of the broader problem.
I ended the week in Delhi at the ColoredCow offices and joined the team in a design and development sprint with
Reap Benefit,
Alohmohra Education Foundation
, and
STiR Education
. We also invited Bharti from
HAQ CRC
, Apar from
Internet Freedom Foundation
, and Chris Turillo from
Medha
to talk to the team about the work they have been doing over the past few decades.
In my mind, these interactions are super important for us to understand the realities (sometimes quite harsh) on the ground, and the why/how/what they are doing, It helps us when we are supporting them on discord and hopefully makes us a bit more understanding and empathic. We also had a good interchange as a team on the highs, the lows, and how we can do better as a team and as a community. Writing this report, I realized that we forgot to celebrate our two recent grants from
Agency Fund
and
Cisco
. Well need to celebrate on my next trip and hopefully add a few more foundations backing us by then.
For the final leg, I headed to Mumbai to hang out with my family, the
Sharanam Center
women & girls, and wrap up the trip with a couple more funder meetings. I did have a super long conversation with Shilpa where we spoke about both the big picture and the small details. The discussion allowed me to take a broader look at what we are doing, and freely admit to a few things that we could significantly do better, and also encourage our NGO partners to understand and improve on. Both Avni and Glific are a bit overdue for NGO partners who are using the system at scale, and hence can stress test our technology platforms as well as demonstrate how digital public goods can enable NGOs effectively.

==================================================

As I, Erica Arya, start in this key role of
Country Head for India
at Tech4Dev, I feel very upbeat and excited about the possibilities a progressive thought like Tech4Dev opens for its stakeholders around the globe  the donors, the non-profits, the software development partners, and the communities at large.
I am of the firm belief that when the
Right Technological Tools
are applied for the
Right Purpose
and in the
Right Manner
, they can significantly accelerate the adoption of new behaviors and create the desired impact thereby rapidly meeting the organizations objectives.
Over 90% of the non-profits globally continue to operate in a rather traditional way; and are not able to use their scarce resources in an optimal fashion despite all the good intentions and efforts. And Tech4Dev projects can really make a difference in helping them
optimize and scale rather effortlessly
, because thats what precisely is our
raison d’etre!
About Me
In the hindsight, I consider myself to be fortunate sitting at the intersection of design, technology, and product – which equips me with possibly the right skills to produce sustainable, technology backed, impactful human-centric solutions.
After getting a Post Graduate degree in Computer Sciences, I developed software and led Product Development for 12 years in Telecom, Mobile VAS and Digital Imaging.
Transitioned into social sector for last 10 years  specifically Maternal & Child Health, and Agriculture. Designed and implemented scalable solutions for the communities, by leveraging the power of different ICT channels like IVR, Whatsapp, Chatbots, Voicebots, Mobile apps  with three primary goals in mind
promote shared learning in communities, disseminate expert knowledge in real-time, and drive massive adoption.
To sum up, out of the multiple hats I have worn, the one that I have loved the most is that of a Creator. A creator who likes designing solutions for
Digital Transformation of the Non-Profits
, with
deep focus on
Cost, Efficiency and Speed

==================================================

Bridges of Sports
(BoS) works with athletically gifted tribal communities in northern Karnataka and other parts of India to identify potential olympic athletes and train them to their full potential. The coaches involved with BoS conduct training sessions at schools and local playgrounds in the villages of these communities.
We are working with Bridges of Sports to build a comprehensive athlete management system. The system will enable coaches to access and run diet and exercise programs for each athlete under their guidance, collect data for every training session, and monitor the athletes’ progress over time.
Exploring existing solutions
After discussion with BoS, we explored a few existing solutions, to see if any would suit the needs of BoS. We explored OpenCHS, and while it seemed to work for a good part of their data gathering needs, their curriculum structure and league management would not fit well within it. After talking to other t4d members and the team from BoS, we came to the conclusion that a custom solution would work best.
Tech Stack
We decided to go with a native Android app for use by the coaches and a ReactJS web frontend for the admins, with a Python/Django backend. Data gathering will take place mainly on the app – both online and offline, with other organisation level management done by the admins on the web frontend.
Progress so far
We have customised React admin for the web admin portal, it seems to be quite good so far, and easy to work with.
We have also started work on the android app after going through some feedback regarding the resource/curriculum management with BoS in the past week.
We have also set up user permissions for coaches and admin, and the resource management portal.

==================================================

As we grow as an organization, we finally decided to have an official advisory board, to help us think more strategically, challenge some of our assumptions and bring in better governance practices. For the past few months: Erica Arya, Sanjeev Dharap, Arun Kadekodi, Kurund Jalmi and myself (Donald Lobo) have been meeting on a weekly basis as an informal advisory board. We decided to expand the board and got in
Nidhi Goyal
to help complement our current skills especially in the areas of business development, marketing and communications.
I think this is as good a time as any for us to have a board and experiment with how we can improve as a collaborative. This has forced us to document some of our processes, figure out places we need help and things that each board member could help us out with. We are starting off with monthly meetings, which includes a monthly summary and figured it would be useful to recap what we did as a blog post, as part of the pre-read for the board members. An so here we are ….
Am currently in India, and life is completely back to normal. Traffic is back to normal (i.e. crazy), airports are crowded, and face-to-face meetings are back. I met the Dhwani co-founders: Swapnil and Sunandan, who continue to amaze me with their passion, perseverance and drive and then had dinner with the Glific Delhi Team. Also had some good meetings and discussions with Aakanksha and Aashrey @ Act Grants, Geeta and Sanjay @ MSDF and Tarun @ Indus Action. Within Tech4Dev 2.0, our fractional CxO program and our new Development Data Platform seem to be really getting people’s attention. Revenues of the Glific and Avni platforms gives us a way to highlight that we are on track for our open source platforms to be sustainable in a few years from now.
The Glific Delhi Team
Its good to have a set of partners and project leads. My job gets a lot easier, since I can just check with them for the monthly recaps. So without further ado, updates from our various groups
Gayathri Meka making the sales pitch for Women in Tech
Women in Tech
: Completed 6-month pilot for the 4 batches we started with Colored Cow. Out of 21 learners – 3 learners are actively contributing at Colored Cow through an internship (6 more to follow), 4 learners got jobs through campus placements. Initiated the process of starting more batches with SoftCorner. Visited 7 colleges in Pune-Nashik area to identify learners best fit for the program. Expecting to start new batches by end of Sep
Avni
: The Teach tool for AP Government built by World Bank and Leadership for Equity went live in this month. Applications for Indus Action (schemes facilitation) and Lend A Hand India (Livelihood and Education) were delivered to the NGO for testing and deployment. We have a good pipeline of 5 projects going live in the next month. The team is seeing some churn but overall ramp up and looking to onboard more people to the team in developer, analyst and QA roles
Glific
: Our count of active accounts is growing at a nice pace and sits at 54, with the total number of accounts since inception being 60+. We’ve started to see significant spikes in both messages being delivered and active monthly contacts. Our consulting contracts especially with Digital Green and Reap Benefit are allowing us to explore and extend the platform with new technologies: Exotel, Frappe, R/Shiny, Leaflet. The team is working hard to get a few features into the platform before the sprint in mid-Sept
Development Data Project
(DDP): This is still in the planning stages, but so-so close to lifting off. We have a good sense of what we want to build, an amazing set of NGOs that we will partner with for the pilot projects (SNEHA, STiR Education) and a good group of collaborators (Agency Fund, IDInsight, Dhwani RIS). We think we have the right combination of tools that we want to experiment with to begin with (AirByte, DBT, Postgres/BigQuery and SuperSet). Now all we need to do is execute 🙂 I’m super excited about this, especially since it pulls together all of our past work. It also gives our folks a chance to play with another set of technologies and skillsets to keep them excited and going.
Aam Digital:
Just kicked off a project co-creating a customized platform for NGOs managing mentorships in Germany. It’s exciting to design a system so focused on ensuring quality of guidance. This being government funded we are also learning that German ministries see open source as the future but have no concepts yet on how to handle legal and licensing questions. Beyond that, Tech4Dev support is a milestone for Aam Digital but we are also starting to approach social impact business angels to fund the period until we can fully cover our costs.
Fractional CxO:
Has been a slower month for this initiative, but lots of background action. We had two volunteers: Vinod and Sonal move to India this month and they will be up and running at full steam in September.
Vinod R
is joining Tech4Dev full time, and will lead the DDP project and be the SNEHA CxO.
Sonal M
has roped in her husband Anurag and they are working with
Medha
. We also managed to recruit
Ankit S
who will join us in Sept and start work with
Reap Benefit
and
Indus Action
. Finally,
Arvind G
also joined us and he has started consulting with our friends at
Uninhibited
.
Well this short quick monthly update turned out quite long. I’m quite blown away by our progress on a weekly and monthly basis and am indeed super stoked. Great to be working with such an amazing and awesome teamTitle: Automating AWS Infrastructure and docker-superset Deployment with Terraform
Author: Rohit
Date: February 2025
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/automating-aws-infrastructure-and-docker-superset-deployment-with-terraform/
==================================================

By Rohil Muktibodh
In today’s fast-paced world of cloud computing and data analytics, automating infrastructure deployment and management is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. In this blog, I’ll walk you through how I used
Terraform
to automate the deployment of
AWS resources
and set up
Apache Superset
, an open-source data visualization tool, for seamless data analytics.
What is Terraform and docker-superset ?
Terraform
Terraform is an
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using declarative configuration files.we mainly used following terraform blocks in our code.
“resource”          ⇒ this will create new resource on aws infrastructure.
“data”                  ⇒ this will access the currently deployed object and its
attributes.
“local-exec”       ⇒ for  operations on local machine.
“remote-exec”   ⇒ for operations on remote machine.
docker-superset
Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready
business intelligence (BI)
and data visualization tool.
docker-superset
is a set of scripts which the Dalgo team at Tech4Dev uses to run multiple instances of Superset for their clients.
By combining Terraform and docker-superset, I was able to create a scalable, automated infrastructure for data analytics on AWS.
Overview
The goal of this project was to accomplish http traffic from client should be redirected via load balancer to application ( Superset )  running on EC2 instance.
Provision AWS resources (e.g., alb rule on port 443, add inbound rule on EC2 ) using Terraform.
Deploy Apache Superset on an already available EC2 instance.
Automate the entire process to ensure reproducibility.
Step 1: Setting Up the AWS Infrastructure
The first step was to define the AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Here’s what I did:
1.1. Adding additional rule into Load Balancers Port 443
Terraform documentation
Useful Links
explains how each resource can be used.
You need following to create “
aws_lb_listener_rule
”
Listener arn as reference where rule is to be attached.
Rule priority
Condition
Action
To get listeners arn reference , derived from Load balancer name , taken as input.
Rule priority also taken as input
Condition, based on the host header also taken as input.
Action, should be redirecting traffic on to ec2 instance and new target group port,  port number taken as input
This needed new Target group creation and next attaching to an application ( Superset )  running on ec2 on a newly created port.
You need following to create “
aws_lb_target_group
”
New port number , taken as input
vpc-id , taken as input
protocol , “HTTP” ⇒ superset is using HTTP
Health check parameters used default, load balancer will be polling
You need the following to attach the above target group to an ec2 instance. “
aws_lb_target_group_attachment
“.
Target group arn, taken from above after creation.
ec2 instance , taken as input.
1.2. Adding inbound rule to ec2 security group.
We need to allow traffic from alb to ec2 , Terraform documentation
Useful Links
You need following to create “
aws_security_group_rule
”
Type “ingress”
From port and to Port, port number taken as input
Protocol “tcp”
cidr_blocks  ⇒ derived from load balancers aws subnet
Security_group_id , ec2 security group id derived from ec2 instance.
Above operations are set for aws configuration to redirect client traffic.
Now in the next section we will explore how superset applications are copied and deployed.
Step 2 : Deploy superset application on ec2 instance
We need to clone
docker-superset
from github, generate client related files, modify superset.env and ship the whole repo on ec2 instance to run the application using docker compose.
So here are the steps.
Firstly, clone  docker-superset on a local machine, then using Himanshu’s script “
generate-make-client
” with all relevant parameters into directory specified as input.
Next we modify the
superset.env
file which will be eventually used during docker compose to have client specific parameters.
To modify superset.env, we used “
sed
” and took input from relevant parameters from the terraform config file ( viz. terraform.tfvars )
Once the above operation is completed , we use “
rsync
” to copy the whole modified directory on the remote machine where our next operation will happen.
Once in a remote machine, we need to first build a container using Himanshu’s “
build.sh
” to create a container based on inputs given originally while generating the client specific directory. “build.sh” is dynamically created in the client specific directory , its not part of the git repo.
Once the container is available , we fire on the remote machine “
docker compose
” with “superset.env” and the application will come up.
For executing all the above commands we mainly use “null-resource” of terraform, for local machine operations , we use “local-exec”, while we use “remote-exec” for operation on remote machine.
For “remote-exec”, we need password-less access to remote machine/ec2 instance, for which we need to copy the ssh public key into the remote machine.
Step 3 : Accessing superset application.
Once this is done, domain name header e.g. “mydemongo.dalgo.in” has to be incorporated into DNS Server using services of squarespace , making the application accessible from the internet. Which is beyond the scope of these scripts at the moment.
If DNS is set you can use your browser and access the new domain name of the client, but if squarespace is not set you can use the below method of verification.
Run this on your local machine, use new client domain name.
curl -k -H "Host: sneha.dalgo.in"
https://Dalgo-1813425768.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<title>Redirecting…</title>
<h1>Redirecting…</h1>
<p>You should be redirected automatically to the target URL: <a href=”/superset/welcome/”>/superset/welcome/</a>. If not, click the link.
For accessing superset application locally we can use our browser (localhost:9990) running on a laptop, but this is bypassing the load balancer from the equation. Anyhow this will make sure the application is up and running. So you use the ssh-tunnel and use the below command.
ssh -L <
APPLICATION-PORT
>:<
EC2-PRIVATE-IP
>:<
APPLICATION-PORT
> <
USER_NAME
>@<
EC2-PUBLIC-IP
>
ssh -L 9990:10.0.27.174:9990 ubuntu@3.108.52.226
Note
: if you are on windows, you need additional command, this is assuming you are running ubuntu WSL2 on windows.
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=9990 connectaddress=<WSL2-IP-ADDRESS> connectport=9990
Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Steep Learning Curve with Terraform
Problem
:
As a newcomer to Terraform, I initially struggled with its declarative syntax and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) paradigms. The abstraction of resources, state management, and dependency mapping made it challenging to translate infrastructure requirements into working configurations.
Solution
:
To bridge the knowledge gap, I adopted a two-phase approach:
Bash Scripting for Clarity
:
I first implemented infrastructure operations using imperative Bash scripts. This helped me map out the exact sequence of AWS CLI commands (e.g., Target group creation, ec2 security group update ) and understand dependencies.
Terraform Migration
:
Once the workflow was validated, I systematically translated the Bash logic into Terraform constructs (e.g., aws_lb_listener_rule, aws_security_group_rule,”local-exec”,”remote-exec”).
Outcome
:
The iterative approach accelerated my Terraform proficiency while ensuring infrastructure reproducibility.
Challenge 2:
Networking Issues with Dockerized PostgreSQL.
Problem
:
During initial development, I opted for a Docker-based PostgreSQL container to avoid cloud costs. However, the Superset application (also containerized) could not communicate with the PostgreSQL instance due to isolation in separate Docker bridge networks.
Solution
:
Docker Network Analysis
:
Identified that the Superset and PostgreSQL containers were on different Docker networks, preventing DNS resolution.
Unified Network Configuration
:
Used Superset’s Docker network:
docker run -it --network testngo_app-network-testngo-prod-4 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=nosecret -p 5432:5432 postgres:15
Validation
:
Configured Superset’s database URI to use the PostgreSQL container’s IP address  (postgres:5432).
Outcome
:
Seamless communication was established, enabling local development. However, I later migrated to
Amazon RDS
as used in the current environment.
Conclusion
By combining
Terraform
and
docker-superset
, we are able to deploy application and configure aws resources with very little time. Not only did this save time but also ensured consistency on aws. If we use the terraform  “
destroy
” command , it will delete all resources automatically as well.

Author: Mohd Shamoon
Date: February 2025
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/automating-water-source-management-data-with-google-apps-script/
==================================================

One of the most exciting aspects of my work at FCXO is the opportunity to rapidly prototype solutions for unique challenges. Today, I encountered an interesting problem faced by an NGO managing water sources using
KoboToolbox
.
The Problem
The NGO collects survey data to monitor water sources affected or improved by an intervention. The key questions in the survey include:
What is the type of intervention area?
Which water sources were impacted?
Types of Intervention Areas
Catchment Area
– Where rainfall collects and drains into a water body, such as a river or lake. Interventions here may include reforestation, soil conservation, or erosion control.
Outside Source-shed
– Areas adjacent to watersheds that indirectly affect water quality.
Command Area
– Downstream regions where water is distributed for irrigation or drinking.
The survey also collects geospatial data, allowing users to map the intervention areas by inputting coordinates and generating polygons.
The Existing Process
Once the data is collected, the current workflow involves:
Downloading the CSV from
KoboToolbox
.
Cleaning the data manually.
Loading the coordinates into
QGIS
to visualize and validate if the intervention areas align with the affected sources.
This was a tedious and repetitive process. The NGO asked if we could
automate the workflow
to streamline data updates and cleaning while maintaining the ability to visualize the data efficiently.
Automating the Workflow with Google Apps Script
Google’s
Apps Script
is a powerful tool that allows automation within the Google ecosystem. Given the structured nature of the cleanup process, I wrote a script that:
Pulls data from KoboToolbox
using its API, which exports data in JSON format.
Cleans the data
based on predefined transformations.
Writes the cleaned data
directly into
Google Sheets
.
To keep this process efficient, I leveraged
Apps Script Triggers
to automate data fetching at a scheduled frequency (e.g., daily). This ensured that the latest survey data was always available and pre-processed without manual intervention.
Addressing the Visualization Challenge
With data processing automated, the next challenge was
visualizing the intervention areas
. Initially, I explored
Looker Studio
, as it provides great tools for visualization. However, it
lacked native support for displaying polygon-based GeoJSON data
on maps.
Exploring Alternatives
Custom Visualization in Looker Studio
Looker Studio allows custom visualizations using JavaScript.
I considered building one using
Leaflet.js
, but it required additional effort, and I wanted a quicker solution.
Deploying a Web App with Apps Script
Apps Script can also be used to create
simple web apps
.
I built a web app that:
Fetches data from Google Sheets
.
Converts it into proper GeoJSON format
.
Displays it on a map using Leaflet.js
.
Enhancements and Final Touches
To improve usability, I added:
Satellite view options
for better clarity.
Captions and proper zooming
for easy navigation.
Unique map links for each intervention area
, making it easier to inspect specific locations.
The Final Outcome
Now, with a single script execution:
Data is fetched from KoboToolbox
, cleaned, and stored in Google Sheets.
A unique map link is generated
for each intervention area.
Users can visualize and validate the interventions
quickly, eliminating the need for manual CSV handling and QGIS processing.
Key Takeaways
This project highlights how
simple automation with Google Apps Script
can significantly reduce manual effort and streamline workflows. If you work with data processing and visualization, I highly recommend exploring
Apps Script, Looker Studio, and Leaflet.js
to build similar solutions!Title: Avni 2021 Update

==================================================

2021 has been a year of mixed emotions going through Wave 2 of the pandemic, hopes from the availability of vaccines and then again the scare of a new wave. As we went through this, Avni product and community has both consolidated and grown. Read on to know more.
Usage and Impact
We saw an overall
100% increase in the system usage from last year
, which means double the number of services rendered!
Utility in Covid ????
Last year
SATHI
used Avni to roll out surveys to collect information from ASHAs, Anganwadi workers and health committee members of 28 blocks from 13 districts of Maharashtra. This year we saw multiple organisations using Avni in their projects dealing with the pandemic.
Shelter Associates
tracks vaccination status and interest in getting vaccinated in the households of urban slums of Mumbai, Pune and Kolhapur.
ASHWINI Gudalur
set up Avni to help their call centre team to record updates from follow up with all positive cases in the tribal community they serve. The information is available to be seen by doctors in the hospital.
Rythu Swaraj Vedika
used Avni to help their volunteers do the needs assessment in their community villages, to get prepared for an impending third wave.
MahaPecoNet
used Avni to track the relief and awareness activities which reached more than 5 million people in Maharashtra.

Webinar: Avni During Covid
Scale ups by existing Users
In 2021, multiple organisations decided to scale up their projects and Avni played an important role in helping them do so.
Rejuvenating Water Bodies
driven by Caring friends, ATE Chandra Foundation and IIT-IIT was scaled up in 3 states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka. Volunteers and members from 13+ NGOs used Avni to record daily desilting work and distribution of silt to farmers. In 2022 the project plans to further scale up covering newer states.
Jan Swasthya Sahyog scaled up the
Sickle cell screening project
to another district in Madhya Pradesh.
JNPCT
app was earlier used by supervisors and is now rolled out to Arogya Saheli, their frontline ASHA like workers.
Avni for Offline Stock Management
Swasthya Swaraj
works in rural Odisha running community health centres in 3 remote locations. It gets difficult to manage the drug stock using paper based registers. Missing out on returning expiring drugs and ensuring stock is replenished at right levels is challenging. An offline digital system was desired. We built a new android application using the Avni platform to help solve the problem. The pilot is successfully completed and it is all set to go live with the new year.
New additions to family
Save the Children
joined the Avni users’ family as they rolled out the app in their Assam tea plantation project to protect children from labour, trafficking and other vulnerabilities.
Saahas
is all set to roll out Avni to their project managers across 20+ projects on sustainable waste management to track their key success indicators.
Kaivalya Education Foundation
would be using Avni to track attendance and engagement with children, imparting them life and employability skills as part of the YW NXT project.
Avni Capabilities
Based on demand from the users and need on the ground we continued to add more features to the product. Avni now supports
Custom extensions
to plugin your own web application for use cases like report card and ID card prints.

improve the usability and engagement. We continued to review and improve on security and scalability.
Other Updates
ASHWINI now has Avni integrated into their hospital management system Bahmni. The data seamlessly flows both ways. This will provide a holistic picture of each patient and better continuum of care for patients. We anticipate more such integrations with newer platforms in 2022.
We conducted a few webinars where our partner organisations shared their learnings from the ground. The webinars received good participation and engagement. Do check out
Avni s webinar playlist.
Given the current times, you may find ????
Community based work and COVID19 : Learnings from the ground
very relevant.
Going with the open source spirit, the Avni team participated in a 2 day
FOSS hackathon
to build a prototype for
Canned Analytics
and won a prize too! ???? The prototype is rolled out to a few users and we are getting good feedback. We plan to work further on this feature in the coming year.
Avni won a grant ???? from Zerodha and
FOSS United
to build Rule designer which would be a major step in enabling nonprofits to design their application without having to write code. We would be starting on this as the new year 2022 begins.
In 2021, 76% of Avni expenses came from project revenue, with most of the product capabilities growth supported by existing and new users.The deficit was filled by grants.
We also have a brand new short video introducing Avni, ???? Yay!!!! Do check it out.
In 2021, all of the Avni core team members continued to work remotely from their hometowns staying closer to the family.
We d like to use this opportunity to thank all those who have been with us in this journey – our users, partners, funders and well-wishers. Together we will continue to cross new milestones.
As the risk of a new wave due to Omicron stares at all of us,
we wish you, your family and the communities you serve a very safe 2022.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/avni-app-designer-cohort-2-project-update/
==================================================

We
wrote in March
about the scope and details of the second set of enhancements to the App Designer in an earlier blog post. It has been a few months, and the project is complete. This is an update of the progress in the App Designer, pending items and the future course.
Forms page of App designer
The initial phase
We chose to go forward with the list of features identified as part of the scope. We were, for the most part, going in line with the list of planned features on time.
One clear objective of the project was that the App designer has to be feature-complete. An implementer must be able to setup an implementation without having to run a script or ask the instance maintainer for help. This was of primary importance. Once this was possible, we could focus on features to make implementer’s life easier, and then progress towards having novice users without tech background use the App Designer (in the future).
During the initial phase, we strictly worked on the list of features we had. Slowly, new implementations started using the App Designer to setup their apps. There were implementers from Samanvay, Soft-Corner and Ashwini using the App Designer. We were churning features every week for what was required by implementers last week. It was crazy for both us and the implementers. A big thanks to all our implementers for their patience !!!
Having a variety of implementations helped us understand gaps in scope. We also discovered usability bugs that we fixed on the way. Several new features were also being added to the product, and enhancements corresponding to these features also made their way into the App Designer.
The final month
Showcase and bugbash
By the end of April, we had a major showcase and bug-bash. We invited everyone to take the app for a spin to find out how it looked. Both the implementers and us developers were too much in the system to think outside the box.
As expected, we discovered several places where the app needs to change. We took a list of changes, combined with our own list and tried to prioritise them. Here is what we used to prioritise the cards
Functional bugs
Missing features (Stuff from the original scope, with maybe one or two we discovered along the way)
Usability bugs
New features (Stuff from the original scope)
Of course, there was some subjectivity in the prioritisation. We took into account the criticality fo the issue, feasibility of a fix, and time required to fix to choose items. However, the general principle was adhered to most of the time.
By now, it was clear that some promised features will have to be deprioritised to make space for the new items that had come in. Notable among what we had to deprioritise include declarative rules and kickstarter modules.
Passing the baton in the last month
The last month also saw several changes in the team. Hiren moved on to spend more time with the data entry app. Amar started working on implementations for Shelter and Setco. Vinod and I started spending more time with the App Designer. Swapnil, Garima and Nupoor stayed on till the end.
We also saw Sanjeev join in. Sanjeev tried setting up a new organisation for testing and provided a lot of useful feedback. His focus on the usability of the product was very important at this time when our focus also had been in sweeping out the small things that make implementer’s life simpler. Sanjeev provided feedback both at the micro-level (font size looks wrong, alignment is off etc) and at the macro-level (product focus).
Moving all development to production
All the implementation work being done by Samanvay, Soft corner and Shelter was already using App Designer since January 2020 but from a staging environment. In the last month, that is May, we also moved implementations to start using the production environment. Until now, features were not available, and we were not ready to move every new feature to production. It made sense for implementers to stay in staging and get the latest updates. However, it was not a permanent thing. Continuous deployments mean frequent outages, and bugs can stop work until they get fixed. Production environment was more stable. Once the churn of new development died down, we moved all implementations to start using production as their primary testing environment.
In fact, right now, all you need to do is signup on the website to create your own organisation to try out implementing Avni. Go on to the
website
and give it a try (or send it over to someone you think might find it useful).
We also made a
public announcement
.
Where to next?
Right now, an external implementer can implement Avni for their organisation on their own. We are feature complete. It may not be the best experience. But that is the next step. According to our implementers, the hardest parts now are
Writing and testing rules
Understanding failures in the system
Dependency on an android device or emulator and longer development cycle
For newer implementers, we will have to make our domain language simpler. There are also some places where usability can be better.
Every living product needs some product love from time to time. The App Designer development is not over. Avni is in a better shape now. And will get better over time. And we will continue to listen and continuously improve.

==================================================

Scope of the Cohort 2 project of Avni UI Designer
Samanvay and Soft corner have been working to build App Designer for Avni so that all the implementation work can be done via a web interface. This enables the scaling of Avni implementations by making the following possible:
Easy onboarding of new implementers
Allow self-servicing for simple use cases by NGO IT person
A basic web interface was developed under the previous cohort of tech4dev. The web interface is in beta and has been shared as a pilot to new implementers and NGOs part of this cohort. This project aims to complete the identified backlog from the previous project and also incorporate feedback from the pilots. Following are focus areas/themes identified for this project to prioritise features:
All the features available as of now in the product become configurable via UI interface (Avni product keeps adding newer features and configuration, so new features will not be covered under this as that becomes a moving target).
Improving ease of use
Test Cases
A tech implementer would be able to do end to end implementation of any complexity on own using community resources and without needing Samanvay?s support
A semi tech person like a Program coordinator will be able to make minor modifications to an existing app or design a simple app with simple rules like SkipLogic and validations.
Features
Workflow
Make it possible to attach forms to entities like subject type, program, and encounter type from the screen of the entity itself. Currently, it requires the user to go to form screen and specify multiple things which makes it complex for new users to map forms correctly.
Declarative Rules
Make it possible to specify skip logic using UI(without having to write code).
Inline concept creation
Ability to create a backing concept inline when adding a new form element for the form. Right now it requires one to keep the concept screen open in another tab and create concepts.
Kickstarter modules
Allow users to choose from pre-existing modules(child, mother, adolescent, etc) as a base when starting a new implementation.
Incorporate feedback
Fix things that come from the feedback when users use the UI Designer.
Features NOT Implemented
Make App serviceable by a non IT person at NGO someone like a Founder or project manager with zero experience of using tools like these.
Organisation groups and group admins
Automatic billing, renewal, subscription, etc

==================================================

Recap
In our
previous blog post
, we mentioned why
Avni
requires a UI Designer. We also mentioned that we will be implementing an MVP UI that allows users to be able to design programs and forms.
What is the current status?
By the end of December, we have released all these features and App Designer has started being used internally. Right now it is possible to create main domain entities of Avni like subject types, programs, encounter types, etc via UI. It is possible to build forms using UI.  It is possible to write JavaScript based rules for various things like skip logic, scheduling, decision support, etc directly from the UI Designer. We have received feedback from internal implementers that this is definitely a major improvement compared to the command line and JSON based system that we had earlier.
Where we go from here
The current version is more of an MVP product so it lacks refinement. E.g. while it is easy to build a form but it is not easy to attach it in the right place. So we are going to work on a feature that fixes this by building a workflow.
We think that the current rule system that requires writing JavaScript code is very powerful but we want to make it possible for non-programmers to write rules. So we are going to work on declarative rules that can be specified using UI and without having to write any code.
Overall the theme for the next project is to make the app intuitive to use. We will be publishing the project scope and plan soon.Title: Avni

Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: July 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/bangalore-sprint-first-ngos-sprint-for-dalgo-and-quarterly-review/
==================================================

We had our first NGO sprint in Bangalore and we managed to invite our existing clients and some good set of new clients. We?re really thankful to these NGO?
Goonj
,
CMHLP
,
Adhyayan
,
TAP
,
Arogya World
,
Udhyam
,
Noora Health
and
ATECF
? to join us.?
This time we had it in mind what we needed to show to our current customers and the new one. Engineering team had worked hard to release different features like
UI for Transformation
,
Data Statistics
, Data Quality and
Qualitative Data Analysis
and we planned what we needed to show on the Platform to the NGO?s. This time we decided to give NGO?s free 10 hour POC to help them understand and build a small use case with Dalgo and we planned before what we wanted to do with each of the NGO.
Pre Planning for the Sprint
This is what we planned for CMHLP so that in our focus time with NGO;s we can build a few metrics they want and help them build it if possible.
Adding the org in production.
Source, Destination, Sync and Superset will be set up.
The Requirements for metrics will be finalized before the sprint
Superset access will be given on the basis of role.
Session time will be focused on the data transformation and visualization work
In the team we divided each NGO with 4 people in our team and everyone was very active and did the pre-work beforehand which was really nice to see.
Working time with NGO?s
We first had a presentation with existing NGOs and they presented how Dalgo is helping them with their automation of the Data Pipeline.
Then we had 4 stations to show the NGO?s about the latest features in Dalgo. I had a great time explaining CMHLP and Adhyayan about the Dalgo, UI for Transformation, Data Statistics and Data Quality. They were really impressed with the platform and asked me a lot of questions.
After this we started working on the POC with few NGO?s which we had pre-assigned to and I got a chance to work with CMHLP which works in the field of Mental Health, Human Rights and Law.
They?re using Commcare to collect the data and we have already set up a full pipeline.
Me and Devi devi built a few metrics which they had given us in the requirements.
We built few analytics table so Nitish from CMHLP can try and build few charts on superset which he did and figured that it;s not very hard to figure out which he was happy to see
We added few test cases to show the data quality which was helpful to them and they understood why it’s important
At last, everyone shared what they?ve done in these two days and they presented what we?ve done within 10 hours.
Overall, NGO?s gave us a 4.5 rating about the sprint which was great to see. We?ve also got few comments on how we can improve this going forward.
Quarterly Review
Highlights and Updates
Engineering team worked really hard to deliver multiple features and was very active with consulting which was great to see how the team has balanced this.
Shamoon implemented the first POC with Udhyam using UI for transformation.
We delivered 650+ consulting hours with multiple clients.
Big win with
ATECF
which was a very complex project and I?ve attached the case study which we have written on the engagement.
Himanshu joined us as a new frontend developer.
Misses and Improvements which we can do
We can do a better job with maintaining the NGO?s pipeline and reduce the pipeline failure overall.
We can provide better logs and notifications to our users.
UI for Transformation is good right now but we can make it better and we?ve got some right things to build and improve now.
We need to keep an eye on how our partner works and deliver the work to NGO?s.
Overall the quarterly review went great and we were happy to see lobo?s comment
Shout out to the entire dalgo team for working together to organize an amazing and incredible sprint and pulling together a good group of interested NGOs. To top that off, they also had a comprehensive review of the previous quarter. Great job dalgo team
Apart from this. Team really enjoyed working together this last week. We reflected back to our last internal team meeting and this time Ashwin joined us to make it interesting.
Rohit, Ashwini and Ashwin asked the team bunch of questions and how they feel about working in the organization
According to this, Team feels they?re not sufficiently connected to our customers.
Team doesn?t have enough time to learn or research outside of working hours.
There are few concerning things which we need to work on this quarter and improve this.
This was a good reflection for us as a team and we will do this again in the next quarter. Stay Tuned

==================================================

At
Project Tech4Dev
, we’ve been running sprints and
Data Catalyst Program (DCP)
with the
The Agency Fund
for a while now. This time, we’ve set up shop at the Angsana Oasis and Spa in Bangalore. If you missed our last sprint in Africa, you can read about it
here
.
Most of us arrived on July 14th, a day before the sprint started. In the evening, we had our first informal chat over tea with a smaller group, including Linus and Temina from
The Agency Fund
, whom we had only talked with via email in the past while planning the sprint so it was really great to finally meet them in person.
Later, we all gathered for dinner and drinks, giving us a chance to interact more, learn about each other’s backgrounds, and hear about the different places they came from to attend the sprint and the organizations everyone represented. These informal chats are always a fantastic way to build connections and get to know each other better.
Next Day, we kicked off this sprint with opening session by Temina and Tejas, who welcomed everyone and laid out some basic rules: be attentive, be on time, and embrace open source which are a big part of
Project Tech4Dev
‘s ethos
After that, we split into two tracks: User Engagement and LLMs.
I joined the LLM track, which offered a great mix of presentations from various NGOs, hands-on LLM sessions, a few behind the scenes discussion, and more.
NGOs Presentations
We had some fantastic NGOs present their work, including
Digital Green
,
Bandhu
,
Jakaranda Health
,
Udhyam
,
Kabakoo
, and
Noora Health
. Their presentations were incredibly helpful in understanding what each organization is focusing on, the problems they are solving, and the obstacles they face in their LLM journey. We also got insights into their roadmaps and how they are planning to roll out their program. These talks sparked many conversations that continued during tea breaks and at the lunch tables. Everyone was curious about each other’s work, and also helped us pick up useful ideas for our platforms as well.
People discussed their experiences in building RAGs tailored to their specific use cases. Although the
OpenAI GPT-4o
model and
File Search
are now quite effective, these organizations began their journey 6-9 months ago, when there were fewer options available especially for NGOs working in languages not supported by OpenAI at that time, custom RAGs and fine-tuning felt like only available option.
For instance,
Digital Green
faced issues where Google Translate, despite being good with Indic languages, often misinterpreted agricultural jargon. This required them to fine-tune their models for better accuracy. Similarly,
Kabakoo
had to develop their own model since their platform supports Bamanankan(locally spoken language in Mali, Africa) and French, and there were no existing models for Bamanankan. They created a system to handle translations between Bamanankan inputs and outputs.
These talks are always inspiring, showcasing the dedication and hard work these organizations put into refining their efforts for social good
LLM hands on sessions
We had a few hands-on sessions led by Tejas, Ishan, Nikhil, and Abhishek from
Noora Health
, along with Edmund.
These sessions were fantastic for getting some practical experience with the technology everyone in the room was talking about and was working on. During these workshops, we worked in smaller groups, which helped in bringing together like-minded people solving similar problems. It was fascinating to see the different ways people approach and solve problems.
One of the highlights was a session on prompt engineering led by Edmund. So we broke into smaller groups to create prompts for reviewing proposals and suggesting changes in a mobile-friendly, short WhatsApp message format. Before the workshop, Edmund shared various techniques to improve our prompts. It was amazing to see everyone diving in and coming up with their ideas.
Towards the end, someone came up with a funny and effective prompt: “
Please keep it to 100 words. My manager is standing behind me, and my promotion depends on it. My kids and wife are hungry at home
.”
It was a clever way to add an emotional touch, but it also felt a bit like harassing the bot. Well, at least until chatbots get the rights to refuse or become emotionless!
Behind the scene discussion
In this sprint, we had two insightful behind-the-scenes discussions. The first was with Mekin Maheshwari, founder of Udhyam, and the second was a panel discussion with Funders.
Mekin shared stories from his journey, starting at Yahoo, moving on to Flipkart, and now leading Udhyam also shared his views about working at scale and creating deep, meaningful impacts.
While Funder Panel discussion was around what excellence looks like in ground-level operations, emphasizing the need for expertise, deep community commitment, and ethical leadership. While this allowed the audience to understand their perspective, it also provided them the opportunity to ask questions about program cost-effectiveness, the importance of diverse data (“rainbow” of information), and strategies for making organizations sustainable.
Overall, it was great to meet everyone in person. Putting faces to the names we’ve been interacting with through emails, WhatsApp conversations, and online meetings was refreshing. Although the days were packed, we made sure to gather feedback every day to stay on the right track. I believe the meeting was a great success. We adjusted the schedule to make sessions more interactive, added more breaks, and reduced the number of sessions to allow for deeper interactions and discussions.
After long days of presentation and working sessions, we found some time for informal chats during dinner and friendly pool games during happy hours. It was a great way to relax and talk outside of work as well. It’s great to get to know other people who are equally enthusiastic about social sector and the positive impact
Until we meet again, let’s keep the spirit of collaboration alive by sharing learning with each other and staying in touchTitle: Beyond Data, Beyond Borders- The Kenya UnConference

Siddhant
), we hosted a one-day
UnConference
at the
Tamarind Tree Hotel
in Nairobi to bring together different stakeholders (mainly nonprofits, social enterprises, service providers) from the social impact ecosystem in Kenya. This blog describes the event and how I think it went.
The UnConference was planned with two key objectives in mind.
For Kenyan nonprofits to step outside of their day-to-day to; connect with the larger ecosystem, share openly, learn from each other, and solve problems together, with a focus on data for social impact and learning.
For the cohosting team to build a collaborative space to discuss and develop a collective understanding of the social impact landscape in Kenya, explore synergies and build avenues for future collaboration.
We planned the UnConference in a fairly short timeframe of about a month! We knew we couldn’t do this alone and in just a few days of outreach, Jim from
Tech Matters
, connected us to
Degan
from
Adeso
. Degan was tremendously helpful, she appreciated the aim of the initiative and helped reset our expectations (from 10 to 20 nonprofits to at least 50!) and connected us to
Dawit
, who, in my opinion, embodies the spirit of openness, collaboration and community building that Project Tech4Dev aims to create. Within a matter of days we went from three partners (
Dasra
,
The Agency Fund
and Project Tech4Dev) to seven with our new partners (
East Africa Philanthropy Network
,
Global Giving
,
Let’s Create Africa
and
Adeso
) from Kenya!
I must say this was the most smooth and productive collaboration I have ever had the privilege of being a part of. I think this is because it was built on a mutual trust and a common vision and understanding of what we sought to accomplish.
On the day of the UnConference we had over 80 participants (luckily everyone fit in the conference hall!)
After a quick internal debrief we started the day off by introducing the event and cohosts to our participants. It was amazing to see Dawit,
Wahiga
, and
Matilda
inject the room with energy and direct this energy towards a spirit of openness and cross learning.
During the first session, Data Beyond Borders, nonprofits had the opportunity to share the excellent work that they were doing with the attendees. We had a few tech surprises with the projector which the presenters handled quite well.
In the true spirit of an unconference, Dawit then ran a round of elevator pitches amongst our participants where anyone could volunteer to take a minute to share what their organization does and why, following which he would ask the audience if they would want to fund this initiative. This led to some engaging back and forth in the room and gave us an opportunity to quickly learn about the different initiatives and interests in the room.
After lunch, we moved into roundtable engagements, this constituted product/project demos, working groups, and discussions on key themes for the unconference; Open source platforms for the social sector, AI enabled chatbots, Data for storytelling, Building an ecosystem of collaboration, and Data driven learning and Experimentation. Data for storytelling generated the most interest amongst our participants (easily the biggest circle). Hats off to all our facilitators for making this the most lively and engaging segment of the day.
The roundtable discussions and demos were a great format, the discussions served as a safe space where participants shared why they do what they do, their challenges and their aims. Through the demos, participants were able to build a tangible understanding of how to use data and tech for impact.
We had initially planned for the participants to switch groups every 20 minutes so that they could be part of multiple discussions, but they became so deeply engaged that almost all of them stayed within their original groups for the entire 90 minutes! Since this was an unconference, we adapted and let things flow as per the participants interest. (Though every 30 minutes I did continue to yell out for people to switch groups if they wanted to, much to their amusement)
I was also happy to see that there was significant interest in product demos for
Glific
and
Dalgo
! Krishna and Siddhanth had their hands full during and after this session!
We closed out the day with a fun activity facilitated by Matilda which involved some clapping (I hope she mentions and explains it in her blog), broke for tea and networking at around 4pm!
I’d call this a resounding success and a great start towards furthering our mission of transforming the way nonprofits use data and technology for social impact globally.
As we breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the day and debriefed, some key insights that we had were:
This was a great opportunity to learn from grassroots NGOs and understand the key issues that NGOs are trying to solve for (teen pregnancy, employability and entrepreneurship, education, gender based violence, deforestation and climate change)
Collaboration grounded in trust has been the basis of this event’s success.
Less presentations, more discussions, demos, and working groups
.
There is a common interest in:
Storytelling with data
Events like these, the high turnout and sustained attendance is evidence of this.
WhatsApp chatbots (given the
high penetration of WhatsApp in Kenya.
)
Solutioning collectively is useful for the ecosystem. More so when this is done in a non-funder-centric environment
We should do more events like this in the future and our partners in Kenya should take the lead!
As with all Tech4Dev adventures, I am happy, tired, and thinking of what next.

==================================================

This blog is written by Anand Gopakumar from
The Apprentice Project
For someone who has worked in the impact space for years, this sprint was a unique experience, witnessing how rigor in evidence and technology can come together. I have attended countless discussions on AI, but never one that delved this deep into the technical fine-tuning, validation strategies, and benchmarking of AI models.
From understanding how AI models are fine-tuned to specific contexts to exploring evaluation frameworks that ensure AI actually works, the level of depth in these conversations was remarkable. A key takeaway was that AI is not just about building models—it’s about proving that they work, that they are equitable, and that they drive meaningful change. Hearing about golden datasets, ground truth validation, and iterative improvements made me realize the sheer effort required to make AI solutions reliable, especially in high-stakes development sectors.
At the same time, the sprint was not just about technology—it was about the people, the conversations, and the community. One of the most insightful discussions revolved around when and where AI should be used—and more importantly, when it shouldn’t be. Not every problem needs AI. Sometimes, an age-old rule-based algorithm or a finite set of parameters can work just as effectively. This balance of excitement for AI with a deep understanding of its limitations was refreshing.
Beyond the formal sessions, it was the informal discussions, shared insights, and hallway conversations that built a sense of camaraderie. Nonprofits working in this space often feel isolated—there are few organizations navigating both tech and impact with this level of depth. This sprint helped build a community, a network of practitioners who can reach out, learn, and share openly. Knowing that others are also struggling, experimenting, and innovating makes the journey feel less daunting.
What stood out most was the spirit of openness—organizations sharing their fine-tuning strategies, their methods for validating AI, and their experiences with building scalable models. The idea that knowledge should be shared freely so that others can build upon it resonated deeply.
This sprint wasn’t just about learning—it was about finding a community that will continue to push the boundaries of AI for impact. The conversations don’t end here; they are just the beginning of a shared effort to ensure AI is built responsibly, rigorously, and in service of real-world challenges. Excited for what lies ahead, and grateful to have been part of these powerful discussions.Title: Building Dalgo’s UI for transformation

==================================================

Dalgo’s UI for Transformation is our next big towards enabling nonprofits to use and learn better and more easily from their data. Through this update you can perform a wide range of operations such as renaming, filtering, aggregating, and joining data sets, all through a simple and intuitive interface. This eliminates the need for users to have extensive programming knowledge or expertise in data manipulation, making it accessible to a wider audience.
It’s now as simple as clicking on a function, setting it up (ex: Subtract column B from column A to create new column C), creating a new table, and checking if it looks and works the way you want it to.
Ishan has covered the why, what and how of the feature in
this amazing blog.
This feature release makes Dalgo accessible to a new and much larger section of our nonprofit ecosystem.
If you want to build stable, sustainable data pipelines easily then you should reach out to us at
support@dalgo.in
. We’re happy to offer you a trial and/or run a short proof of concept with you to get you up and running on the platform.
From a product development perspective I think we’ve learned and grown immensely while working on this.
Inform your specs with data:
We referred to the transformation models for all our existing nonprofits and checked to see which functions were used most often. These became the functions that we picked to include in our first release of this feature.
Respect the Process:
Spec>Design>Develop>Test, test, test
Giving this process the respect it deserved allowed us to execute far more efficiently than before. That’s not to say there weren’t gaps, but just being dedicated to the process has allowed us to spot them and know to fix them the next time around.
Design: Shoutout to Vrushabh and Kewal from
Think201
for creating the designs for our feature. Think201 has been building designs for Dalgo since the outset. Having designs and discussions on the same with Vrishabh and Kewal helped us think through our user flows in a lot more detail and gave engineering clarity on what needed to be done. Sometime later this week they’ll audit our release and let us know how we can do better for our users.
An open question we have now is how much design is the right amount of design for different types of feature releases to ensure effective and timely execution.
Adapt and Iterate: At each stage in the process we have had to rethink some assumptions, review our plans, adapt, and then move forward. Our specs doc has seen at least four major iterations, without which this feature release would not have been possible.
Test, test, test:
This gets to be its own point because it’s been a great learning curve for us and really brought us together as a team. We put down over 160 test cases (thanks to Tejas for showing us how
Glific
does it) and tried them out. This helped us catch bugs, identify new feature requirements, prioritize them, and polish the feature out, and inspired even more testing.
We also tried to replicate a few pipelines with some real NGO use cases. This helped us spot some high priority features that we need to add in our next update of this feature.
Demos and Beta testing: We ran an early demo for some of our current users and requested them to become beta testers for our product. We’re also looking for more Beta testers! (email us at
support@dalgo.in
to become a beta tester).
All in all, the testing, prioritization, and fixing loop really helped build fluid teamwork between product and engineering.
Really looking forward to seeing this feature grow and to our
future releases
. Particularly excited about working towards building AI functionalities into the platform to make it even easier for you to learn about and from your data!Title: Building Data Culture within Non-profits

==================================================

This blog post is written by Swapneel from
Goalkeep
I had the privilege of attending the
Glific
+
Avni
Sprint this week at the beautiful Garudmaachi Training Center near Pune and had the daunting task of kicking off the week with the first session.
With more than twelve non-profits and four technology partners in attendance, it was an extremely valuable platform to introduce
Goalkeep
and our work to the Glific + Avni ecosystem and get everyone thinking about data culture:
We talked about three critical outputs that Goalkeep holds close to its mission:
Investing time in discussing, articulating, and prioritizing
key questions
helps bring focus to a project/solution/pilot program; they also act as the measures-of-success
Data models
serve as a bridge between planning and execution and (if kept updated as solutions evolve) make data analysis almost effortless
Embedding
data reviews
within regular team routines, delegating the responsibility of facilitating them to different team members, and closely tracking the next steps to ensure accountability makes working with data is fun, intuitive, and rewarding
We also demonstrated the values of these outputs by sharing the work Goalkeep has done with Dost Education in automating the analysis of IVR prompt data, which now allows Dost to:
Track user journey from
knowledge retention
to
attitude change
to
behavior change
track outcome achievement by comparing desired response rates for baseline to the midline to endline questions for the same set of users
I was particularly happy that questions continued for more than an hour and a half after the presentation, and also over the next two days; these include:
Wouldn’t you need to ask a nuanced question (e.g. have we signed up this month) to answer a high-level key question (example: how is my program doing)?
If I have a very well-defined measurement framework with multiple inputs, outputs, and outcomes, with indicators for each, how do I go about prioritizing which indicators to measure?
I particularly loved this sprint because it had teams and individuals working hands-on to implement solutions that would make their programs better. I saw how far
the Glific platform
had come and the various features planned in its roadmap. My favorite was the Profiles feature that lets multiple users (think siblings or parents) interact with WhatsApp on the same mobile phone while still tracking individual user journeys independently. I also learned about
the robust Avni platform
and its case management feature. Its integration with Glific,
Exotel
, and
Salesforce
(currently under development) really got me excited.
The culture of inclusiveness is at the center of these sprints, from ensuring that program staff (and not just org leaders) attend to actively encouraging non-native speakers of English to share their work and stories. Lobo,
the Tech4Dev team
, and Arun,
SoftCorner
should take credit for setting this high standard. My special thanks to Arun for (among many other things) helping out with logistics and showing me the Ghats of Western India like I have never seen.
For everyone who attended, I hope the session and subsequent conversations sparked some curiosity about the need for building a strong data culture within our programs, people, and processes. Do reach out on

Author: Rajeev Mohan
Date: April 2024
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/building-ecosystem-highlights-of-the-inaugural-tech4impact-non-profit-cto-convergence-event/
==================================================

We are thrilled to announce the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact non-profit CTO convergence event, hosted by Project Tech4Dev! This event, hosted in Bengaluru on April 5th, brought together over 100 technology leaders representing a diverse set of 58 organizations, including NGOs and tech companies dedicated to serving the social sector.
The event’s agenda was thoughtfully curated to maximize engagement and interaction among participants. It featured a series of short presentations, engaging demo/display booths, a panel discussion with esteemed funders, and facilitated roundtable discussions on pertinent topics such as AI, data governance, DPGs, and collaboration with government entities. Additionally, ample networking opportunities were provided, allowing attendees to forge meaningful connections and lay the groundwork for future collaborations.
It’s very pleasing to note that although the event was organized by Project Tech4Dev, it was predominantly community-driven, with individuals from various organizations actively participating to ensure its success.
We started with an engaging speed networking session run by Bhumika Manjunath of Goalkeep, whose lively facilitation through the day infused the event with energy and positivity. After this, we heard some introductory words from Donald Lobo and Erica Arya of Tech4Dev on the purpose of the event, and the importance of building a tech ecosystem for the social sector .
This was followed by a captivating talk by Aman Dalmia, AI lead at Hyperverge. He talked about the rapidly growing capabilities of LLMs and their application in the non-profit sector.
This was then followed by roundtable discussions, facilitated by esteemed subject matter experts such as Pritam Sukumar (Avanti Fellows), Chethan Elvis Das (SocialBytes Technologies), Aman Dalmia (Hyperverge), Gaurav Godhwani (CivicDataLab), Sanjeev Belagur (Aastrika Foundation), Laxman Joshi (Lend a Hand India), Sumit Arora (Centre for Wildlife Studies), Gaurav Dhingra (Refresh Ideas), Swapneel Rane (Goalkeep), Nivedita krishna (Pacta), Piyali paul (Tech4SocialGood), David Menezes (People+AI), and Nitin Malik (The/Nudge Institute). The roundtable facilitators led dynamic discussions on pertinent topics exploring AI, data governance, DPGs, government collaboration, NGO tech capacity, and product management, fostering engaging and insightful dialogue.
After lunch, we had a change of pace, with a panel discussion on the funding of tech in the profit sector. The panel, moderated by Archana Ramanathan of Dasra, featuring Sahana Jose of Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies, Parveen Sharma of Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and Rohini Kamat, Cisco CSR, shared insightful and nuanced perspectives on effectively setting up and funding tech initiatives within the social sector. This is an oft-overlooked aspect of successful technology set ups in the sector, and this panel discussion provided valuable insight to tech leaders on how to think about funding proposals, and what decision makers on the other side of the table may look at to evaluate these proposals.
The event also showcased demo booth stalls set up by 12 organizations, providing attendees with hands-on experiences and insights into innovative tech solutions driving social impact.
The objective of the event, aligned with one of Project Tech4Dev’s core goals, aimed to establish a network of tech leaders within the social sector and initiate the development of an ecosystem where NGOs and partners could offer mutual advice, support, and, in certain instances, collaborate on ambitious endeavors. Recognizing that this endeavor extends beyond the efforts of a single organization like Project Tech4Dev, it was heartening to witness the enthusiastic participation of numerous individuals in ensuring the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact event.
In conclusion, the success of the inaugural Tech4Impact event underscores the collective commitment and fervor of individuals and organisations striving for meaningful change. As we reflect on this milestone, let us renew our pledge to foster collaboration, ignite creativity, and drive impactful change together. Here’s to the ongoing success and expansion of the Tech4Impact community!Title: Building a Big Feature
Author: Rohit
Date: April 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/building-a-big-feature/
==================================================

About a week ago we launched a big feature, what we’re calling UI for Transformations. This was the most ambitious feature we’ve built so far for Dalgo and I’d like to share some reflections on what went into it.
The seeds of UI4T were planted last September when we started building out our
dbt-automation
repo. At that time the goal was simply to be able to generate dbt models by specifying a JSON or YAML config in a text file, in a warehouse-independent way.
A new feature
In October the team met in Kochi and started thinking about creating a visual frontend for defining transformations, and dbt-automation was well placed to provide backend support. We would be able to design HTML forms for each operation, and pass these configurations to the dbt-automation library to generate the dbt SQL models.
But… this is not a complete feature spec, and we started thinking about what else we wanted to provide to give our users a visual data transformation experience. We started looking at tools, like dbt Cloud, Alteryx, and AWS Glue. We started listing the features they provide, who their user bases are and how those users map to ours. At our end, do we plan a feature for our current users who know SQL, or for our future users who won’t? Is our goal to move dbt Cloud users over to Dalgo to create their models, or to let them operate in their current style unhindred? Should we provide a SQL editor in the browser, complete with syntax highlighting and source control?
A data driven approach
We next went through a detailed exercise of listing from our existing dbt projects which SQL operations were used and how often. We created a Google Sheet whose columns were different SQL operations (JOIN, GROUP BY, PIVOT etc) and whose rows were the 235 individual dbt models from across 9 client projects.
Exercises like this can inform your decisions and help you defend them when asked why you chose to go a certain way, but they don’t make the decision for you. In this case there was an unintended side-effect: since everyone we spoke to about their dbt experience was (by definition) an advanced user, we found our design mindset leaning towards designing for them. Which of course begged the question – is our goal to get them off VSCode and dbt Cloud? (And if not, who were we building for?)
Minutes from one of our meetings in November
Who is the user?
A feature like can always be designed for whichever class of user one wants to target, and we first chose to target users who know SQL. We had in mind a code-editor, a connection to their GitHub repo, a visual model lineage graph, and a console for logs. GitHub integration was a big one – we would need them to “log into GitHub” from the Dalgo UI, so that their commits and PRs would appear under their name. We talked about implementing code review in the UI which would map to comments on PRs in GitHub. We talked about having separate roles in the NGO for code writers and code reviewers, and we talked about support for multiple branches and sandbox environments.
Our first proposal to management in December
Here’s something I’ve learned – it’s hard to design for your user base when you have less than 10 customers. This is even more true when you’re designing a feature which they may not even use. Do you design for future users who are “like them”? Or do you design for users who you know are out there but you don’t know that they’ll be onboarded anytime soon?
How do you design for novice users when nobody on the design team is a novice?
Picking the target user base
If you’ve seen the feature, you know that we eventually decided to build for non-SQL users… this was finally decided sometime in February. Code editor? Out. GitHub integration? Also out.
Instead we built a visual workflow designer via which a user would define operations on their data, typically starting from ingested tables and gradually making them ready for reporting.
(And what do these “operations” look like? Well, they look like SQL… there wasn’t any getting away from that)
Once this was finally decided, we got UI designs from Think201 and quickly started implementing. Since the Dalgo team had already spent enough time on this project our deadline was tight, and a few things we did which we will definitely avoid doing in future are
building while the designs were still fluid
pushing out incomplete functionality to unblock other incomplete functionality
eventually “borrowing” a developer from another team
roping in non-developers to test what developers should have tested
Lessons learnt
Yes, lessons were learnt and learnings have already been put into practice. A win which every team member has appreciated is the move towards using a fixed format for writing product specs, and using these to drive UI design and engineering specs. Sometimes these stages will overlap but as far as reasonable we aim to do them in this sequence.
But we still struggle with our fundamental question: Who is Dalgo for?Title: Building a India and District Metric Map on the Superset Dashboard
Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: March 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/building-a-india-and-district-metric-map-on-the-superset-dashboard/
==================================================

One of our client requirements wanted to see if it’s possible to show India’s District level information on the map. We took a bit of time to research about this and came up with a solution to make this possible on the superset dashboard.
Superset dashboard offers deck.gl polygon which uses deck.gl library which you can read about
here
. The way I approach this problem is to get the shape files for India and District level information so I had to do a lot of googling on this and finally came up with a couple of shape files which provide close to accurate borders on both state and district level. Which we started maintaining
here
needs a bit of structure but gives us what we want. So now I’ll walk you through the process of what we did.
Step1:-  Get the Data
First get the data which has district and state level information. We started working with ATECF this time and they’re collecting data from Avni in different state and district parts of India. They wanted to show a couple of metrics on both levels. So we had the AVNI data which gives data at two different levels.
Define spatial dimensions for county visualizations
In our database, we will first create the PostGIS extension that will allow us to manipulate geospatial data:
In order to visualize the data in Superset, we need to define each county’s spatial dimensions in either a GeoJSON, a
Polyline
, or a
Geohash
format. This can be done by determining the correlation between each GeoJSON and each county’s FIPS so that we are able to enrich our results table in Superset.
Most of the time, geo datasets can be found in the form of
shapefiles
.
A shapefile is a vector data format used for storing data that references geographical objects. These files must be converted into a format that your database can read before it is stored and queried.
A shapefile is commonly downloaded as a single .zip file that, once unzipped, contains three mandatory files with the prefixes .shp, .dbf, and .shx:
.shp: Contains the geographical data, which includes points, lines, and polygons.
.dbf: Contains non-geographic features and attributes that describe the data.
.shx: Contains indices of the record sets in the .shp file for quicker lookups.
Create Extenstion postgis;
Next, we need to install GDAL, which is a library used to convert shapefiles to GeoJSON.
If you’re using a Mac, then you can install GDAL using Homebrew:
Brew install gdal;
We are now able to convert our
India district shapefile
india_district.shp into a .sql file for ingestion by Postgres:
In the terminal, type:
ogr2ogr -nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI -f PGDump -t_srs "EPSG:4326" india_district.sql india_district.shp
This command will give you the sql dump file at your given path. Then you will have to upload this to your database which will give you something like this.
As you can see here it gives me the coordinates for district and state level.
Step2:-
Convert wkb_geometry to GeoJson data type
In this step we need to transform the wkb_geometry column from a geometry data type to a GeoJSON data type. So you’ll need to write a sql query for this which I’m mentioning here
CREATE TABLE state_jeojson AS (
SELECT st_nm, json_build_object(
'type', 'Polygon',
'geometry', ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Transform((ST_DUMP(wkb_geometry)).geom::geometry(Polygon, 4326), 4326))::json)::text as geojson
FROM public.indian_states);
After this, Once this convert to geojson column then I have merged that with the ATECF data where the state and district columns are same and that gives us corresponding polygons we want.
Once the table is ready we do following things
In superset we have deck.gl polygon and we select polygon column in our case which was
state geojson column. Then next choose, Polygon Encoding as a JSON.
Then we select the metric we want here I’m calculating number of Dams at state and district level.
We’re using mapbox key to make it nice UI for the map.
We need to enable javasrcipt tooltip generator to show the metric on the dashboard upon hovering
Drill to detail option is available on the map so you can get more information about the particular area.
At the end this is how the dashboard looks like
This is how I’m showing district level information
State level Information
Challenges
We need to fix the tooltip to show better information on the map.
To show multiple metrics on the map. Right now I can only do it for one.
Drill down is not possible on this map so we’re doing filtering on both the maps
We’re hoping to solve most of these problems in our next sprint which is happening on 31st to 6th in Bangalore.Title: COVID-19 Reflections – 6 weeks in and counting
Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

It has been more than 6 weeks since San Francisco and the Bay Area went into lockdown and more than 5 weeks since India did the same. Both regions have still close to 2 weeks remaining of the lockdown, assuming it is not extended. Here are a few thoughts and comments on how things are coming along, both from a Project Tech4Dev perspective and The Chintu Gudiya Foundation perspective.
In both cases, we have been proactive in reaching out to all of our partners, including our NGO partners, and listening to them and the issues they are facing. We’ve also sampled NGOs across the spectrum from relatively small NGOs to mid-sized NGOs all across India.  It’s interesting to see the different ways organizations are dealing with the virus and its impact. Its been an interesting and busy two weeks speaking to 20+ organizations.
Our primary goal in these calls was to listen to what the partners had to say and to offer Tech4Dev’s help and support in the short to medium term. From the Chintu Gudiya Foundation perspective, we are offering quick grants to all of our grantees that are involved with COVID-19 relief work in India.  Our Tech4Dev mandate does not allow us the same flexibility (for all the right reasons), but we can and will do what is needed to help all our partners. We are also encouraging all our partners to think about their staff’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being.
For our non-Indian readers, a bit of background. The biggest problem in India currently is the food shortage. Unfortunately, the less privileged are the most affected. One of the things that are the most gratifying to me personally, is to see how so many individuals and NGOs have stepped up and are doing food relief, especially for the migrants and day wage laborers. In a few states, NGOs are providing as many food rations as the government if not more. In case you are interested, you can read lots of great articles from our friends at
IDR
A few thoughts and comments from our conversations with NGOs and Partners
There are quite a few NGOs who have done an amazingly quick pivot and either is helping feed and protect the less privileged or have switched to an online model in the blink of an eye. We’ve been encouraging most of them to write down their notes and share them with the sector.
Some NGOs have decided to take a step back, give their staff a break (letting them volunteer in their local communities and relief work), while they figure out what to do in a post-COVID world. Most NGOs with field staff are in this situation, where technology was helpful but not as a communication mechanism for the last mile.
Most of the NGOs are kinda in the middle. Doing a bit digitally, doing a bit of relief work, and hoping things get back to normal, or the new normal sooner rather than later.
All of them are aware that their funding will decrease significantly primarily due to CSR funding going towards the PM-Cares fund, and companies not making a profit. On the flip side, not many are thinking of alternatives and how to deal with it. It’s a hard question to answer, and we don’t have too many ideas on this either.
Many of our software partners are starting to experience the effect of COVID with either cancelled projects and/or delayed payments. Our guess is this will get worse before it gets better. This also strengthens our argument on building and strengthening platforms during these potentially slow times.
A few collaboratives forming at this stage. This is super helpful and organizations are seeing the power of the many vs the individual. It is also very much needed in India, and I’m glad it’s happening.
Overall, as with any crisis, there are some positive things, some negative things, and a lot of lessons that we can learn and take forward. I do think many of our NGO partners now see the need for better technical infrastructure and systems within their organization. Many of our software partners are realizing the amount of time their staff spends commuting to/from work, and having work-from-home days is potentially a good thing.
Finally, all of us want this to be over sooner rather than later. We will get through this, and we will come out stronger than ever.

==================================================

The primary aim of the CRM platform project is to provide a ready to use development platform for the software partners for the CRM’ish projects. We are hoping it will save considerable time and effort involved in research and bootstrapping the project.
Overview
Currently, we have implemented a backend for this platform. Below are the details of the functionalities which have been implemented for this project:
Define and manage a set of contact types and details
Activity Management

==================================================

We were analyzing past Tech4Dev projects including the project in the last 2 cohorts and found that there were few projects which were CRMish in nature. Hence, we thought if there was a basic framework/tools/CRM app it would help and save a lot of initial work done by various implementing partners.
Hence, we had a code sprint during our face to face meeting in November to brainstorm and evaluate various options.
This was the sprint agenda:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ED-2krTAHHX92PvhXqeU-dkYdNaEJS_jw5Njym3VKg0/edit?usp=sharing
After experimenting with the various options we have shortlisted the following toolset to be used for projects in the next cohort that meet criteria.
Frontend: React
Backend: Strapi.io, PostgreSQL
We already have a few projects that fall into this category for the second cohort. So we will keep everyone updated here on the progress for the same.Title: CTO meetup: Building a new ecosystem for collaboration of techies of the social sector

==================================================

This Blog is written by Arun Kadekodi
Project Tech4Dev’s quarterly sprint for the current quarter took place from March 31, 2024 to April 6, 2024 at the Royal Orchid resort and convention centre, Yelahanka, on the outskirts of Bengaluru. This was a developers sprint, where the entire team met and had deep dive and brainstorming sessions on our multiple platforms and the FCxO program.
April 5, was earmarked for a CTO meetup (at Hotel Grand Mercure next to Gopalan Mall), where we had requested participation from CTOs working in the social sector around the country. We had an overwhelming response, where more than 110 registrations out of which, 90+ attended! This clearly showed the need for such a meetup!
Meeting Vineet Prasani (who is with Noora Health but was then with Social Alpha), Vivek Singh (co- founder of Samanvay Foundation), Swapnil Agarwal (co-founder of Dhwani RIS) brought back some wonderful memories of our first meeting for Project Tech4Dev 1.0 that was conducted in the offices of Social Alpha where Donald Lobo, Kurund Jalmi and I had met with them along with others like Arjun Khandelwal, Sunandan Madan etc. Looking at Avni (then called OpenCHS) and other brainstorming sessions we had at that time, probably shaped our thinking towards building platforms that served a large number of NGOs rather than working on building individual systems for NGOs.
Today, we look at our team of 25 working with 100+ NGOs and tech partners, with our platforms of Glific, Dalgo and the FCxO program we can safely say that somewhere our efforts towards building a thriving ecosystem have taken shape.
I think this CTO meetup is another such moment in our journey.
The day began with a wonderful icebreaker session where people were energized into participating with questions ranging from how likely you are to adopt stray pets to how likely you are in using AI in your work in the next 3 months
Donald Lobo and Erica Arya gave an outline of what was in store and how CTOs should make the most of this opportunity to meet the other participants and discuss how they have tackled their tech needs. Lobo also recognized the presence of the people with whose help, Project Tech4Dev started.
We did miss Kailash Nadh from Zerodha, who could not give the keynote as he was suddenly taken ill.
Aman Dalmia from Hyperverge Academy, set the tone of the event with a plenary session on the Status of LLM models in 2024 and how to navigate them for the right tools when using LLM for
social projects. As there are some practical challenges with LLM models in terms of quality and costs, he suggested use of Model merging for cost effective work output or using larger model (like GPT 4) to train smaller ones. There were also challenges of LLMs using Indian languages. He said that currently they are tuned to 9 Indic languages  and would grow further in number with time.
This session was followed by a session where 8 different topics were given and 8 tables for the same were setup  each being facilitated by 2 persons and the participants could choose a table. This was to promote discussions amongst the participants regarding their topic of choice. The first session was for 45 minutes, after which the participants had to move their next topic of choice and meet other participants at that table. This, by far, was the most popular session. In their feedback, almost everyone mentioned that they got introduced to CTOs from the social sector with similar interests or issues. In some cases, 45 minutes were not enough, so these conversations continued over lunch.
The meticulous planning done by Ashwin Srinivasan and Thomas Mampilly stood out!
The 8 topics were:
1. Using data and AI safely, securely and ethically
2. AI: Cutting Through The Hype
3. Thinking like a CTO
4. Product Management – from idea to impact
5. Working with Government on Technology  Projects
6. Building awesome tech teams at NGOs
7. Internal Tech Systems and Partners best practices and common pitfalls
8. Building in Open Digital Public Goods
The facilitators did a great job of provoking the participants to speak up and share their thoughts.
In the hall, along the sides, there were booths setup by several partners/vendors working in the social sector. It was more for informing participants about their products/services or the work they were doing, more than marketing or selling. Post lunch, there was specific time allotted for this and the participants went around these booths. The partners who participated were:
Goalkeep
Pacta
Civic Data Lab
Karanji
Impact4Hire
Aastrika Foundation
Tech4SocialGood
Nudge Incubator
DICEflow
Tekdi Technologies
Avni
EdZola Technologies
Dalgo and Glific
Then came the panel discussion with Funders. The funders who participated were Sahana Jose (Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies), Parveen Sharma (CIFF) and Rohini Kamat (CISCO). The session was moderated by Archana Ramanathan from Dasra.
Some of the topics discussed were
1. Varied approaches to considering funding proposals including the difference between corporate social responsibility groups in Cisco and dedicated funders like Rohini/Nandan Nilekani Philanthropies.
2. Funding for programmatic vs operational needs. It is possible to get funding for operational needs as long as the percentage is not too high.
3. How to pitch proposals so that it appeals to non-tech people – should tie to program impact rather than focus on technology.
The concluding session included a feedback from the participants. Some of the responses received
were
Some participants wanted more time, more depth, more focus:
1. Networking opportunities were good
2. Could such events be repeated more often during the year
3. How can the connects established during this be taken further WhatsApp groups, forums, can T4D help in setting up such groups
4. Can smaller focused meets be managed by NGOs locally, in person or online?
All in all, it showed that the need of such a group was felt by almost all participants and they
welcomed this initiative taken by Project Tech4Dev.
What started with that meeting six years ago can be seen in action today, in the social sector. We
are hoping that what started on April 5, 2024, will also result in a thriving ecosystem that will help
in harnessing the power of technology to drive social impact. Eventually, the smaller NGOs will
definitely benefit from the larger ones, where such programs are conducted locally, going ahead.
Finally, a shout out to Ashwin Srinivasan and Thomas Mampilly (who was sorely missed as he had to
cancel his trip due to his sudden illness) for setting up this entire program and executing it to perfection with able local help from Rajeev Mohan!Title: CTiS 2019 Conference

==================================================

CSpathshala
is a not for profit initiative under ACM India, to bring a modern computing curriculum emphasising on problem solving and computational thinking skills, to Indian schools. The mission is to prepare our students to participate creatively in the digital age, industry leaders and top academicians in the country are working together to bring a computational thinking curriculum for primary and secondary schools along with teaching aids.
CTiS 2019
, the first All India conference on Computational Thinking in Schools (, was held in Pune on April 20, 2019. More than 140 delegates which included teachers, Principals and Organizations working in the field of education from 20 cities and 7 states of the country attended.
Vipul Shah, Head of the CSpathshala initiative in his opening remarks said, ?Computing is touching our lives in more ways than before and we need to actively prepare our students for this new world. We started with a modest beginning with 15 pilot schools and have now reached 3 Lakh students in 750 schools across 11 states in three years. CSpathshala is increasingly becoming an enabler fostering a community of teachers, volunteers and partners and engaging students through various programs. CSpathshala also prepares students for competitions like the Bebras Challenge in Computational Thinking (
https://bebras.cspathshala.org/
) where more than 130,000 students participated last year ? and many of the toppers were from the rural and tribal schools!?
A teacher from a Pune school had actually come on stage dressed as a robot and demonstrated how a child interacted with this robot to give specific and clear instructions to do things!
The keynote session from Prof. Ramanujam from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences was one of the best lectures I have heard to date. He spoke at length about how we need to move from ?Silent Classrooms? (where the teacher keeps asking the children to keep quiet most of the times) to a class room that encourages argumentation, discussion between the children and letting them arrive at answers than simply dictating the answers to them. He gave several examples that directly connected with all the teachers and listeners alike.
CTiS2019 featured presentations by teachers from across the country on how schools are integrating CT activities with physical computing and mathematics. Dr. Anantha Narayanan from Coimbatore, who had come with several sensors and an Arduino board (Arduino is an open source electronics prototyping platform using which, children can design things) and examples of projects done by his students. Mrs. Manisha Girolkar from Pune also showed videos of some models built by students – like the model of a bus, where there is a sensor where every passenger getting in gets counted and every passenger getting out gets counted and based on that the door of the bus to enter opens to let new people in ?.
Some stalwarts like Dr. Abhiram Ranade (IIT Bombay) and the President of ACM India, Dr. H.V. Sahasrabudhe, Dr. Venkatesh Raman (IMSc) and the Vice President, ACM India, Dr. Madhavan Mukund (Dean of Studies and a professor of computer science at Chennai Mathematical Institute) attended the conference.
Teachers showcased how Sudoku could be taught with fruits instead of numbers, how paths in graphs can be used to find shorter routes to visit specific Ganesh stalls in Pune during the Ganesh festival, how following instructions can be taught by playing a Robot game, how algorithms can be used to minimize search space when guessing birth-dates, and how floor space can be effectively used to engage and train students on recognizing patterns.
Mr. Divy Thakker from Google India also spoke on CS First an initiative to teach programming to students. The event demonstrated that computing goes beyond the simple ability to use computers, and can be taught and discussed in schools without the use of computers.
A. Surendra, state coordinator, Andhra Pradesh Department of Social Welfare, shared that CTiS provided an opportunity to teachers to share and learn about the CT implementation from different schools from states across the country. Santosh Hande, Zilla Parishad School, Khed shared that, ?CTiS provided a platform for the Zilla Parishad teachers to share their experiences in implementing CT activities with other schools.? Asmita Mulay, Maths Teacher from School Of Scholars, Amravati said ?CSpathshala is the way to provide an innovation in studies with fantastic worksheets.? Pratiksha Majumdar, Meghe Group of Schools, Nagpur said that ?CTiS is the only platform for school computer teachers to interact with other computer teachers.?
One of the talks which struck a chord was from Ms. Premlata Shaji, who spoke about how she conducts the CT classes for children with learning disabilities. Many teachers contacted her for taking this up in their areas.
An activity was conducted for the benefit of other teachers. 3 males on one side, 3 females on the other with an empty chair in between. Males and Females have to exchange sides with each being able to slide in the opposite direction to an empty chair or jump over one person of the opposite gender to an empty chair. Everyone participated in guiding them and had a lot of fun and learning.
In her closing remarks Ms. Sonia Garcha said that Sharing is Learning and CSpathshala has been working towards creating a Community of Practice that provides a platform for educators to contribute, share experiences and resources as well as learn from each other and organizing the CTiS2019 conference is part of this larger process!
Teachers from rural areas told about how the parents of these children from a rural area were impressed with what their children were learning and they donated 3 computers to the school. One of the parents gave a donation of Rs. 5,000 (which is not a very small amount for that locale) to the school to buy a solar panel and battery for the computer, when he saw his daughter appear in the bebras competition (and that too Online!) ?. Such stories were a great motivator for all teachers and many of them who were not members of CS Pathshala, decided to join the programme.
The conference was very successful and teachers said that they look forward to the next one!

==================================================

Apply Now
Project Tech4Dev is excited to announce the launch of applications for the first half of 2025 of our Fractional CxO Program cohort. The program has been aimed at embedding seasoned technology professionals in NGOs for 3-9 months to help roadmap the organisation’s technology journey such that it is aligned with the overall organisation’s strategy.
While addressing the gap of the absence of a holistic tech strategy for the organisation, our learnings from working with NGOs over the past two years of the fCxO program include:
Lack of capacity at NGOs for technical product and project management,
An increasing appetite within NGOs to incorporate new technologies such as AI/ML to leapfrog across current gaps such as knowledge dissemination to low literacy populations through voice conversations,
Drive towards evidence based interventions and hence data becoming an increasingly significant part of the technology strategy,
A need for fast, agile pilots that in the worst case fail fast which is not easily done by NGOs and software partners.
Short term advisory and consulting needs on ongoing technology or data work
In our last cohort, we experimented with deploying a
Fractional Tech+Data team
, led by the Fractional CxO, to support NGOs with their technology and data challenges.
A product/project manager who can work with internal teams and external stakeholders to deliver high-quality tech and data projects on time and within budget + scope
An advanced tech team that can address and solve short-term, high-priority problems, build proof of concept prototypes with internal and external teams that will include experience in one or more areas including engineering, data science, AI/ML and UI/UX.
Based on the positive impact and feedback, we found this model to be highly effective in bridging critical gaps. Moving forward, we will continue to refine and expand this approach. This approach has helped organizations overcome key technology challenges by:
Addressing Capacity Gaps
: Enhancing technical product and project management capabilities.
Promoting Agile Experimentation
: Enabling rapid, fail-fast pilots to test and refine new solutions.
Driving Data-Centric Strategies
: Supporting evidence-based decision making and impactful interventions.
For a deeper dive and the impact of these contributions, check out our related blog posts-
Janaagraha
and
Gram Vikas
A few testimonials below on the value this program has made to the organisations we have worked with along with some of the organisations we have worked with over the last two years:
Given the nature of our work, and the fact that tech is an enabler and follows the objectives of programs once aligned with government’s focus, the FCxO program has helped bring clarity, prioritize efforts and help ask the right questions prior to investing further resources. It has also helped position tech at the appropriate level in the organisation which is important to strengthen our approach and propositions, including internally.
Sapna Karim, COO, Janaagraha
The Fractional CxO Program at Project Tech4Dev has enabled us to focus on the impact of our mission with the confidence of having a seasoned technology leader balancing immediate program requirements and long-term tech strategy and capacity needs. Every non-profit with a vision of aligning their use of technology to their strategic goals will benefit from the experience and expertise that the Fractional CxO Program provides.
Srinivas Krishnaswamy, CEO, Vasudha Foundation
How the Program Works
:
Once your NGO is selected, a seasoned technology professional will be assigned to work closely with your organisation. She/he will dedicate 12-16 hours per week to assist with various aspects of your tech transformation. Aspects worked on by a fCxO (each engagement is unique and will be shaped by each organisation’s needs and priorities) could include:
defining technology/data strategy and vision
streamlining engineering architectures and processes for already existing work
evaluating, selecting and working with  software partners
shaping raw data into insights using technology for collection, storage, processing, analysis, and visualisation.
assisting in capacity building efforts through recruitment and/or upskilling.
As mentioned above, short term needs might also be defined through the team concept but always helmed by the fCxO.
Expectations from NGOs / Our Selection Criteria
:
We ask that NGOs:
Have technology as one of their top 3 priorities
Can ensure active involvement of their CEO and senior leadership, especially in the initial month to set the direction and expectation for the rest of the team
Have a definitive organisational/program strategy and stable operational processes across the organisation
Have tech and data systems that are not in crisis; they are functioning, albeit with room for improvement.
Be willing to facilitate field visits as required by the fCxO
Application and Selection
:
To kickstart your journey, simply complete our application form, providing insights into your organisation’s technology and data needs, as well as your vision and plans. Tech4Dev will carefully assess all applications and select a handful of NGOs that align with our criteria. We will contact you within a week of filling out the application form to have a conversation and better understand your needs and timelines. We hope to be able to work with you to make a decision to do a go/no-go decision within four weeks of submitting the application.
Scale and Duration
Each fractional CxO typically works with 2 NGOs simultaneously, ensuring that their expertise benefits multiple organisations.  The engagement typically lasts for 3-9 months, offering sustained support and guidance.
Cost
Tech4Dev covers 1/3 of the program’s cost, while the remaining 2/3 is contributed by your NGO. The approximate cost for a half-time fCxO engagement (16 hours a week) is 1.27 lakhs per month.
Fractional Tech and Data Team models will be highly dependent on the particular needs and assessed on a needs basis. A couple of samples to evaluate pricing:
Product Management:
For an engagement that involves product visioning, developing strategy and roadmaps, end user use case definition and product requirements – fCxO (12 hrs a week) + Product Manager (12 hrs a week) : Approximately : 1.43L to 1.63L per month
MVP Prototype: For an engagement that involves creating a minimum viable prototype – fCxO (8 hrs) + Product Manager (4 hrs) + Full stack developer (16 hrs): Approximately 1.43L to 1.76L per month
Note a fCxO engagement over 6 months can involve a fractional tech team engagement only over 2-3months in which duration the fCxO time commitment will be lowered while other role resources help deliver.
We also offer substantial discounts to NGOs that share a common funder with Tech4Dev.
Work Location
Fractional CxOs work remotely but can travel for in-person meetings and field visits as and when needed and mutually agreed upon. Most fCxOs engagements typically involve a 3-5 day visit at the start of the engagement to better understand the NGO not just from a technology perspective but a more holistic organisational perspective. We also plan of two short visits of 2 days each during the course of the engagement. Your NGO is responsible for covering the CxO’s travel and stay expenses.
Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
Our embedded CxOs hold weekly check-ins internally at Tech4Dev to share insights and learning experiences, creating a collaborative environment. Tech4Dev leadership and fCxO team provides ongoing mentorship and support as needed. Fractional CxOs might also pull in another fCxO to assist in a specific tech or data scenario as they may be better equipped based on the expertise area.

Apply for 2024 Cohort
As we approach the New Year, Tech4Dev is thrilled to announce the opening of applications for the 2024 cohort of our Fractional CxO Program. The program is aimed at embedding seasoned technology professionals in NGOs for 3-9 months to roadmap the organisations technology journey.
We are inviting 3-5 forward-thinking organisations to join this exciting cohort, designed to empower your NGO’s technology, data, and tech strategy.
Our first cohort included 11 organisations – SNEHA Mumbai, Reap Benefit, Indus Action, Janagraaha, CEGIS, Lend a Hand India (LAHI), CORO, Aktiv Asia, Jan Sahas, SHOFCO and Bhansali Trust. The program has proven to be of tremendous value to the organisations as reflected by some of our first cohort organisations.
Vanessa DSouza , CEO, SNEHA – The fractional CxO Program has played a key role in helping us design and implement a technology strategy that is aligned to the organisation’s goals. We have benefitted from an enhanced technology platform ( open source , so lower costs) that enables real time dashboards and triangulation of data, to enhance our work on the ground. The fCxO Program has also helped build the technology capability of our staff with simple tools, which eventually enhances efficiency.
Tarun Cherukuri, CEO, Indus Action – If you are a non-profit or impact organisation looking to improve operational effectiveness or unlock the next level of impact through technology, fCTO program at Tech4Dev provides you the leadership talent to build your technology roadmap, build the requisite team for it and eventually build products that fit your mission’s impact needs. At the end of the program, we feel ready to absorb a full-time CTO and a full-fledged product team.
Sapna Karim, COO, Janaagraha – We were very clear we needed to strengthen our tech products and initiatives, and evaluate pathways to consolidate, partner and scale the extensive work done over the decades. The Fractional CxO partnership has been a godsend! It has brought in the much needed tech leadership, innovation, clarity and prioritisation, debunked the many old theories we held close and is right now helping us chart our course on the technology front towards the next decade of impact we have embarked upon.

We hope to be able to work with you to make a decision to do a go/no-go decision within four weeks of submitting the application.
Scale and Duration
:
Each fractional CxO typically works with 2 NGOs simultaneously, ensuring that their expertise benefits multiple organisations. The engagement typically lasts for 3-9 months, offering sustained support and guidance.
Cost
:
Tech4Dev covers 1/3 of the CxO’s cost, while the remaining 2/3 is contributed by your NGO. The approximate cost for a half-time CxO (16 hours a week) is 1.12 lakhs per month. We offer substantial discounts to NGOs that share a common funder with Tech4Dev.
Long term Support
:
Our commitment does not end with the CxO engagement. We are dedicated to supporting your NGO as it transitions to building its own tech resources or partnering with software providers. Well always be there to advise you when needed.
Work Location
:
Fractional CxOs work remotely but can travel for in-person meetings and field visits as and when needed and mutually agreed upon. Most fCxOs engagements typically involve a 3-5 day visit during the first two months of engagement to better understand the NGO not just from a technology perspective but a more holistic organisational perspective. We also plan for regular 1-2 day visits during the course of the engagement. Your NGO is responsible for covering the CxO’s travel expenses.
Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
:
Our embedded CxOs hold weekly check-ins internally at Tech4Dev to share insights and learning experiences, creating a collaborative environment. Tech4Dev provides ongoing mentorship and support as needed. Fractional CxOs might also pull in another fCxO to assist in a specific tech or data scenario as they may be better equipped based on the expertise area.
Next Steps for Your NGO
:
We are currently accepting NGOs on a rolling basis and plan to welcome a select group of 3-5 NGOs into our 2024 cohort. We encourage you to explore our

==================================================

Project Tech4Dev is excited to open applications for the
2025 cycle
of our
Fractional CxO Program
— a unique opportunity for NGOs to embed experienced technology leaders and tech teams within their organisations for
6 to 12 months
.
This program is designed to co-create and set the organisation on the path towards implementing a
tech strategy aligned with organisational goals
through our learnings across the sector of common and pressing gaps :
Limited in-house capacity for technical product and project management
Growing interest in
AI/ML solutions
(e.g., voice-based interfaces for low-literacy communities)
Rising need for
data-driven decision making
and strategy
Difficulty in launching
agile pilots
and MVPs within traditional NGO structures
Ad-hoc consulting needs for ongoing tech/data efforts

A Proven Model: Fractional CxO + Tech/Data Team
In our latest cohort, we piloted a
Fractional Tech & Data Team
approach — pairing a fCxO with a fractional tech team fulfilling roles of
product/program management, software development, data engineering/science, AI/ML engineering
to streamline execution.
The result? Agile, high-impact, cost-effective solutions leveraging existing frameworks but tailored to each NGO’s strategic goals.
What NGOs gain:
✅ A clear technology and data roadmap aligned with their mission
✅ Enhanced internal capacity for product and project execution
✅ Evidence based decision making
✅ Agile prototypes and scalable pilot solutions
Given the nature of our work, and the fact that tech is an enabler and follows the objectives of programs once aligned with government’s focus, the fCxO program has helped bring clarity, prioritize efforts and help ask the right questions prior to investing further resources. It has also helped position tech at the appropriate level in the organisation which is important to strengthen our approach and propositions, including internally.
Sapna Karim, COO, Janaagraha
I appreciate the “pilot first” mindset that the fCxO has brought to encourage more open thinking and experimentation.

How the Program Works
🧠
Expertise
: Your NGO is paired with a seasoned Chief Technology/Data Officer (CxO) (12–16 hrs/week) for 6–12 months.
🧩
Custom Fit
: Each engagement is tailored — from defining strategy to evaluating partners or building internal capacity.
⚙️
Optional Add-Ons
: Technology/Data/AI teams can be brought in as needed to accelerate prototyping or delivery.
NGO Eligibility
We’re looking for NGOs that:
Prioritise tech in their top 3 organisational goals
Active involvement of their CEO/senior leadership
Definitive organisational/program strategy and stable operational processes
Are not in emergency “tech crisis” mode
Committed to spending on technology towards enabling organisational outcomes
Cost Structure
We co-invest with
Tech4Dev covering part
of the program cost.
NGO contribution:
₹2 Lakhs/month
for a half-time (16 hours) fractional CxO + Tech Team (inclusive of GST).  The fractional CxO in coordination with the NGO will bring in tech resources as needed and manage the team and their hours during that time. For example, a rapid development of a prototype could have the fCxO contributing 8 hours/week and a senior tech resource (~5+ yrs experience) putting in 12 hours/week for a month, followed by the fCxO still at 8 hours/week + a tech resource (~3+ yrs experience)  at 8 hours/week and a project management resource (8 hours/week) for the next month as the project moves towards a full scale implementation with a vendor.

==================================================

Found myself hopping over September between the laid-back vibes of San Francisco, nature calls of Yosemite and the Redwoods and the non-stop hustle of New York City. It was one of those trips that had lots of stuff – the kind of travel where everything feels both connected and totally random at the same time. Here’s my musings of the trip on everything from outdoor escapes to conversations with funders and changemakers and of course AI (we can’t have a trip report now without it, can we ?).
It all started on the West Coast, where I spent a lot of time exercising and being outdoors. I had planned it to get a week of time doing a lot of stuff outdoors, before diving into my element of long conversations and meetings (not!), which I haven’t been able to do much over the last year. Lobo and Mari were amazing hosts and joined me on my hikes in Muir Woods and Yosemite – Lobo graciously allowed me to set the pace and thankfully I didn’t kill myself on all the hikes and indoor climbing we did over 5 days. The best part about doing this right after I landed was having no jet lag at all this time compared to my previous visit back in May – remember vividly the second day hiking down to Stinson Beach in the afternoon, getting some icecream there and feeling like I could just curl up and sleep but the steep incline from the beach on Dipsea trail woke me up and kept me up all the way for me to hit the sack at 9pm.
One of the highlights of my trip was meeting Hechin Haokip from the Centre for Women and Girls, Manipur and Manohari Doss from the Institute for Self-Management, Tami Nadu representing  the Rebuild India Fund. Hechin’s stories of the difficult situation in Manipur and the work they are doing in spite of that really stuck with me. To hear one – it took Hechin nearly as long to get from Manipur to Delhi as it did to fly from Delhi to San Francisco, all because of the internal strife back home was. There were more heart wrenching stories of running away from mobs, assault etc. Yet, when you hear her talk, there’s no frustration—just quiet determination. Felt like I was more upset and frustrated about the situation than her.
She’s been leading efforts to empower women at the frontline in Manipur; her points were simple but powerful: change doesn’t come from external forces swooping in with big solutions. It happens when communities, especially women, lead with dignity and resilience. Honestly, it made me rethink how disconnected we can get when we focus sometimes too much on big strategies and not enough on the actual people driving change on the ground. I think there is a space for both organic change within communities driven at the grassroots level and big strategy driven system change. Hope we at Project Tech4Dev can really push forward later this year on a circuit runner approach with local technology help guided by our Fractional CxOs to really enable these grassroots organizations to use technology to be more efficient (in whatever ways they need it –  be it in maybe website help, setting up efficient monitoring using Google Sheets, internal processes etc) – a way different endeavor than our current Fractional CxO program aimed at larger nonprofits with much bigger and more programmatic technology needs.
Our SF own
experimental funder-community building dinner
was an opportunity for me to meet some of Tech4Dev’s funders and quite a few other philanthropists in the Bay Area. Lots of questions and interest in the work being done by us and the other orgs at the event – SNEHA, Dream a Dream and the
Rebuild India Fund
orgs. Wish had actually had more time to talk to a few people that I was starting to have interesting conversations over but ah well there’s always another time when it is not so frenetic.
Dasra Philanthropy Forum
(DPF) in NYC was another whirlwind with all the panels and me moderating one of the panels on Tech/data fuelling social impact and also part leading a roundtable on AI and use cases in the social sector.  Not a lot of work – more of asking a few questions, shutting up and listening to folks such as Vanessa@SNEHA, Sucheta@Dream a Dream, Rebecca@Social Compact, Manu@Karya, Raghu@ARTPARK etc.
Between side events of UNGA, DPF and our own
experimental funder-community building dinner
, I found myself “mired” deep in sessions and conversations filled with fancy words. Kuldeep from
Reap Benefit
, who was also on the “panel” circuit, nails it in his
LinkedIn post
, “It’s all nouns and adjectives, but no verbs.” Lots of talk about strategy, but when it comes to action? Crickets. Sure, it’s exciting to be part of these conversations, but is there real value in these fleeting interactions with funders – does a line for funders at DPF with a lot of folks barely getting a 5 min quick snap session with a funder mean much? Honestly, I see the point that the funders want to see the faces behind their philanthropy efforts and have these conversations, but are we all just pretending these face-to-face moments will actually lead to something meaningful?
Of course, no trip is complete without a dive into Generative AI. Everyone and their dog/cat or hamster is talking about it, but let’s be real—how many people actually know details of what they’re saying? The roundtable at DPF with folks like Raghu from ARTPARK and Utkarsh from Adalat.ai was super participatory (way more than we expected that we were happy to dump the script) and we all agreed – there are real, meaningful use cases for AI, but not every situation needs generative AI or even AI. The challenge is figuring out where AI adds genuine value, rather than throwing tech at a problem just to feel innovative. It’s tempting, but sometimes the most impactful solutions are the simplest ones. Also, had a similar conversation on GenAI and other more debatable conversations on Tech4Dev’s platform/DPG model to IDInsight’s project based solutioning model with Sid from IDInsight during a 2-hour walk from Brooklyn across the Brooklyn bridge into almost Central Park.
On the flip side for GenAI, Thack (Empowerment Foundation), Erica and I had a stimulating conversation on what standards are we holding GenAI to especially as we look at Global South’s needs – where would we stack a GenAI based nurse assistant vs a pharmacist or a local doctor on the street who are likely to prescribe a course of antibiotics for anything ranging from a fever to cough/cold and/or diarrhea. End of the day for the people in these tough communities, would GenAI help or should we be holding it to the standards of the West and expecting accuracy levels that really are far above what they would be getting today from “trained” humans? A more controversial question but is very real and choices of solutions and standards we hold for these solutions have to really be use case driven and not hypothetical exercises.
So, after bouncing between funders, NGOs, AI panels, and personal chats, I couldn’t shake one question: Are we talking too much and doing too little? It’s easy to get caught up in the buzzwords and intellectual exercises. It is easy to talk about Dignity in a cushy room in NYC but how does that translate into action – was great to hear from leaders like Meenakshi and Anshu on what they are doing and their thoughts on how they work but hey how does that look like in the everyday real world for most of us – is it talk and panels to delegate action or is that how we translate that into everyday actions in the way we work and interact in the communities we are hoping to give and learn back at the same time?
Until the next post (Lobo would surely like me to write more blog posts and push for that), where I’ll probably question all of this again—but for now, I’m sticking with: shut up, get out and do more. A couple of  things for me to work on over the next 6 months –  Get my butt off Chennai and go stay with a few non profit communities and really learn from them. Work with Rebuild Fund and see if we can help enable the orgs that Rebuild works with through technology.Title: Change the Script 2020 – Trip Report

==================================================

The past few months has been a series of really amazing conferences, all very different from each other: From the BMW Leadership Forum Meeting to Sustain 2020 to CTS 2020 the past week. The theme of the conferences was radically different from each other: from building a strong support network and putting ourselves in a position of making a radical change in the world to the role and sustainability of open source ecosystems to how to make systemic change in the education systems and be active collaborators with the younger generation. The underlying theme across all the conferences was the power of the network and the strength of collaborations.
Art spaces, Dance, Writing were a core component of the event
I really liked the structure and format of the conference. The discussions were long (2 hours), which allowed deep, layered and interactive conversations. The audience was active participants during the whole session. There was a lot of writing, dance and play mixed in the various sessions. A huge tip of the hat to the facilitators: Sucheta Bhat, Chinnappa Das, and Padmaja Nagarur who really kept the energy levels high and did a good job of including everyone in the group. The conference was organized using the creative experiential model which combines experiential learning, group facilitation, and arts-based practice with assistance from
Partners for Youth
.
An informal panel discussio
My goals before the conference were two-fold: The first one was to get a better understanding of the space and educate myself. The second was to meet individuals and other NGOs working in the space. I met both the goals, and the conversations got better over the course of the event as people got a lot more comfortable. A few thoughts, comments and takeaways from the conference.
The conference did a really good job of integrating and highlighting the youth voice and making them a core and central part of the conference, which included a youth facilitator and a session run by youth focussed on answering some of their issues. I also loved the diversity of the attendees. It was evenly split between male and female, a good variety of folks from NGOs, school leaders, youth, government, and the consulting firms.
The amount of time dedicated to mingling and networking (meals and multiple tea breaks) really facilitated multiple conversations between different sets of people. I did make a concerted effort to sit with different groups of folks at different times. This helped me get a pretty good perspective of the participants and interesting discussions about the education space, the role each of them plays and their thoughts on the work and impact that Dream a Dream has on either the institution or individual.
I did realize that based on where you are in India, your family culture and upbringing, the expectations and pressures are so different. The youth (and many of the young professionals also), made the point about how family and society pressured them on the choices they did or did not make. This brings us to the main point, that while we think a large part of the system is government, schools and the external world, an equally important part is the social aspect and influence but there is not a lot of work happening in this area.
Reinforcing the above, one participant commented that it is easier to have conversations with third parties than within your own social network especially on topics like abuse, religion and increasingly in politics.
Probably due to the strong bonds between the participants, there was a lot of frank and open discussion where people did talk about their vulnerabilities and failures. It was nice to hear Vishal talk about his learnings and growing, and the evolution of Dream a Dream as an organization and its objectives and realizing the importance of collaborating and working with the larger ecosystem to bring significant changes.
I did not fully understand or grasp the end goal of sessions which were based on theatre improv and dialog. While the session did result in a pretty good dialog at the end, I was not sure if it was random chance.
My only minor complaint (and a totally first world problem), was missing really good cups of filter coffee. We were in the heartland of great coffee and I really missed a good cuppa
To summarize, I’m really glad I attended the conference. I learned a lot and made some really good connections. I walked away coming away really impressed with the amount of thought and organization behind the event and the amazing work that Dream a Dream does.Title: Changing the Narrative: Tech is a Solution – Tech is an Enabler

==================================================

This blog is written by Erica Arya, India Head, Project Tech4Dev
This blog should be a good read for people working in the development space, who think that Technology alone can solve the problems they have at hand, those who think tech needs large funds, big- scale and big organizations
Designing and developing tech solutions has been a major part of the work I have been doing. I always felt that tech tools and products being developed would actually solve the problems they were built for, but it used to surprise me when I would see that post integration into the programs, quite a few of the tech solutions were not able to create the intended impact.
On delving deeper to understand the reasons for this – talking to NGOs, understanding how they were implementing the tech solutions, having internal discussions within the team, it made me realize that the problem for not getting the desired results was not in the tech solution but in the approach. This made me change my narrative that Tech is not the Solution but an Enabler. Tech cannot solve problems by itself but can enable an effective, efficient solution. Tech is in fact the easiest piece of the problem to solve, the more important question for organizations who are thinking of tech for their programs is to ask yourself first if you have the processes and systems in place to support the adoption and execution of tech.
Delve deeper into:
Understanding the problem you are trying to solve,
Identifying the needs of your program,
What solution will solve this problem
Is there a systematic way of implementing the solution
If you have answers to the above and can see a systematic approach leading to problem solving, it means you are ready to include a tech solution which could enable an effective and efficient execution at scale. The size of your organization, having a large-scale program implementation plan, having large funds to invest in tech  these should not be the deterrents to get you going in such a case.
Once you have clarity that tech can help, do not think of building the solution in the first go. Spend time and effort researching and evaluating the existing resources, leverage existing tech forums and organizations like ours to discuss your problem and the possible solutions. Pilot with existing solutions, tweak it to meet your specific case and then evaluate if there is a need to build. In most cases the off-the-shelf solutions should suffice most of your requirements.
This is exactly what I shared, while talking to the grassroot NGOs of the Rebuild India Fund at the Dasra Philanthropy Week. Hearing the views of a few of the NGO founders whom I interacted with at the event made me realize even more that it is so very important to clear the misinformation around tech that many of the grassroot NGOs have.

Happy participants and trainers
Heading back home to San Francisco after a really good week of training with our third cohort of 12 NGO partners and the team from
turn.io
. Some folks have already posted their thoughts and impressions on different days of the event:
Day 1
,
Day 2
,
Day 3
,
All Days
. I?ll try and summarize the week and give a few of my high-level thoughts and impressions.
This was a collaborative event. Suleman at
Edelgive Foundation
helped us out with space and logistics. Prapti and the
Dasra
team helped us with the financials, Arjav and Rahul from
Lumen Consulting
took charge and organized the meetup, the Turn.io team delivered a high-quality program over 4 days, Anjali and Victoria from
Noora Health
along with Ayush from
Leap For Word
provided us detailed case studies and answered multiple questions from the participants. So overall a lot of people were involved to make this event happen and thrive.
For the 3 day training, we had approx 30 people representing 12 NGOs, 4 partners, and 3 trainers from turn.io. For the meetup, we had approx 35 people in the room representing 15 NGOs.
The days were structured to include lots of interaction, hands-on work, and questions. While the training was very comprehensive, an important side benefit was the conversations and knowledge sharing between the various NGOs about their work and use cases and picking up a few tips and tricks from the group.
To make our face to face time more productive, we did a fair amount of prep work before the meeting. This included completing most of the paperwork and legal contracts before the meeting. We coordinated via online calls via zoom, a WhatsApp group, an email group and a shared google drive to store all documents and collateral.
Many of the NGOs had to tweak their use case due to restrictions and/or design of the WhatsApp API. The focus on ?pull messages? being encouraged, and ?push messages? charges, ensured that participants had to be creative and think differently on how to engage their audience. A few of the groups definitely need ?WhatsApp group support?, but as of now this is still in beta and the API could change.
Lots of feature requests and comments on the turn.io platform and its capabilities. The platform has quite a good API and most of the entities within the system are customizable. I do hope that they build most of their extensions (like the NLU and Automation) using the API since it ensures that developers in the ecosystem have all the interfaces they need to extend the system to meet their needs. In general, we do require that all the entities and actions are extensible and modifiable similar to many of the successful open source projects out their with their plugin/hook architecture.
We do need to do some community building to ensure that folks share their use cases and as we move forward with implementations share their custom extensions using an OSI approved license. Having an extensions directory for all extensions along with documentation and tests would help the ecosystem flourish.
We had good open-source conversations with the turn team. From our perspective, it is important to ensure in the medium to long term that the code for such systems is free and open source. I think the problem is big and broad enough, that we need multiple companies and individuals working on to build and strengthen the system. The NGO world is wide and varied and we have lots of organizations with very different needs and requirements. Also, we can definitely harness the wider pool of developers in India (via Tech4Dev and others) and the rest of the world, and build a thriving community. In the short term, the focus of Tech4Dev is to ensure that the NGOs have a solution that works for them.
All the presentations and documentation with
turn.io on our google drive
, specifically the
question and answer session notes
. There were some hard questions, but we got good straight answers along with the reasoning behind what they are doing and why.
Getting NGOs to pay for part of fixed costs seems the right thing to do for Tech4dev going forward. It allows us to serve more NGOs, NGOs have a deep think if they really need the solution and why, and they come into the event with explicit goals and tasks.
This was the first time we did a cohort where there was a common tech theme. The interaction and knowledge sharing between the participants raises the question of: Can we find other threads across sectors and NGOs and run cohorts for future groups. I think we will get there, but I?m still grappling with the question of what are some common threads that we can build future cohorts on.
I?m glad we did the meetup. It allowed us to raise the level of awareness among another set of NGOs and gave us an idea of how much demand there is. Primarily Mumbai based NGOs attended the meetup, we did have some requests to stream this event but did not have the resources to arrange for that.
Overall, we see many of the things that we do in Tech4Dev as experiments. Our goal is to have a high success rate, but also realize that sometimes things might not go as planned. It will be interesting to see what pilot projects come out with our partner NGOs in the next 6 months and how this ecosystem develops, what percentage of NGOs move on to running pilot and then production programs and more. As always we?ll blog about how things are going on a regular basis.Title: Chat For Impact – Training Day 1

==================================================

This post was written by Arushi Wasan from
Dost Education.
It is always inspiring to meet one’s peers and learn from them, and this opportunity was recently presented to 12 nonprofits at the Chat For Impact accelerator – a 3-day workshop where nonprofits came together and worked on integrating Whatsapp into their social impact programs. Through this accelerator, each organization got a chance to further its work in the chat space, and build a cohesive and supportive community.?
The workshop was organized by Project Tech4Dev and was led by the wonderful trio from Turn.io – Pippa, Neelke, and Shaun. We kickstarted the day at 9 am and introduced ourselves to the audience in an interesting way – along with their name, each person shared a ?pearl of wisdom? with everyone else. Initially, most people looked stumped at the ask, but eventually, each person came up with heartening and encouraging stories and phrases. The crowd?s favorite story was that of a 6-year-old nephew teaching his uncle to not give up on a task too soon!?
Dost Education presenting its use cases
After the fun introductions, we moved on to learning about Turn?s work and discussing case studies of various social organizations. This session gave us an insight into the strong social impact work happening globally and sparked new ideas of using chat in our programs. And as no workshop is complete without some tea, we broke for tea after this session and spent some time chatting with our peers.
Post this refresher came one of the most interesting parts of the day – presentation of use cases. Each organization – armed with chart paper, pens and exciting ideas – spent 20 minutes in silence and wrote about their work and their plan for using Whatsapp to further social good. After this short brainstorm, each organization took 5 minutes to discuss their work with the audience. This was a perfect opportunity for all of us to understand the commendable work our peers were planning and doing. To state a few examples – Indus Action will build a chatbot to support parents in the RTE admission process; Dost Education will conduct guided conversations with parents of young children to enhance their understanding of early learning; and Digital Green will provide the right strategies, tools, and techniques to farmers. This session led to a lot of learning and most of us understood some new strategies and ideas to take back home.?
Pippa from Turn.io explaining Turn’s Product
In the latter half of the day, Turn further spoke about its work and stressed on the ?human in the loop? aspect of a quality chat – a factor each nonprofit will surely keep in mind. In this age of misinformation on Whatsapp, it is imperative to ensure that organizations don?t lose the human touch to keep the trust of their users intact. Eventually, we closed the day with some more tea and left the Edelweiss office with a strong grip on Turn?s product. We all connected with some old acquaintances made some new friends, and eagerly awaited Day 2 to dive into Turn?s prototype platform and bring our ideas to fruition. Big shout out to Tech4Dev for this wonderful platform!Title: Chat For Impact – Training Day 2

This post was written by Archit Verma from
Dost Education.
I recently got a chance to attend the 3-day workshop on behalf of Dost Education organized by Tech4Dev and Turn.io. The aim was to understand how we can make our conversations with our users more impactful and actionable. At Dost, we strive to create meaningful two-way conversations with our child caregivers and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn more about it. The event brought together a bunch of passionate problem solvers working on different problems in the development sector. It was my second time attending an event by tech4dev and I got a chance to catch up with a lot of folks again.
Jhatkaa presenting their use case
The first day had already set the expectations around the use case and we got to play around with the Turn platform. The second day was about getting our hands dirty and working on our use case. The day started with people catching up over breakfast and tea. After a recap of the previous day, all of us had a practice session where we developed a basic use case. The practice session gave us a clear idea of the possibilities of what we can develop using Turn?s platform.
After having spent time prototyping our ideas, it was time to focus on how to successfully make it available for our users. Pippa from Turn conducted a workshop on best practices on connecting users over WhatsApp, where we learned about the details of WhatsApp?s User Consent Policy. This session was especially helpful for me as I knew how to hold the high standards we have for our user?s privacy and consent.
In the session post-lunch, Pippa from Turn spoke about tracking metrics on Turn?s platform. I was delighted to know Turn?s pricing model is per user based and not per message based. This is very important for impact-focused organizations because a conversation could solve an issue with 5 messages, while others could take 50.  Turn?s built-in Goals and Behavior Setting capability is yet another fantastic feature that caters to the needs of impact-focused organizations that care about behavior change.
The last session of the day by Neelke was on the importance of context in a conversation and how Turn?s built-in Natural Language Understanding enables us to understand conversations better. We saw this through the example of  MomConnect, a South African National Department of Health initiative which aims to support maternal health through WhatsApp. Before using Turn, MomConnect used SMS and their staff was unable to handle the load of manually adding context to the conversations with their users. Turn?s Natural Language Understanding made this process easier and helped MomConnect tag their conversations automatically.
Neelke talking about how turn?s NLU capabilities helped MomConnect understand their conversations better
We wrapped up day two and with some more conversations over cups of tea. I had come into the conference with a few use cases in my mind to build with WhatsApp but I was unsure if Turn could help us with that. I was proven wrong, the two-day workshop left me with a bunch of ideas and a long list of experiments to try. I am thankful to Project Tech4dev for putting it together for all of us. Also, a big thank you to the amazing team at Turn for the workshops and all the help for allowing us to set up and understand how to use Whatsapp to help our users even further!

Turn.io
Three members of the Turn.io team recently spent a week in the bustling city of Mumbai, India. The main purpose of the week was to onboard 12 organizations to understand and use Turn.io. Turn.io is a web-based application that enables social organizations to have impactful conversations at scale. The heartbeat of Turn is to drive conversations to become actions, thereby providing evidence of the impact organizations are having. Turn provides access to the WhatsApp for Business API and applies a human-in-the-loop principle. Meaning you do not have to choose between a
fully-automated-but-often-impersonal-chatbot
service and a
very-intimate-but-not-scalable
service. At Turn, we believe you need a combination.?
We spent our three days with the third
Tech4Dev
cohort talking about all things “chat” and most importantly building hands-on prototypes to use WhatsApp for good. The third day also included
Noora Health
,
Leap For Word
,
Meraki Foundation
and
Digital Green
sharing challenges and victories on their journey to use chat for impact. On Thursday
Lumen Consulting
facilitated a meetup, with an open invitation to any NGOs interested in two-way communication.
The visit to India was made possible through a collaborative effort, initiated and driven by Project Tech4Dev from the Chintu Gudiya Foundation. You can read their thoughts and impressions of the week in
this blog post
, alongside some participants’ experiences of
Days 1
,
2
and
3
.?
So what were our key learnings from last week?
The development space in India is inspirational!
It is driven by a host of innovative and competent teams that are tackling hard social problems with relentless energy in the world’s second-most populous country. Being a small team ourselves it excites us to build a product to enable other agile and aspirational teams to amplify their impact.
Tracking is important.
It is one of the fundamental reasons why we started Turn – to enable impact tracking as it happens instead of at the end of long programmes. The more we know, the more we can grow in the right direction, making sure that resources are applied to solve the right problems in the right places. We love how committed the teams are to using data, and we are committed to building a data-led product. Small changes can change a lot of lives.?
Context is important.
To deliver scalable programs we need technology solutions, things like machine learning, natural language understanding, real-time two-way communication, and automation. However, to solve hard social problems we need empathy, creativity, and human connection. Listening to the participants? use cases we were inspired to continue to build Turn as a human-in-the-loop product. We believe it should not be a choice between a fully automated chatbot (which often results in impersonal and frustrating user experience) OR an intimate but small-scaled service. It needs to be an AND. It needs to be empathy powered by technology.
Community is important.
The synergy of peer learning, the inspiration of hearing one another?s stories, the motivation of collaborative problem solving all seem to strengthen when shared with others. Likewise, group functionality in WhatsApp is a critical feature for social organizations. As Turn we agree and will continue to advocate for the group functionality to move out of beta on the WhatsApp for Business API.
Our time in Mumbai confirmed the fundamentals on which we found Turn. It warmed our hearts but also reinforced our urgency to improve Turn even more. The need is clear and critical – the power of chat, of having a point of connection into almost every life in India, has to be utilized to improve lives! From a product perspective, we are committed to including more automation and more AI-assistance in local languages to help with repetitive tasks. We will continue to build Turn as an extendable product, and we will always advocate for community involvement.

==================================================

A quick update on our third cohort, the chat for impact cohort in partnership with
Turn.io
. We had 45 applications from NGOs across India. We used the following criteria to narrow down the list of applications
NGOs have to be doing work in India and have to be operational for at least a year.
NGOs that are already doing regular two-way communication.
NGOs doing periodic one-way communication with well-defined content and processes.
NGOs who are doing small pilot programs with their regular WhatsApp accounts.
We narrowed the list to 16 finalists and to avoid any bias issues (since we knew and had interacted with quite a few of the finalists), we asked the folks at Turn to pick the final 10. In the end, we picked 11 NGOs. The selected NGOs are
Reap Benefit
Udhyam Learning Foundation
Labhya Foundation
Dost Education
ARMMAN
(Advancing Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity of Mothers Children And Neonates)
Dharmalife Foundation
LeapForWord
Piramal Foundation
Indus Action
Antarang Foundation
Kheyti
We look forward to the training and a learning pilot program with the above NGOs over the next six months. We will post notes and detailed information on our blog and/or Google Drive folders to make the information accessible toTitle: Chat for Impact – Training Day 3

This blog post was written by Manish Manohar from
Saajha
Conversations have been the existential element of humankind. Right from being a tool for expression of information to elaborating feelings, conversations evolve us. With the advent of technology, the nature of conversations has transformed over the years. One of the influential modes being “Whatsapp” has reached a user base 2 billion! It has been at the forefront of changing how we communicate (Texts, voice and video calls) with one another.
Recently, I had an opportunity to attend a three-day workshop by
Turn.io
in collaboration with Project Tech4Dev. The aim of the workshop was to initiate discussions on how organizations can manage various conversations and problem-solving using Whatsapp.
Below mentioned are a few key takeaways I had during my experience at the workshop:
#Structured conversations
A conversation is by its core nature is personal. While we are using different channels to chat, we have to keep it in mind that chat should be personal, timely and actionable for it to create a social impact. A chat between two people goes through broadly three phases. These phases are the Introduction phase? Context setting phase ? Conclusion phase. Major changes take place between the introduction and the conclusion phase- this demands a structure to chat leading to more authentic and accurate impact analysis.
Structuring can be done via the following:-
Tags
: It isn’t feasible to deeper delve into the analysis of each and every sentence. However, it is possible to analyze broader categories of chat. Tagging key sentences into one category or the other would help to assign conversations and to trigger action.
Collections
: Collections are the broad categories for easy answering. Collections would enable a user to look at the chat more holistically.
Groups
: Groups can be used to organize people especially when the Human resources of the organization have multiple clients to look after.
#BOT versus human
Everyone (at least the majority of) favors automation.  Until BOTs are able to understand the intent of the human being it is not likely that they are replacing human beings in the process. Nevertheless, BOTs are getting smarter every day, with the utmost due credits to machine learning.
It is important to give a personality to your Chatbot. The personality of a chatbot should lead to behavior and action. The automated bot should be made based on how you would like another human being to treat you.
#Use cases
Noora Health
is committed to training patients and their families with high-impact health skills to improve outcomes and save lives. To ensure this they have integrated all technology tools IVR, SMS and Whatsapp to support mothers and families. WhatsApp support team ensures personalized support to all mothers enrolled in the program.
MomConnect
is a South African National Department of Health initiative which aims to support maternal health through the use of cellphone-based technologies integrated into maternal and child health services.
#Integration and Automation
WhatsApp API and
Turn.io
give an opportunity to broaden the impact of conversation with the help of options such as integrations with other APIs such as SMS service, IVR, etc. Automation of chats, Webhooks to augment or alter the behavior of a web page, or web application, with custom callbacks and fall back channels to ensure that the message is not lost with the loss of internet connectivity.
While For-profit sectors are reaching out to their customer through advanced modern technology platforms, a big shout out for organizations such as
Turn.io
and Tech4dev who are creating opportunities for Not-profits to create an impact at par with the former counterparts.Title: Chat for Impact- India Accelerator

==================================================

Over the past 6 weeks, we’ve been having talks with?
turn.io
?which works on 2 way messaging platforms (i.e. WhatsApp, and soon RCS). In collaboration with them, we would like to get 10 NGOs together as a cohort to help run a few pilot projects.
Lots of details and specific documents on our
google drive folder
. In specific do read the Turn documents to get a better sense of what we are talking about. A few things are different from the previous cohorts
Project Tech4Dec will fund approx 66% of the first six months. The NGO will be responsible for the remaining 33% and the costs after six months. The cost will depend on the size of the pilots. For the pilot, the cost will be approx 1L or so, post-pilot, it will be 3L – 5L for < 10K active users. More details and specifics on this soon.
We are planning a week together for the cohort from Feb 17 – 21. Location to be determined. The group size will be 25 – 30 people. If you know of a good venue or know of organizations that could host us, please let us know.
We expect each NGO to send two people preferably. At least one of them should be technically savvy. If you don’t have tech folks on your team, don’t worry, Project Tech4Dev will have software partners to pair with you. We will need to do a fair bit of work online before the meeting, so please ensure you have the energy and bandwidth for this if interested.
The primary goal is to have NGOs who are already doing regular interactions with their users (at least 5 messages/month) and want to make the communication two way.
The application form is
here
. Its a relatively simple easy application.
The deadline is Dec 30th
.
Topics that will be covered in the week-long meeting are:
Key topics that will be covered in the training are …
How to connect with your audience using the WhatsApp Business API & Turn.io.
How to engage efficiently at scale
How to guide users towards key behaviors using Machine Learning (ML) & Natural Language Processing (NLU)

Author: Deepak Nanda

==================================================

Having joined Tech4Dev last November, the Mahabalipuram sprint was my first experience of a community gathering with the organization. It was more than just work—a time to meet people I had only seen on Zoom calls, a chance to explore the humans behind the roles I had been interacting with, and to truly understand what the organization is trying to achieve.
The first day started with blaring alarms that my roommate had set (and didn’t bother waking up to). The shock of those half an hour’s worth of a gazillion different soundtracks made sure I got out of bed and moved out ASAP, forgetting the travel exhaustion from the previous day.
As the days went by, I had the chance (or rather, as part of my job and the plan I created) to interact with the Tech4Dev leadership, the team, Dalgo, and the NGOs that had gathered for Chai Pe Charcha and the FCxO and Dalgo sprints.
Talking to each of them not only gave me insights into how and why the organization exists but also a sense of what and who drives them toward the social sector.
Starting with the NGOs at the Chai Pe Charcha event and the
Dalgo
and
FCxO
sprint, I interacted with representatives from
Bhumi
,
SNEHA
,
Satya Special School
, and many others. These organizations, with their large-scale operations, were navigating the tech landscape to further their impact and streamline processes for efficient resource use. Spending the day with the FCxOs and the Dalgo team, they were able to shape their problem statements into simpler formats—making it easy to solve them with a line of code, AI, or even simple tricks using Canva or otherwise. This not only gave them the confidence to explore tech but also an initiation into its possibilities. Some even shared specific use cases of how Dalgo had cut down turnaround times for data visualization and ingestion in sensitive issues like domestic violence and maternal and child health. Others used it for better representation of their work to donors, providing quick insights.
For the FCxO program, these NGOs shared how the technologists became more like confidants than consultants—guiding them with solutions that were sometimes operational and didn’t even require tech or helping them build connections they never thought possible.
Moving on from these sessions (and rushing to find time with the team busy engaging with NGOs and each other), I managed to grab moments with them. The interactions from these catch-ups were as informational as they were soulful. For instance,
Devi
shared how her corporate and education background now helps her stay patient with NGOs and offer simple solutions to problems they see as colossal.
Antony
mentioned how his dream has shifted from wanting a fancy lifestyle, coming from the startup space, to now desiring a simple life of meaning.
Erica
shared that her journey with Tech4Dev has felt like the stars aligning each time, enabling them to work with the best people with the purest intentions. It was like they had all come together through some sense of a shared dream.
But that wasn’t all. I pushed myself (as I always do) to explore the city in the late evenings and early mornings. Mahabalipuram had a lot to offer, and for a travel enthusiast like me, it was a race against time to capture as many conversations and visit as many temples and beautiful places as possible. Every morning, I stepped out (thankfully without alarms blaring), exploring the serene Shore Temple by the beach, the Five Rathas, Krishna’s Butter Ball, and about 15 other marvelous stone carvings and structures. I also attended the annual folk dance festival organized by the government.
One of the guidebooks mentioned a trip to Kanchipuram (the city of Kanjeevaram sarees and the Kamakshi Temple), and I just had to make it happen. One evening, after work, I packed a small bag and headed to the city, planning everything on the go—from the hotel to the places I’d visit. The next morning, I woke up at 5 AM and made my way to the Kamakshi Temple, then rushed to Ekambeshwaram, followed by a Vishnu temple and the Chitragupt temple. I even squeezed in a quick 15-minute stop at a saree store to buy Kanjeevaram sarees (my mom was very happy!) before heading back to Mahabalipuram by 11 AM—just in time to not miss work.
With minimal sleep and a fulfilled task checklist, I packed my stuff and prepared to leave. That’s when a colleague remarked how it felt like we had just arrived, and now it was already time to go. Reflecting on his thought, I realized how the trip had been dreamlike—a transformative journey filled with temple runs, cherished moments with colleagues over German cookies (which were like bricks, but we still gobbled them up), and work that felt more like fun.Title: Cohort 1: Conversations with software partners
Author: Kurund Jalmi

Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/cohort-1-conversations-with-software-partners/
==================================================

Just
as we had had conversations with NGO partners this month, we also had feedback
conversations with Software Partners within Tech4Dev. As with the NGO partners,
these conversations too revolved around the software partners? experience with the
development projects being undertaken for the NGOs as well as with the Tech4Dev
process as a whole. Following are the key insights from these conversations:
1.
Resource expectations from the NGO partner
? In many cases, the NGO partner was unaware of the resource and time commitments from its side, leading to some amount of delay and time required for clarifications right at the start of the project. Lack of clarity on expectations ranged from the level of technical expertise or program knowledge required from the NGO POC to the structure of responsibility and decision making within the NGO?s management hierarchy and ownership issues.
2.
Responsiveness
: A frequent observation across projects was the reduced responsiveness from NGOs on conversation with Software Partners and also on collateral, data, and deliverable obligations. While the reasons for this are many and often understandable (lots of field work for the NGO staff leading to restricted access to emails etc.), this is something to be flagged and articulated at the outset for cohort 2.
3.
Need for more Tech4Dev facilitation
: In addition to more Tech4Dev involvement in project conversations and updates, required for cohort 2 is a robust escalation mechanism where both the software partner and the NGO partner would have access to escalation mechanisms in case of deviation from planned milestones and timelines.
4.
Software partners should talk to each other more
: In some cases where the partner interviewing the NGO was different from the partner finally implementing the project, the NGO wasn?t sure on exact division of roles between the two software partners. Would help if software partners exchanged notes in such cases.  5. Tracking impact of project post implementation and deployment: Implementing a tracking mechanism with appropriate indicators would be great for evaluating the success of a project from a social impact point of view in addition to successful implementation and deployment from a project management point of view.Title: Collaboratives similar to Tech4Dev

==================================================

After
Sustain 2020
, I was doing some research on
Funding for Open Source Projects
and came across multiple articles from
The Engine Room
and following various links and threads stumbled across The
Catalyst Project
in the UK. From their website:
The
Catalyst Project
is a UK collaborative to bring a social purpose to the digital revolution.
It is similar but broader to the tech4dev collaborative, so we can learn quite a few things from them and in the spirit of open source, borrow some of their documentation since the ethos and principles between the two projects is very similar, though at slightly different scales.
For folks, who are really interested in this and want to learn more, there is a broad collection of links at the bottom of this blog post which I?ve incorporated into the next few paragraphs at a fairly high level. Before I delve further, I?d like to thank the catalyst project and the engine room for making all their stuff accessible and transparent. It helps us in our journey and speeds things up.
There are a few different entities involved, and I?m still sorting things out: There is The Catalyst Project (incubated by CAST), The Engine Room and
The TechForGood Hub
. Not sure if the last entity is still active, but it does have some good resources.?
I?ll try to summarize and characterize some of my readings over the past couple of weeks, we hope to incorporate and adapt some of their below in our work at Tech4Dev
The Charity Checklist
– a checklist of things that a charity should definitely consider before proposing and/or going down a specific technology path. This is closely related to the article on
7 reasons not to apply for tech4good
, something which applies to all tech4dev applicants also. Its good to hear that their ratio of applicants that make it to the second round matches our experience.
In a similar vein of advice to NGOs, they also have advice to foundation and funders and have the
Funders Checklist
which is a good companion to the article on
Six tenets of tech4good
. Again, we share a lot in common with these principles but need to prioritize a couple of points that they make, specifically: User-Centered Design and Test-Driven Development and getting our entire collaborative believing in it and investing the time and resources on it.
On a different topic on our emphasis on listening to the NGOs with empathy and understanding, and getting to know them and their work better, the folks at the engine room, sum it up brilliantly with their article on
Supporting with humility
. In a similar vein, there is another good article on
How to make Charity and Digital Partner Relationships work
. We?ve learned over the past year some of the things they highlight, including face to face meetings with the NGOs, frequent communication and seeing the broader context of their work rather than attempting to build a point solution. I think it is important for us as a collaborative to realize that we can learn a lot from our partners in the NGO sector and we should listen a lot more, learn and build on their experiences.
Another common thread between us is the importance, both projects place on reuse. While we couch it more along the lines of the open-source ecosystem, they refer to it with a broader lens as seen in their articles on:
What is digital tool reuse
and
Talent, Tools, Data and Reuse
. I do think it is important for all of us to realize that reuse is not cheap in the short term. If we want to build reusable systems and try to foster communities around it (for long term success), we need to invest in it also and accept the fact that it might take a bit longer. However, the benefits of such things can only be seen in the medium to long term context, and patience is key
They have also built a fairly nifty tool (open source) to guide NGOs in their path to explaining their technology tools need with an interactive guide. You can read more about it and demo it at
Aligade – Interactive Guide for finding technology tools
and?
Aligade Demo
And finally, there is the brilliant
Duffers guide to tech4good
, which not only has a great title but pulls in many pieces together in a coherent way.
If you are still reading this, some more extra credit reading here from Nadia Eghbal:

Dalgo is an open-source project, our codebase is public and we are open to contributions from outside Project Tech4Dev. But it’s only recently that we have actually begun to receive contributions.
We are an active member of C4GT’s
Community Program
, and this month we saw several contributions from first-time contributors.
Show Docker tag and version of Airbyte’s connectors
. This was requested by one of our clients who has enough familiarity with Airbyte that they are able to read the documentation for the changes introduced between versions of the Airbyte connectors they use.
Fix the title in the Edit Connection form
. The title used to be “Add a new Connection” even when editing an existing one.
Tooltips for the side menu, and a new icon
. Our side menu was made collapsible via another C4GT contribution
in February
, and we received feedback that a tooltip on hover would be useful. We had also been using the same icon for Analysis and the Usage dashboard, so we took this opportunity to put in a new icon.
Show the correct source name in the connection form
. Our Connection form showed the type of the source rather than its name, this was fixed by this PR.
Fix the BigQuery configuration form
. This was a bug from July 2023 (!) which none of us had been able to fix… I think two attempts were made by two different people and neither managed to do it.
We continue to list issues with the C4GT community program and expect to see continued contributions from that excellent community.Title: Community Visit in Bhachau, Kachchh: Education at the last mile
Author: Abhishek Nair
Date: March 2023
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/community-visit-in-bhachau-kachchh-education-at-the-last-mile/
==================================================

On the 14th of March, 2023 Akhilesh Negi and I from the
Project Tech4Dev
team joined the
Dasra Catalytic Philanthropy
team on a field visit to Kachchh where we learned first-hand about the amazing work that NGOs
Jan Vikas
and
Unnati
have been doing in some of the most under-resourced and remote parts of the District.
While Akhilesh set off to visit the Jan Vikas team in Nakhatrana, I accompanied Shrutika and Sankalp to meet the Unnati team in a small village named Jangi, which is about 36 km east of the nearest city, Bhachau. Unnati has been working with communities in Kutch for over 25 years across
3 areas of focus
, disaster risk reduction, social inclusion and empowerment, and governance and social accountability. Unnatis overarching model of operation is that of nurturing and empowering citizen leadership. We visited
Jangi
to learn about their more recent programs in education.
At the local Aanganwadi we met with the womens group, adolescent girls, Anganwadi Karyakars and ASHA workers. We learned how the Aanganwadi is leveraged to connect with parents and assist them with Aadhar and
Mamta
registration. These are crucial first steps towards empowering the families in the area towards availing government services for themselves and their families. In this context a key challenge expressed was convincing the villagers of the benefits of the various Yojnas that the government has launched, the community is reluctant to pursue the due process for these yojnas until the value in it becomes very clear to them. Why?
The most vulnerable communities within this village make a living through daily wage labour, with the male in the family often migrating seasonally to locations where work is available. They are faced with the tough choice between continuing to make a living or losing a days wages to travel to the local government office with the hope that their applications will be processed. More often than not, multiple visits need to be made. Hence, as they should, they need to be convinced that the yojna/registration process is one worth pursuing.
Unnati collaborates with the villagers, the Aanganwadi Karyakars and ASHA workers to ensure that all documents are prepared properly with the help of useful checklists and filing systems. They also collaborate with the local government to ensure that due consideration is given to vulnerable groups when reviewing their applications.It was surprising to hear from the girls and mothers at the Aanganwadi that they all have access to mobile phones with an internet connection. Many of them even have personal phones, the Aanganwadi workers communicate with mothers and their children through WhatsApp groups. I wondered how useful a well designed
chatbot
might be in helping communicate the features and benefits of different Yojnas and to track their uptake.
Interaction with the womens group, adolescent girls, Anganwadi Karyakars and ASHA workers at the Aanganwadi in Jangi
Next, we took a 30 minute ride to Kantha Vistar. A village of only 10 households, located near the sea inlets from the Gulf of Kutch, the primary occupation of the villagers is fishing. On three sides the village is surrounded by bare land as far as the eye can see, with salt pans on the other side. The salt pans make access to the seas fishing grounds more difficult for the villagers, while the general remoteness of the area makes everything else difficult for them.
Through 6 months of engagement, Unnati was able to put up a temporary school in this village and arrange for teachers to come here and teach. The people in this village have never received an education, as the nearest school is in Jangi. Making the journey on foot everyday is not feasible, nor is there any mode of public or private transportation that could take all the children to school.
Kantha Vistar. Informal school structure to the far left and ‘mobile school’ bus to the far right.
The temporary school is a shed made of something like bamboo sticks, with a corrugated roof. It serves as a multi-grade classroom for the 30 or so children in the village. Of these, the older students, of 12 years and older, tend to spend more time out fishing with their parents. Over the past month or so, the students have started learning the alphabet and counting. The teacher here uses content created and shared by the Unnati team to facilitate learning. We were given a very warm welcome by the people of the village, who all came to the school and participated in discussion with us. It is heartening that the Unnati team has managed to build such strong collaborative relationships with this village in a matter of months.
Most interesting to me was the
mobile school
, which is a modified bus parked in the village that is supposed to serve as a classroom, full with solar panels, fans, and an internet connection. The government provides these buses in remote areas and hires a contract teacher to come and teach in the village. Unfortunately the village is too far away for a contract teacher to afford the daily commute and have anything left over for himself/herself. As a result, this bus has been in the village for the past 3 years, unaccessed. Unnati is bridging this gap by collaborating with the government to gain access to this bus and provide human resources from their own teacher cohort. This will double the facilities available to the students.
(See images of the inside of the bus and the informal school below)
We then travelled back to the beautifully designed Unnati head office in Bhachau for lunch and a meeting with the Unnati team. It was a pleasure to meet
Mr. Binoy Acharya
, founder director, who described Unnatis work in detail and told us about the organisation’s development over time.
Over lunch we discussed Unnatis current use, challenges and goals with regard to tech. Unnati currently uses a paper based system for data collection and information distribution, this is followed by data entry at the Unnati Head office.
Following lunch we gathered in a hall and had conversations around the Unnati model and the teams challenges. The team also took us through their MIS. It was inspiring to learn as Mr. Acharya discussed the Unnati model of Citizen Leadership and its development over time, starting with the time of emergency where civil liberties were denied to the people, through to liberalisation and globalisation of the 1990s and the Gujarat earthquakes impact and their innovation of of
owner driven reconstruction
. He went on to describe the large budgets allocated to various schemes like NREGA and the importance of ensuring their utilisation through citizen leadership.

As always, I am grateful to the Project Tech4Dev and Catalytic Philanthropy teams for the opportunity. It has broadened my view on systems for social impact and deepened my understanding of some the realities on ground. Looking forward to learning more about powerful initiatives like this one.Title: Community at Agency Fund <> Tech4Dev sprint

==================================================

As a Tech4Dev team member, most of the sprints that I have attended have left me with a lot of energy, inspiration, and empathy. This was exactly like that and a bit more amplified.
This time we met in Bangalore at a secluded location away from the bustling life of the city. In collaboration with the Agency Fund, this sprint was organized to run in two tracks.
User Engagement track – An overarching aim was to help organizations in the journey of their program -> funnel -> metrics -> visualization. Also enable cross learning and collaboration along the way.
LLM track – The aim here was to understand where the organizations are in their LLM journey, what problems are they currently facing, enable cross learning and leave them with some knowledge about new tools/information/advances in the field AI/LLM (although we (Tech4Dev) learned more from them to be honest).
What I liked most about the sprint was the collective skill set and the humble curiosity of the group present there. I got a chance to interact with Product Managers from various NGOs, UI/UX consultants/practitioners from Agency Fund, Strategy consultants and various Data/Software engineers. Most of my conversations with these people had a single goal which was to listen, learn from their journey/experiences and understand the problems they face in running their programs.
Yuxi’s (UX consultant from Agency Fund) session on How UX creates impact was something that just clicked, maybe it was the simple/elegant presentation she made or the way she explained it. I can’t seem to forget the 3 principles behind impactful UX. She had a case study to explain/show each principle being applied in action
Solve for the root problem (
case study
)
Reduce Friction (
case study
)
Care for details (
case study
)
Another interesting session/workshop on Merging, was by Stanslaus (ML engineer at
Jacaranda Health
). Merging models refers to the technique of combining two or more LLMs into a single model. This is particularly helpful, when we want to preserve/restore characteristics from each model. We did this using a tool called
mergekit
. And this method doesn’t require any GPU.
Ashwin’s (fCxO at Tech4Dev) session on Safe & Security in LLMs/AI was very thought provoking. A new term that I came across during this talk was LLM guards (one example he mentioned was
llama guard
). There are many tools out there that can guard your LLM application to make sure every request & response doesn’t have anything malicious/rude/unethical going in or out.
One of my highlights was to hear the journey of Udhyam’s Founder (Mekin Maheshwari). How he went from Yahoo (where we met Lobo) to Flipkart to mid-life crisis you could say where he posed questions on the meaning & his purpose in life ,to researching about the problem statement and to finally starting Udyam. Being from a tech background, Udhyam didn’t have any tech intervention in their first 4 years, which came as a shock to me. His reasoning was to first understand the problem, work on the ground and validate their model before moving to scale with tech.
I had the opportunity to take two sessions during this sprint. One was with the user engagement track, where I presented a case study about how Dalgo helped The Apprentice Project to set up & visualize their engagement metrics. I was definitely nervous and out of my comfort zone here since it had been very long since I presented something in front of such an experienced crowd. In hindsight, it was a great learning experience and I will definitely incorporate feedback/shortcomings from this in my next talk/presentation. Another workshop I facilitated was on How you can create complex Agentic LLM workflows using
Autogen
package (collab notebook
here
). The format of the sprint felt like Un-conference because we all were learning and improvising as we progressed each day in the sprint. So I did a short course on LLM Agents the day before.
There were a lot of other interesting conversations and sessions that I had the opportunity to experience & attend, like
Noora Health
talking about their Observability stack built using
Langfuse
,
Kabakoo
team took us through their Mentor AI bot built by integrating OpenAI, Whisper & ElevenLabs and
Jacaranda Health
presented their LLM stack using self-hosted models specific to their local language.
Major problems that i could understand NGOs are facing in implementing LLMs are monitoring their stack, refining prompts (Edmund’s (from Agency Fund) session on this was super useful) & iterating on it quickly, observability (cost incurred, tokens used etc), issue with native/local languages and scaling the deployment, how to reduce cost when scaling.
I am very excited to take all the learnings back, rethink about the problems faced by the NGOs, brainstorm, validate and see the viability of a LLM platform/service that we could potentially build at Tech4Dev.Title: Community is the key to success for any Language/Framework

==================================================

As the title suggests, I am also a very strong believer in this thought. When you start learning a new language or a technology the one thing you need is a strong community around it. The documentation of the technology and other things helps but you solved the most real case issues via discussion with your community and learned more about it.
When I started working on
Glific
(an Open Source project which helps to NGO in two way communication) I needed to do a lot of experiments with Elixir and Phoenix. The documentation of both the tech stack is fairly easy to understand but there were some issues that I put on the forum and got resolved and got a deeper understanding about them.
As my mentors say, if you are taking help from the community its your prime responsibility to give some help back to the community as per your capacity. So while working on the project I found some areas on a few packages where we could contribute. So we worked on them and created the PRs on the go. Some of them got approved and some did not :), But the experience is really good there. I also joined some open-source platforms and discussed the problems there and so far I am happy with my contribution.
Participating with the community not only makes a difference to the people being served, but it also helps to enhance work-related skills, builds good references in regards to community involvement, and provides a forum to network with so many experts and great people. And of course, it helps to develop civic and social responsibility skills.
As I am growing more in the elixir field with the elixir community I am hoping that I will be able to contribute more in it in the future and build some more useful ideas/libraries for the community.Title: Continuous integration & deployment for open source project

==================================================

?TO ERR IS HUMAN? ? It is natural for human beings to make mistakes.
Though it sounds ideal, you cannot (or must not) accommodate mistakes when people?s lives may depend on your software. Especially where users are interacting with your app in real-time and your code impacts their lives, errors must be minimized.
How to do that? Automation.
This is where Continuous Integration and Delivery comes into the picture. Taking the example of the open-source two-way communication platform where the
ColoredCow
team is building CI/CD into the development process, I?ll share my story on how CI/CD has started to streamline processes and foreseeing errors.
Before diving into tech, let?s take a quick yes/no quiz:
When you?re leading or in a team of more than 2 people, have you encountered a situation when out-of-blue existing features start to fall apart?
Are you getting feedback from your client instead of your testing team?
Is someone from your team assigned to deploy the new version of your software to the server(s) on a regular basis?
If any of your answers are yes, this post is definitely for you and your team. If you answered no to all, either you?re yet to reach these situations or are already doing a great job. In any case, I hope you get more insights into making your processes smoother.
Continuous Integration (CI)
CI brings in automation to test-case execution and verifies the system stability when code changes are pushed by anyone. For this project, we implemented CI using
GitHub actions
.
Continuous Deployment (CD)
CD, on the other hand, makes the release process smoother and avoids human errors when a new version of your software is going live. We are using the
AWS infrastructure
for automated releases.
Since the project development hadn?t started yet, I had a lead time to experiment and set up a robust foundation with CI/CD processes.
Process for CI
I started out with setting a simple roadmap:
Configure the application for automated testing. This includes research on how the Phoenix framework supports it.
Write some example test cases and try running them manually.
Write test cases for a small use case.
Continuous Integration – Use GitHub Actions to automate the test cases execution
Set proper alerts/status to keep track of the state of the application
Getting started in the Phoenix framework was straightforward. The framework supports writing test cases out of the box and has a
good documentation
.
Next, to run these test cases using GitHub actions, I created a
ci.yml
file that will tell GitHub to execute the test cases every time a developer pushes his/her code changes.
Have a look at
ci.yml
Now after some cleanups and fixing errors, I created a feature branch and? Voila! GitHub actions have started triggering on code push.
Process for CD
The roadmap for Continuous Deployment was as follows:
Dockerize the Phoenix application.
A docker-based setup will help for the easy installation of the application on any machine. Be it an AWS Linux instance or a Windows laptop. If you want to read more on dockerizing your app, give
this article a read
.
Setting up an
AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment
with support for Docker.
Setup AWS Code Pipeline that?ll deploy the code from GitHub to our Beanstalk environment whenever the master branch is updated.
For dockerizing the app, I created a Dockerfile that defines the platform dependencies for the project. When you run
docker-compose run
, it creates a container with all the installations mentioned in the Dockerfile.
Have a look at the
Dockerfile
Next, the Dockerrun.json file needs to be created that will be executed to deploy the docker image to our Elastic Beanstalk setup.
Finally, setting up
AWS CodePipeline
. Here are the configurations I used:
Source
GitHub repository for the project. Webhook for the master branch.
Build
AWS CodeBuild that installs the application on an Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Deploy
Pushing compiled code from ECR to the dockerized Beanstalk environment.
Whenever the master branch is updated, AWS triggers the CodePipeline.
Once CodePipeline execution is complete, we can do a quick health check of our Beanstalk environment.
Final thoughts
Having the automation in place, clearly, the time-to-market is reduced and the team will ship quality code. This is happening as the errors are being detected early on.
On top of that, setting up the CI/CD early in the process ensures the following things:
It?ll be an integral part of the Software Development Life Cycle setting up the right from the beginning.
Implementing it later comes with a high effort and cost is always a pain.
With proper test coverage, the foundation will be strong. Minimizing rework.
When a new developer joins in, they are more likely to code buggy pieces due to lesser domain knowledge. Having test cases will ensure that the system remains stable at all times and we detect these breaking changes early in the process.

Here?s how a chat platform can improve humanTitle: Conversation with Software Partners
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: September 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/conversation-with-software-partners/
==================================================

As we grow as an organization, we discover new things, which means we also iterate and improve on the way we do things. Based on our previous conversations with our NGO Partners (
here
,
here
and
here
), Rahul (from Lumen Consulting) and I figured we should also talk to the software partners individually and get their thoughts and opinions.
We spoke to all 6 of our current software partners this week. We structured the conversation using a
set of questions
that we invited them to think about before the call. We also asked them to use those questions as a guideline and just talk about their experiences to give it a better flow and get them talking about the issues rather than answering each individual question. As with the NGOs, we kept out interruptions to a minimum and only asked a few clarifying questions.
Rahul will do a detailed post based on the notes he took and specific action items from the conversations. I’ll just give a few of my thoughts and observations and some changes I think we should make going forward. Overall, I do think that  our group of partners have been amazing and a really solid group of companies and individuals for us to begin this journey with.
We need to improve on our communication. In the first cohort, we should have done a better job explaining to the NGOs  who we are, what we do and how we do it. Having an introductory webinar/physical meeting with the NGOs before we start the project is important.
We need to give NGOs a better sense of who is responsible for what, what the partner or Tech4Dev expects the NGO to do, and what our commitments to the NGO is. In the first cohort, Tech4Dev did not really engage with the NGOs and this needs to change.
We need to improve our on-boarding process for new partners and have some documents that they can read and refer to if and when needed. This is a work-in-progress and we do hope to get better and more structured with future partners.
Responsiveness among all participants was a recurring theme. Our current model assumes that we will wrap up a project in 6 months and move on (but continue providing support and bug fixes as needed). This also means that NGOs need to have the resources to pay attention to the project as well as drive the project to a state that satisfies their needs and requirements.
Overall, the relationship between the software partner and the NGO has been good. Both do grade the relationship approximately at the same level ( the average and median grade was a B, there were very few A’s and very few D’s. A being the best grade and D being the worst). Both NGOs and partners did feel that they were quite responsive most of the time.
In conclusion, I think we are at a good place. There are a few places that we can and will improve. At the same time, we also need to be pleased that many things are working quite nicely and quite a few of our initial assumptions have been validated.Title: Conversations That Stick: Month long notes from the Road

This feels more like a follow-up to
this blog
rather than just a post about a sprint. It’s more about the people I met and the conversations that stayed with me.
Yup, that’s the view from my place
As I mentioned earlier, I usually work from my hometown, Pauri—a quiet hill station in Uttarakhand far from the chaos of city life. I like it that way. Slow days, plenty of time to focus, and space to do what makes me happy.
Lately, though, I’ve been taking longer trips—spending a month or more away from home, heading south for sprints, work, and meeting NGOs and new people.
This trip was similar. It started with the Glific + AI sprint in Mahabalipuram. January is a good time to visit the south—any later, and the heat takes over. That’s how we landed on this spot after an amazing sprint in Shillong last November.
Nishika and I co-wrote a blog about the sprint here:
Adopting AI in the Social Sector – Highlights from a Collaborative Sprint
During this sprint, we also focused on planning v1.0 of the AI platform. A lot of discussions happened with our newly formed AI team at Project Tech4Dev—me, Nishika, Jerome, Sourabh, and Lobo. Since the team is new, we’re still figuring out dynamics—how everyone, with their different backgrounds, can contribute to getting this platform up and running.
We’ve made progress since then, and the
AI Platform repo
is shaping up. v1.0 should be out in the next few months.
During the sprint, I had a long chat with Nithun and Himani from TAP about their plans to use Frappe and AI to automatically review and rate student submissions. The goal is to provide feedback that helps students develop 21st-century skills.
I also caught up with Rajsekhar from
Digital Green
. We first met at the Bangalore sprint with
Agency Fund
back in August. It was inspiring to hear about the work Digital Green is doing and the depth of knowledge he brings. They’re definitely one of the forerunners in applying AI to the social sector, and we really look up to them.
After the sprint, I went to Pondicherry and worked from there for a week. I explored the beaches, Auroville, and the city, and I really loved the French architecture. It’s a refreshing change from most Indian cities.
Then, I headed to Bangalore, planning to stay for three weeks before the AI4GD conference with
Agency Fund
in March. While there, I reached out to a few NGOs we’ve worked with and visited
Key Education Foundation
and
ReapBenefit
. March is always a hectic time with the financial year closing, so everyone was swamped, and I didn’t get to visit as many folks as I’d wanted.
In the first week, I visited the Azim Premji Foundation with the Tech4Dev team. Met most of the team members from Bangalore—it’s always great to catch up in person.
Also met the Azim Premji Foundation tech team and Hrishi. Cool to see how they’re using Frappe for the Creche Management System and building an AI chatbot. The bot helps query documents by generating SQL based on a schema instead of feeding actual data into a third-party app—keeps things secure and compliant.
The next week, I visited
Key Education Foundation
and
ReapBenefit
.
At
Key Education Foundation
, I met Mangal, Swetha, Namratha, Naveen, Swarupa, and Sheetal. I know quite a few folks there—KEF has been using Glific for about three years, and we’ve crossed paths at multiple Glific sprints. Feels like an extended Tech4Dev team. Didn’t get much time to chat this time, but always good to meet in person. Will drop by again soon.
Met Kuldeep, Pooja, and the rest of the
ReapBenefit
team at their office—a beautiful space filled with greenery, graffiti of
Solve Ninjas
and
impact numbers
, and even a (currently dysfunctional) Solver Van(image in
cover here
), which I would have loved to see in action. A few cats wandered around, adding to the charm. One thing I really appreciated was their culture of sitting together on the floor for lunch, making space for real conversations.We had an interesting conversation about impact—how Glific thinks about it. As a WhatsApp message is just the starting point, the real impact goes much deeper. How do we help NGOs make that happen? No clear answers yet, but it’s something we’ll figure out together.
Big thanks to Ishan for hosting me—really grateful. Definitely owe him one when he visits up north. We explored nearby messes and cafes together. I always say I’m not a fan of South Indian food (dosas to be specific), but this time in Bangalore, I had the best idlis at Babai’s Tiffins—sometimes even twice a day. Also checked out Blue Tokai and Third Wave Cafe in HSR, where I got my first taste of the cafe culture—everyone with a MacBook, coding or working on product stuff and sipping cup of coffee. Felt like a whole different world from the usual WFH routine.
Couldn’t make it to the NGO office next week for some reason, but that’s a story for another time.
Next, I joined the AI for Global Development sprint in Bangalore, organized in collaboration with the
Agency Fund
. Easily one of the biggest and most diverse sprints I’ve attended recently—ML engineers, developers, NGO folks, funders, researchers, and partners, all in one space. Huge shoutout to the organizers for running a tight ship—every session was well-planned, and they even updated the schedule daily based on feedback.
A few blogs have come out covering the sprint—worth checking out:
AI for Global Development Sprint – Lessons & Insights
Cutting Through the Noise – Early AI Insights
AI for Doing Good – Lessons from the Frontlines
I met a lot of interesting people at the event. A few that stood out:
Paul from
Agency Fund
was my roommate for a night since Jamie fell sick. We had a long chat before he finally called it a night—two hours later than planned. One thing that stuck with me was his reason for choosing to live in Africa. He said
it’s a great place to introduce the world to kids
, have fun with friends, and experience the real world instead of being glued to screens. He’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually live by the values they talks about. A lot of folks say they love remote work, nature, and being away from the city, but then you find them settling right back into city life. No judgment—everyone has their reasons.
I also met Saloni from
Digital Green
. We took a long evening walk and post session talk over tea break. She’s an ML engineer who joined
Digital Green
a few months ago after finishing her PhD in Sweden. It was great to get her perspective on machine learning, especially from someone deep in research.
On the first day of the sprint, the group was split into three focus areas: education, agriculture, and health. I joined the agriculture funder panel discussion, and Arjun Venkatraman from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation really stood out. His family has been in the social sector for three generations, and his perspective was different from most. One point he made stuck with me: while we’re pouring money into AI, we’re not putting nearly enough into evaluation. There are endless tools promising to help the sector, but without proper evaluation, we’re just going on gut feeling—which isn’t always right.
I connected with Prashast Srivastava and Yana from
Saajha
. We joined a working session where they shared how they’re using
wadhwani.ai
. They explained how audio clips from students are analyzed, assessed, and then used to assign students specific levels. This way, the next activities sent to each student can be personalized to their current level. They’re also using AI to continuously track student progress as they complete more activities and advance to higher levels.
It’s always great meeting the Agency Fund folks in person. We’ve done a few sprints together, so catching up with Rob, Linus, Jake, Edmund, Temina, and others always feels comfortable.
This time, I spent some time chatting with Linus about the chatbot project they’re planning with
Rocketlearning
. Later, on our cab ride to happy hour, he shared stories from his time at Google and anecdotes of the culture there
Now I’m back home in Pauri, settling back into the slower rhythm. After weeks of travel, sprints, and back-to-back conversations, it feels good to have some quiet. The last month was packed—new people, ideas, and a lot to process. Some things will stick, some will fade, and some will probably resurface when I least expect them to. For now, it’s time to recharge, get back to work, and see where all these conversations lead.Title: Conversations and the Ubuntu Spirit: Tech4dev’s Kochi Sprint

I am Anand, one of the co-founders of The Apprentice Project (TAP). Our non-profit uses a tech-enabled WhatsApp chatbot that uses co-curricular electives like Arts, Dance, Coding, and Science as a medium to develop 21st-century skills (creativity, self-confidence, and problem-solving) for middle and high school students from underserved communities. We currently impact 21,000+ students across India.
We have been partnering with Tech4dev for the last few years and this was my first time engaging with Tech4dev Sprint, I personally was very excited to meet and interact with a diverse group of individuals.
For me the heart of the Sprint was not just technology or data; it was the conversations.
I found myself engaging in various dialogues with Rob, Vinod Rajasekaran, Ishaan, and Rohit.
Together, we explored the potential of Machine Learning models to address the issue of student churn. Our shared goal was to reduce the dropout rates among our students, which made these conversations even more rigorous and meaningful.
With Lobo, our mentor discussions on how to fundraise effectively and about his vision of the data catalyst program and LLM cohort. Working with Lobo has always been more than just knowledge-sharing; it was always about friendship and how we co-partner in solving various problems towards student learning.
With Edmund, it was all about the power of LLMs and how we can use it to solve social problems. Jacob from Bandu inspired us with his insights on leveraging business models for social impact. Conversations with Toshal unveiled the challenges of the social sector, connecting us on a human level.
These conversations were not merely intellectual exchanges; they were heartfelt discussions fueled by a collective passion for making a difference. Through these conversations & connections, I found the essence of Ubuntu . Ubuntu is not just a concept; it’s a way of being, a shared understanding that our success is bound to the upliftment of others.
To the Tech4dev team, a huge thank you for fostering an environment where conversations transcend the ordinary. Your work not only transforms sectors but also hearts, embodying the true essence of Ubuntu.Title: Counting India Enhancements

About Factly:
In 2005, India legislated one of the best ?Right to Information? laws in the world which changed the public information landscape and accessibility in the country. It was the first step towards transparency and accountability of governance. In 2012, India came up with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), popularly known as the ?Open Data policy? of the Government of India. In spite of these systems in place, data and information remain in complex and overwhelming formats in the country. Some of the data that is meant for the public does not even exist in the public domain.
Factly
was born to create supporting platforms and infrastructure to bridge this gap and strengthen democracy through engagement. Factly strives to cultivate civic participation and engaging citizens in accessing, understanding and using high-value government records at the centre, state and local body levels.
Counting India:
Counting India
(CI) is an initiative of Factly. CI makes data related to the States/Districts in India more accessible and understandable. The primary source of data for CI is the Census of India 2011. In CI, one can compare any two States/Districts side by side. One can also embed, access or download the data. We envision that every person who is interested in using data in their sphere of work will value CI?s platform. CI will also be a reliable resource for policymakers, journalists and researchers to explore and discover stories of public interest in India.
In June 2018, Project Tech4Dev came across the CI platform and was impressed with the work done and came forward to fund the expansion of the tool to include more data sets and visualizations. The 2
nd
phase of the project took off towards the end of September 2018 and over the next 6 months, we have included about 50 high-value data sets and included more visualizations.
CI provides a user-friendly interface to access census data by navigating through the India map and clicking on any state or district to get the data one wants to access. One can also compare data of any two places up to the district level.
One can also search various census data sets through Search Datasets option and can access the data of any place by searching for it.
Currently, a few front-end changes are being made to make the whole experience better. In the future, many other datasets relating to granular data will be added.

Author: Nishika Yadav
Date: January 2025
Category: Uncategorized
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/crafting-tailored-prompts-building-a-chatbot-for-public-policy-officials/
==================================================

To bridge the gap in accessibility and understanding of local policies,
Veddis
introduced Kunji, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered WhatsApp chatbot, enabled by
Glific
. By ingesting policy PDFs from Central and State Departments, it creates a comprehensive knowledge base tailored for officials. Kunji is designed to empower SRLM officials, CBO OBs, and beneficiaries by streamlining information retrieval, offering personalized insights, and providing quick access to vital policy knowledge. This solution addresses the challenges of inefficient access to policy documents, making it especially valuable for contract-based officials, and enabling informed decision-making and smoother implementation of policies at every level.
During the creation of Kunji, it became clear that simply feeding policy documents into an AI and generating responses wouldn’t suffice. Public policy is nuanced, and so are the needs of its stakeholders. The goal was clear: to develop an intelligent assistant capable of interpreting policy documents and delivering responses tailored to officials’ specific needs, whether it was the desired response length or preferred language.
The journey from policy documents to a polished, functional chatbot revolved around understanding official’s intent, refining OpenAI prompts, and continuously improving the outputs. Here’s how we made it work:
1. Understanding the User’s Context
Based on the research conducted by the Veddis team, these were the identified key needs that officials might have from a chatbot designed to assist with documentation queries. These goals include:
Personalized Answers
: Offering tailored responses based on the user’s role or position through a login system.
Concise and Specific Responses
: Providing clear summaries and accurate answers to user queries.
Conversational Interaction
: Creating a human-like conversational experience to enhance usability.
Access to Original Documents
: Ensuring links to source documents are available for deeper exploration and transparency.
Multilingual Support
: Allowing users to interact in their preferred language, making the chatbot more accessible.
We started by analyzing common questions officials might ask, such as:
“What are the functions and activities of the village organization?”
“What is the Credit Linkage Process in SHG(self help groups) ?.”
“Define Roles, Responsibilities and Portfolios of Sub-committees?”
Understanding the needs of the users (in this case, policy officials) and identifying key questions to clarify our objectives was a crucial step in defining a clear vision and setting precise goals for the chatbot.
2. Preparing Policy Documents
To ensure precise and efficient responses, policy documents in PDF format were converted into Markdown files, which were subsequently indexed in a vector database for the OpenAI assistant to query. To achieve the highest fidelity in text extraction, we explored multiple approaches, including:
Azure AI Document Intelligence
Zerox – PDF/Image to Markdown Conversion
We evaluated the prompts using Markdown outputs generated by both methods. This dual evaluation allowed us to refine the system, ensuring not only the most accurate text extraction but also that the dataset itself was factored into the assessment process for creating a robust and reliable system.
3. The Art of Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering was at the core of the kunji’s development. OpenAI’s strength lies in interpreting well-crafted prompts, and we focused on fine-tuning these to meet user needs. We tested various prompts to refine responses, carefully documenting every change to ensure that even minor adjustments were tracked and didn’t get mixed with less effective iterations. Each iteration of prompts tackled specific user needs and pain points.Let’s walk you through each prompt, allowing you to observe the differences and learn from them firsthand.
Prod-1: Precision Through Structure
Focused on
concise responses
(e.g., 1-2 WhatsApp messages).
Required answers to cite sources explicitly, ensuring trustworthiness.
Encouraged follow-up questions for incomplete or vague queries.
Response Guidelines:
You are a chatbot specializing in policy information retrieval. Your audience consists of government officials seeking precise answers based on the provided Knowledge Base. Do not use any external information or assumptions—only respond with content from the files indexed in the vector store. Structure:

Summarize what is covered in the latest amendment (from the highest-numbered file, e.g., 003_LatestAmendment.pdf).

Style:

Keep answers concise (1-2 WhatsApp messages).

Use bullet points to enhance clarity.

Bold key points and quote specific terms and acronyms exactly as they appear in the documents.

Accuracy and Limits:

If you encounter a question or acronym not covered in the Knowledge Base, politely state:

“I'm unsure. Could you please ask your question again or clarify the acronym?”

If the answer requires information outside the Knowledge Base, respond:

“I don't have information on that topic.”

Never provide speculative or incomplete information. If the query requires further clarification to match the contents of the vector store, ask a follow-up question to ensure an accurate response.

Always cite the source using the section title or document name.

Handling Document Changes:

Use the latest amendment to prioritize recent updates.

Include relevant numbers or statistics from the documents when applicable.

Important: Never provide speculative or incomplete information. If the query requires further clarification to match the contents of the vector store, ask a follow-up question to ensure an accurate response.
Challenge
: This version often felt rigid, and users wanted more role-specific customization. The response lacked structure as well.
Prod-2: Role-Awareness Introduced
Tailored responses to the roles and responsibilities of the inquiring official.
Added a

, suitable for communication with government officials.
Incorporated
error handling
, e.g., “I’m sorry, but the provided policy documents do not contain information on this topic.”
This prompt was structured properly as compared to the prompt above.
Outcome
: This improved relevance but lacked flexibility in handling nuanced queries. It also lacked any instructions to attach the source URL of the document used to answer the question.
Exp-1: Enhanced Usability
Emphasized concise, actionable answers.
Avoided escape characters or technical jargon that could confuse officials.
Proactively suggested follow-up questions to demonstrate assistance.
You are an AI assistant designed to assist officials of various designations by answering their questions based on the provided policy documents. Always keep the answer under 150 words, do not cross it at all but do not miss to include any keep point in the answer either. Your responses should adhere to the Instructions given below:

*Instructions :* 

**1.Source Utilization:**

- Reference only the information available within the provided vector store of policy documents. Avoid including external data or internet sources.

- When dealing with file names with incremental numbers, prioritize the latest version first (indicated by the highest number), as it represents updates or addendums. If additional context is required, refer to related documents in descending order of numbering.

**2.Role-Specific Responses:**

Customize your answers to align with the specific roles and responsibilities of the inquiring official, ensuring the information is relevant and actionable.

**3.Clarity and Precision:**

Deliver clear, concise, and accurate responses, addressing the query directly.

Avoid using escape characters (e.g., \[ \text) in formulas or technical details, as they may confuse readers.

**4.Handling Gaps in Information:**

If the provided policy documents lack information relevant to a query, respond with:

"I'm sorry, but the provided policy documents do not contain information on this topic."

Encourage follow-up questions or additional context to better assist in retrieving relevant information.

**5.Professional Tone:**

-Maintain a professional, respectful tone suitable for communication with officials at all times.

**6.Confidentiality:**

-Safeguard the confidentiality of policy documents and the information they contain. Ensure all responses adhere to this principle.

**7.Citing Sources:**

-Use the SourceURL field from the documents to include Google Drive links to the relevant PDFs directly in the response.

-Embed these links contextually in the body of the answer, ensuring a natural flow without redundant references. Do not repeat or list the sources again at the end if they are already mentioned within the body of the text.

**8.Avoid Unnecessary Links:**

Do not generate placeholder or generic links like “For more detailed information, you can refer to the document here” where “here” is an artificial link. Only use actual, provided links from the policy documents.

*Summary* 

- After answering, provide a brief summary of your response to enhance understanding.

- By adhering to these instructions, ensure your answers are precise, role-specific, and well-sourced, with a seamless integration of relevant document links where applicable.

- Provide direct and concise responses without unnecessary introductory phrases. For example, when explaining a concept or listing criteria, eliminate verbose descriptions and start with a simple, clear statement followed by the main content. Do not state the words of question again for the introductory line

- Do not cross the word limit of maximum 150 without missing any key content of the answer. Keep the answer in points only.
Feedback
: This struck a balance between precision and brevity, reducing user frustration. What lacked was the length of the answer which seemed too long to the client and they felt like it had too many adjectives which would take away the spotlight from the answer.
Observation:
As the prompt grew longer, it became increasingly challenging for the LLM to adhere to all the specified rules. To address this, we introduced two OpenAI assistants into the glific chat flow: the first assistant handles the file search, while the second summarizes the response from the first using a dedicated summary prompt.
Prod-4 and Prod4-Summary: Contextual Language Handling and Summarization
This prompt retained its original structure, with the summary component extracted into a separate dedicated prompt. Additionally, a new section was incorporated to handle Hindi queries, ensuring better language-specific processing.
Prod-4:

Always keep the answer under 150 words, do not cross it at all but do not miss to include any keep point in the answer either. Your responses should adhere to the Instructions given below: 

*Instructions :* 

....Continued same as the prompt above except summary paragraph was removed and directions for answering hindi query was added.
**Hindi**

If the question asked is in Hindi, keep the language and tone formal. Use the exact terms or translations of the words used in the PDF. Do NOT transliterate or make the language casual.
Additionally, we implemented a secondary summarization assistant with a concise, dedicated prompt. This ensured the main prompt remained manageable and avoided overloading the model with excessive rules, maintaining its ability to consistently generate accurate and structured responses.
Prod4-Summary:
- After answering, provide a brief summary of your response to enhance understanding.

- By adhering to these instructions, ensure your answers are precise, role-specific, and well-sourced, with a seamless integration of relevant document links where applicable.

- Provide direct and concise responses without unnecessary introductory phrases. For example, when explaining a concept or listing criteria, eliminate verbose descriptions and start with a simple, clear statement followed by the main content.

*Hindi*

If the question asked is in Hindi, keep the language and tone formal. Use the exact terms or translations of the words used in the PDF. Do NOT transliterate or make the language casual.
Solution :
To improve summarization, we maintained brevity by setting a strict word limit (under 150 words) and instructed the bot to present responses in point form to ensure clarity while preserving key details.
Result
: Officials appreciated the adaptability and professional tone in both languages.
Prod-5 :
Once the summary component was refined, we were close to achieving the desired answer structure. The final elements to address were enhancing the quality of Hindi responses for Hindi queries and ensuring the referenced document links were accurately included in the output.
We perfected the formal Hindi responses for Hindi-script queries using a translation workflow:
The bot translates the Hindi question into English.
The translated English query is sent to the vector store, which currently contains all documents in English.
The retrieved English answer is then translated back into Hindi, ensuring the final response is accurate, contextually appropriate and user language specific.
You are an AI assistant designed to assist officials of various designations by answering their questions based on the provided policy documents. Your responses should adhere to the Instructions given below:

*Instructions :* 

**Hindi**

If a user asks the question in Hindi, follow these steps:

***Handling Hindi Questions and Answers:***

1. Translate the Hindi question into English in as close a meaning as possible. Translate key terms (verbs, nouns) directly. Do not transliterate words. 

2. Send this translated English question to the vector store.3. Retrieve the answer in English. Then, translate it back into Hindi with formal words used in the documents, to as close a meaning as possible, retaining the formatting and structure of the English response. Ensure you use the exact terms or translations as they appear in the PDF documents. Do not transliterate or make the language casual. Use formal tone and language in responses. 

4. Keep the answers in points only. those points should be very direct and actionable.

5. Keep answers very direct and concise, do not add context on your own , only include what is their in the vector store. 

**1.Source Utilization:**

......Rest same as the prompt above
Prod-6:
This is the current prompt in production which is a streamlined version of the previous iterations, designed to cover all essential aspects in a concise and straightforward manner. It is used in conjunction with the summary prompt outlined earlier to ensure the desired product.
**You are an AI assistant designed to help officials by answering their questions based on provided policy documents.**
**Instructions:**

### Language Handling

1. **If the question is in English:**

   - Respond in English.

2. **If the question uses Hindi words in English script:**

   - respond in Hindi script

3. **If the question is in Hindi script:**

   1. Translate the Hindi question into English, without transliteration, capturing the closest meaning.

   2. Send this translated English question to the vector store.

   3. Retrieve the answer in English from the vector store.

   4. Translate the English answer back into Hindi script, using formal, policy-approved language and terminology as in the PDF documents. Do not introduce informal language or transliterations.

   5. Present the final Hindi response as comprehensive bullet points.

### Response Formatting

1. Keep all answers brief and to the point.

2. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.

3. Include only information from the vector store (policy documents). Do not add any external context.

4. Maintain a professional and respectful tone at all times.

### Source Utilization

1. Use only information from the provided policy documents (vector store). Do not reference external or internet sources.

2. If multiple versions of a document exist, prioritize the latest (highest-numbered) version. If not found there, move to previous versions in descending order.

3. If multiple related documents are available (e.g., with the same acronym), apply the same version priority rules.

4. Call out the Google Drive path to the file used to answer the question. If the document(s) used to find the answer to the question include a SourceURL, include that sourceURL and file name at the end of your answer as a para without FAIL. If no SourceURL is available for the referenced information, search the file called 'listoffilesandpaths'. try to match the file name under column 'PDF name' to the markdown file name and return the google drive link to the source PDF file the answer is pulled from. If the match is not found, do not provide a link. Do this for all answers in all languages.

### Handling Missing Information

- If the policy documents do not contain the requested information, respond with:

    *"I'm sorry, but the provided policy documents do not contain information on this topic."*

- Encourage the user to follow up with additional questions or context if needed.
The final and critical issue with the bot was the inconsistency in the accuracy of the source links being returned. This was resolved
by uploading an Excel file named “listoffilesandpath”
into the vector store. This file contained three key columns: the names of markdown files in the vector store (representing policy documents), the corresponding names of the original PDF files, and their respective Google Drive links. The prompt was updated to reference this file explicitly, ensuring the bot could accurately map markdown files to their associated PDFs and retrieve the correct Google Drive link.
4. Additional Prompt Management Steps
To streamline prompt optimization,
multiple instances of Google Assistant were deployed
, allowing for precise comparisons of outputs based on minute prompt adjustments. Each identified issue—such as contextual understanding, language handling, or link inconsistency—was
thoroughly analyzed to isolate the root cause
, ensuring that only the relevant section of the prompt was refined.
In addition to creating multiple Google Assistants,
several Glific chat flows were developed
to facilitate direct product testing and enable side-by-side comparisons with the primary product chat flow, simplifying the evaluation process.
Feedback
from the Kunji team, particularly Rajshree, Ujjwal, and Vaishali,
was instrumental in refining the chatbot. Their detailed insights helped identify discrepancies between bot-generated and golden answers, enabling targeted enhancements and ensuring the bot delivered precise responses.
5. Metrics of Success
We achieved
a satisfaction rate of 70-80%
with the bot, marking significant progress in meeting user expectations. The testing phase included evaluation by both the Kunji team and government officials, who represent our primary target audience. Their feedback was instrumental in identifying areas of improvement and validating the bot’s performance in real-world scenarios.
To further improve the success rate and ensure the bot achieves the highest standards, we will continue refining its capabilities. The specific enhancements planned for the next version of the Kunji bot will be detailed later in the blog.
6. Lessons Learned
Documentation is Crucial
: Having a structured system, especially for comparison and evaluation, was invaluable.
Prompt Versioning Matters
: Iterative prompt development ensured steady improvement and consistency.
Empathy Drives Design
: Understanding user workflows and needs was key to creating effective prompts.
Longer Prompts Don’t Guarantee Better Responses
: Overly long prompts risk context overload, leading to inaccuracies. Concise, well-structured prompts are more effective and reduce the likelihood of confusion or hallucinations.
In the end
Building this chatbot was about more than leveraging OpenAI’s capabilities—it was about bridging the gap between raw policy documents and user-friendly, actionable insights just by prompt engineering. By focusing on user needs and refining prompts iteratively, we transformed a good assistant into an indispensable tool for public policy officials. This blog aims to provide technical insights and practical strategies to enhance your own prompt engineering workflows and achieve greater precision in AI-driven solutions.Title: DATA CATALYST PROGRAM: Technology as a catalyst to bring about a change in the social sector

==================================================

By Sudha Upadhyayula, Chief Operating Officer, One Billion Literates Foundation
Having journeyed through various enriching experiences in the social sector, I was fortunate enough to be a part of Dasra’s Accelerator and subsequently, their Leadership program. Both of these experiences were a testament to Dasra’s exceptional ability to curate insightful and transformative events.
So, when whispers of the Data Catalyst Program reached my ears, a collaborative effort co-organized by Dasra, I was excited.
At OBLF, we are currently navigating through a crucial phase. We’re on the brink of integrating technology solutions that promise to amplify the scale and impact of our programs significantly. Thus, the timing of this program could not have been more perfect.
The Data Catalyst Program surpassed my expectations and offered insights, tools, and perspectives that were enlightening. One of the standout features of the program was its flow and sequence. Each session built upon the last, creating a narrative that was easy to follow and yet deeply informative.
Tech4Dev’s involvement added immense value. Their interactive sessions with our team were instrumental in helping us grasp the enormity of our mission and simultaneously, enabling us to chisel down our tasks to more manageable, actionable items. It’s one thing to be made aware of the challenges ahead, but another altogether to be provided with the tools and direction to face them head-on. Tech4Dev bridged this gap flawlessly.
I also found Goalkeep’s sessions to be extremely pragmatic. In a world drowning in data, their emphasis on asking the right questions and ensuring precision in measurement was a much-needed reminder. Their focus on developing skills and habits based on evidence was a key takeaway for me.
However, the cherry on top was The Agency Fund’s sessions. The live showcase of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a potent tool in the social sector was nothing short of revelatory. In an era where AI often seems like a distant, inaccessible concept for many nonprofits, this demonstration brought it within reach, illustrating its tangible benefits and transformative potential.
In conclusion, Dasra’s Data Catalyst Program wasn’t just an event; it was an experience, one that has equipped me with direction and inspiration. As we move forward, the insights from this program will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping our technological endeavors, and for that, I am immensely grateful. If you’re in the social sector and seeking to integrate technology to enhance your impact, keep an eye out for such programs and collaborations. They’re more than worth your time.Title: DCP Cohort 1 Round 2, in Goa

==================================================

The Data Catalyst Program was an experiment by Dasra, Goalkeep, the Agency Fund and Project Tech4Dev. We started by meeting with a group of 12 NGOs in Kochi
last October
, where we introduced them to good data practices, discussed their common challenges, and left each of them with a 3-month long project on which to report progress in January.
And I’ll admit that back in October I was not skeptical per se, but maybe a little confused about what would be achieved over the quarter. But boy were those emotions misplaced. Every single NGO showed up more knowledgeable, more confident, and with demonstrated progress by this second and final meeting.
This second round was also much better organized than the first. For one, the organizers solicited and acted upon feedback from Kochi to deliver a single rather than two parallel tracks. Second, the post-session feedback was tightened up which gave us a better view of what worked and what didn’t.
I wasn’t an organizer – that mantle from the PT4D side was worn entirely by Abhishek Nair. But I was a co-presenter in two of the sessions along with Ashwini Lotlikar, one on data governance and the other on data analysis using LLMs. Both were a challenge to plan but for very different reasons.
Data governance is dry and boring. Even worse, the subject is vast and tying it together is less of an Oh wow! and more of an Oh great. So Ashwini and I had to choose what to cover and how to construct a narrative through these pieces. We ended up with the theme of data sharing and put together a presentation going from internal sharing to external sharing, focussing on the who, the why and the for-how-long (and in particular we sidestepped the how).
Next we interspersed our presentation with several group discussions. I thought we had too many of these but participant feedback ended up validating our decision. The audience was given hypothetical situations and asked to talk through them donning different hats in their orgs – the founder’s hat, a funder’s hat, the hat of a program director and the hat of an engineer. Discussions were lively and everyone participated.
The second session was on how NGOs might use LLMs like ChatGPT. Edmund from the Agency Fund had conducted a ChatGPT Plus demo back in Kochi and we thought we’d lead the participants through a hands-on session this time.
We didn’t want to buy a bunch of monthly ChatGPT Plus subscriptions for a 1 hour session; instead we decided to use a tool called
Julius AI
. Julius AI is built on top of OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s APIs and has been designed purely for data analysis. It lets you upload a CSV and ask questions about it, generate charts and see the Python code underneath. And best of all – 15 messages free! they said.
Well they
said
that, but halfway through our session our participants found that Julius’s system was smart enough to notice that all these logins were coming from the same place, and decided to shut us down. In hindsight I should have spoken with the Julius team first, telling them what we were planning to do and would they please-not-rate-limit us for that one morning. But I didn’t, and so they did.
However – until we were rate-limited, our participants did extremely well! We had provided them with two datasets, one on Covid mortality and recovery rates around the world, and another on the health factors which might predict the onset of diabetes. Every single group was able to do a preliminary analysis of at least one dataset and contribute to the group discussion after.
If we were to do this again, I would definitely want to
Do more advance preparation, including getting the presentation vetted a week ahead of time
Prepare for third-party tools not working as expected, including by reaching out to them if we’re using a free tier
Summarize the group discussions on a screen as they unfold
It was a pleasure to have had the opportunity to interact with so many NGOs through this program and I hope we do it again.Title: DCP Cohort 2 Day 1

==================================================

We just completed the second cohort of the Data Catalyst Program, a joint initiative with
Dasra
and
Goalkeep
. The program consists of two in-person workshops three months apart, during which each participating organization works towards specific goals. Ten organizations participated in this year’s cohort, each having a mentor assigned from Goalkeep or from Project Tech4Dev, with the mentors meeting their org at least twice a month between the two workshops.
Our first workshop was held in Mumbai in
September
, with sessions by Goalkeep, Dasra and Tech4Dev. The second one was held in Bangalore and I’m going to describe the first half of the first day to provide an idea of what we do.
After a welcome with reintroductions by everyone in the room, Abhishek went over the schedule for the two days: 9pm – 5pm with breaks for tea and lunch, mostly sessions by a presenter but also some work time between participants and their mentors. There was much excitement because we were handing out a FAT GRANT and everyone was tweaking their pitch decks for day 2.
The three Ls
Kavneet from Dasra began with a “reflection” exercise, where she went around the room and asked everybody to share their “three Ls”: what they
L
iked about the program, what they
L
earnt from it, and what they are now
L
onging to put into practice.
Prasad,
Fortify Health
: “I liked the continuous engagement between the two workshops”
Rukhmini,
Saturday Art Class
: “This gave us an opportunity to reflect on our program and the work that we’re doing”
Daneshwar,
Digital Green
: “I learnt about new AI tools, visualization and storytelling”
Prasanna,
Caring with Colour
: “We deconstructed and then reconstructed our entire approach”
Data Leadership
Next she moved into the Data Leadership session. She started by asking the audience which of them identified as Data Leaders. People hesitated, unsure how to answer. “What is a Data Leader?” some asked. Whatever you think it is, Kavneet answered. Eventually we had three groups, a group who answered Yes, a group who answered No, and then the Undecided.
The Data Leaders were asked why they identified that way, and what their definition was which made them answer Yes. They said that Data Leaders
– Define a vision for data use in their organization
– Foster a culture of data-driven exploration among their peers
– Inspire others to experiment and fail
– Empower people outside the data team to take decisions based on data
The No group agreed that these are what Data Leaders should do, but they did not identify that way because
– The strategy teams and decision makers in their organization don’t use data
– Their roles don’t allow for leadership
BUT they all wanted to be data leaders, and wanted to grow in that direction. Kavneet then responded with a powerful line, which is that “It is a myth that leaders only exist at the top of their organizations”. I noticed a few eyes lighting up and heads nodding at this statement.
[Aside: At the end of this exercise the Undecided group declared that they were Data Leaders :D]
The Five Pillars
Strategy
Prasad,
Fortify Health
: “Our strategy was to drive our vision
within our constraints
, identifying gaps as well as opportunities”
Change
Management
Akshata,
Antarang
: “One change we drove was moving from handling our data across Google Sheets and Salesforce to adopting
Dalgo
as our data platform”
Decisions
Vineet,
Dream a Dream
: “A major decision we took was moving from Google Sheets and Access to AirTable”
Collaboration
Shaheeda,
Antarang
: “The data and program teams now have fortnightly meetings to collaborate on dashboarding”
Leadership
Pravin,
Farmers for Forests
: “We empowered other teams to adopt new tools”
The session closed with participants listing their own examples on Post-It notes and sticking them on large sheets of chart paper, one for each Pillar. We did a similar exercise during the first workshop where we stuck the chart paper on the walls around the room for maximum visibility… but this hotel wouldn’t let us do that. This took away from the impact (just a bit) but we did notice that the pillars with the most examples were Collaboration and Change Management.
Dashboards with Optimized Tables
The second session of the morning was by Jishnu from Goalkeep. Starting with the premise that two widespread problems with visualization dashboards are slow loading times and high running costs, he posited that these could effectively be addressed through better (smarter!) table design. He first defined the three layers of a data transformation pipeline:
Staging (raw data, maybe with some columns dropped or fixed data types but not other changes)
Intermediate (where all the work happens)
Fact (the tables which are exposed to the visualization tools)
The rest of his session was on how to design the “right” Fact tables. Design starts with the final dashboard from which you work backwards to arrive at the underlying fact table. He told us that we need to identify our metrics, our dimensions, and our column-combinations which yield unique identifiers for every row.
Since this is somewhat complicated, he had designed a highly-interactive and color-coded set of Google Sheets for us to use. The Goalkeep team are masters at this, and participants were able to easily follow the steps of the process and watch the cells in their spreadsheets populate automatically. There were two level 1 problems and one level 2 which kept the room busy until the end of the session.
It was a great start to an excellent two days, filled with learning, collaboration, sharing and a lot of joy.Title: DCP Module 1, Mentors POV

==================================================

By Tejas Mahajan
This blog captures my (Tejas Mahajan) reflections, and personal unhinged opinions about the subject matter of the workshops conducted and other conversations. As a practitioner in radical candor, I welcome your criticism of this reflection as well. Personally, the best part of the 2.5 day event was to engage in deep conversations with the CMHLP team (the mentees) and go through the mentoring process. To challenge their thinking, have my thinking challenged, and to understand the deep nuances of their work aimed at reducing the gap in mental health support.
DAY 1: NGO Mela and the 1-1 mentoring session
The festivities started off with a
NGO mela
, where all the participants got a chance to explore the work being done by the cohort peers. This set the stage for participants to open up with each other, and realise that they were not alone from their respective sectors.
Representatives from 13 wonderful orgs were present:
Learning Links foundation
Masoom
SEEDS
Make A Difference
Nayi Disha
Maitrayana
WASH Institute
Muktaa Charitable Foundation
WELL Labs
Sristi Foundation
Centre for Aquatic Livelihood Jaljeevika
Centre for Mental Health, Law and Policy
Urja Trust
This was followed by a 2 hour block conversation between NGOs and mentors to conclude on the problem statement, and the scope of work to be undertaken over the next 3 months. Problem statement template had to answer 3 key questions:
What is the current situation
What is it leading to
What work will be undertaken
This needed a lot of back and forth, pushing the thinking, sometimes asking basic silly questions, and having to repeat sentences back to confirm we are on the same page. This was followed by a quick session on ideating the scope of work.
I personally think the first 2 hours provided a decent enough roadmap, but is likely to undergo changes as the weeks turn into months, and the finer details of the problems emerge through the implementation efforts. Nonetheless, the day concluded with mentors submitting the responses for problem statements and scope of work in the “Data Dialogues” doc, in preparation for the session planned on day 2.
Day 2: Common grounds, Confusions galore and Canvas for dashboards
Data Dialogues
was the first session facilitated on day 2. One of the key outcomes of this session was NGOs realising that the majority of the cohort was in the same boat as them. Dealing with “fragmented data” coming from “various sources” trying to “consolidate” and  improve the “efficiency in analyzing”, “driving up the usage of existing systems”, and problems of such nature.
The orgs were able to find “same as me” peers, and peers whose problem statements they could potentially help out in. This brought the cohort to a sense of commonality.
Then came the confusion, the murky topic of outputs, and outcomes. Theory of change, related metrics and indicators, through the session
Metrics that matter.
The valiant effort to try and bring clarity was facilitated by
Sharon Weir
from 4th Wheel Social Impact. Go
here
to see the session deck yourself, and see if your thoughts on the topic align.
Here is my opinion on articulating outputs and outcomes. At the core, folks work in social impact to make a positive difference towards worthy causes. This involves working with people in real life, dealing with the messy systems, getting stuff done, having an effect on people that can possibly never be measured in a number. But what makes their work sound “cool” is when they are able to talk about “development outcomes”, “change in indicators”. When they can articulate a “theory of change” which defines the method to their madness for relentlessly pursuing their everyday tasks with excellence.
This requires plotting and scheming. Intellectualizing, sometimes overly so. But this is crucial because this clever articulation is what attracts the money, partnerships, and new talent, folks inclined to pursue a higher calling and devote their good years to join and continue the mission.
So this is the bitter pill that must be swallowed by not just you as a leader. But also by your team members to sound “cool” while continuing to go about their business as usual that “changes the world” one task at a time.
Third session of the day on the
Art and Science of Data Visualization
, condensing a wealth of knowledge on how to approach creation of dashboards into a single
deck
. A framework to draft the requirements. Starting with “key questions” and “decisions” that need to be made, to then arriving at the “indicators” and continuously asking why is this decision needed, while keeping the larger objective (outcome that needs to be achieved) of the org, at the front, mid and center.
The session also shared practical tips on Visual Hierarchy principles implemented on a dashboard shared were. Go
here
to see all the practical tips in detail on dashboard design. I highly recommend it.

Screenshot from the 1.2,4 rule
This was followed by another half a day of mentoring. This is where NGO and mentors could start making progress towards the scope of work.
Personally, this was an extremely important time for CMHLP and myself to go deep into their program flow, the data being collected at each step, the tools used, and the impending need for data points at each level in their programs. We put 2 of their programs (
Atmiyata
and
Outlive
) under the microscope, and tried to arrive at what are the most important aspects that we should focus on solutioning through the next 3 months.
Screenshot of the program steps and data points mapping
DAY 3: Data leadership, panel talk and the mandatory AI session
The final day began with a session on
Data Leadership
. The crux of the session is still unclear to me, but the facilitator did play a long time favorite Ted Talk of mine, on Everyday Leadership and If nothing else, that idea is worth sharing 😉 watch
here
in case you have not. This was followed by a conversation panel featuring leaders from Arman, Civis and Pratham. As all panel discussions go, this was high level, with just enough hot takes to be a little edgy, make people laugh but resonate that idea that data is important, it is a continuous journey. The hottest take being “don’t bring me any dashboards” at the Data Catalyst Program. The irony was not lost on anyone.
This was followed by a session on AI. This did spark conversations from the participants about what are the risks in using AI for analysis.
Then came the last of the mentoring sessions. We used this time to dive deeper into the Outlive program. We started asking the “key questions” needed for the “decisions to be made” to achieve the 2 most important outcomes for the program. The outcomes being “Access to youth in need” for suicide prevention helpline. And the “Quality support” provided. The key questions we came up with are shared below. This involved deep conversation with the CMHLP team. Challenging the need for each of the questions that were being put up before we recorded them and discarding questions that did not lead to the outcomes.
We ended the mentoring session with deciding the action points and potential outputs to achieve by the end of August month.
For the Atmiyata Program

==================================================

We recently hosted our second DCP cohort in Mumbai, and this time, we made sure to spend quality time with the NGOs, focusing on meaningful interactions. But before diving into that, I want to share how this DCP cohort has significantly improved, particularly with the introduction of 1:1 mentorship.
In the previous DCP, I wasn’t as involved in the process. With a larger team, it felt like the responsibility was spread too thin, both on our side and the NGOs’. I also felt that I missed out on the chance to review the problem statements from different NGOs and choose the ones where I could make the most impact.
This time, with the 1:1 mentorship, the experience felt more personal and effective, allowing for deeper engagement and a stronger sense of responsibility.
In the DCP Cohort 2, I particularly appreciated the 1:1 mentorship for several reason
In-Depth Understanding:
It provides an opportunity to dive deeply into the data systems of the specific NGO you’re assigned to, allowing for a more focused and thorough analysis.
Collaborative Learning and Sharing:
The mentorship has fostered a culture of learning and sharing. NGOs are openly discussing their problem statements and potential solutions, leading to a richer exchange of ideas. This collaborative environment has significantly enhanced the mentorship experience.
Enhanced Mentor Collaboration:
The emphasis on sharing has also strengthened collaboration among mentors, enabling them to work together more effectively in addressing challenges across different NGOs.
Working with AVANTI FELLOWS
I was assigned to
Avanti Fellows
and also I asked Abhishek to give me something complex which I can work on. But before diving into the data system of theirs here’s a short description on what they do.
Avanti Fellows
is a nonprofit organization focused on providing affordable and high-quality education to students from low-income backgrounds in India. They work primarily in the field of STEM education, offering programs that help students prepare for competitive exams like the JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test). Avanti Fellows employs a peer-learning model and technology-driven teaching methods to enhance learning outcomes, aiming to bridge the education gap for underprivileged students and empower them to pursue higher education and careers in science and engineering fields.
As part of the DCP program, we conducted our first meeting with
Avanti Fellows
around the last week of July. Before this, the organization needed to complete the DMA score, which helped them decide their focus areas for the next two months. We had over a month to finalize the SOW, and I was fortunate to work with Avanti, as they already had a clear vision of what they wanted to improve. They shared the problem statement with me which I’m sharing here
Problem Statement:
Their current data infrastructure for tracking metrics across various tech modules is disorganized. For example, chapter tagging is handled in Google Sheets, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies. To access metrics, we often pull data from multiple sources like Google Sheets and PostgreSQL, and write scheduled queries on top of that. Each program has its own set of metrics, resulting in the creation of multiple tables on BigQuery. Moreover, our scheduled queries on BigQuery lack version control, making it difficult to maintain data integrity and track changes over time. PMs and operations team members also spend significant time manually cleaning Google Sheets before ingesting them into BigQuery, which is time-consuming.
Review Process
Upon reviewing the disorganized state of Avanti Fellows’ data infrastructure, I suggested that they create a mapping of their data system flow. This would help them gain a clearer understanding of their existing pipelines, data dependencies, and integration points, which is essential for laying the groundwork for effective solutions. Once we had this mapping, it became immediately apparent what needed to be fixed. We then planned one immediate, achievable goal and a long-term goal focused on architectural improvements, which they could either start fixing internally or at least begin thinking about. I was very impressed with Heena and Deepansh for their dedication in putting this together and really appreciated their effort.
Immediate Goal Achieved
During my meeting with Deepansh and Heena, we briefly discussed actionable steps and identified a short pipeline that we could automate. We identified several issues with their current pipeline:
Long Queries on Looker Studio:
A lot of lengthy queries were running directly on Looker Studio, causing slow chart loading times.
Disjointed Query Scheduling:
Multiple queries were scheduled at different times, leading to the creation of separate orchestrations for each new metric.
Lack of Documentation and Version Control:
There was no documentation or version control in place for these queries, making scaling and maintenance difficult.
To address these issues, we determined that running these queries directly on Looker Studio was not ideal. Instead, we should think about pre-processing the data so that only aggregated tables are used in Looker Studio. We also suggested testing these queries directly in BigQuery or Postgres clients to check performance.
To solve the issues related to query management and orchestration, I recommended using DBT (Data Build Tool). I’m a fan of how DBT allows breaking down long queries into multiple tables, which can be organized into intermediate and aggregated schemas. The modular nature of DBT makes it easy to reuse components in intermediate steps to build additional metrics. Moreover, DBT supports GitHub integration and documentation, which resolved several issues at once.
How should we think about scaling this
Once they understood this approach, we quickly began working on it, and we successfully built the entire pipeline in Dalgo. Deepansh even set up DBT in his local environment and quickly built the first model, which was very encouraging. This experience helped them grasp several key points:
Improved Query Performance:
By breaking down queries into multiple tables with DBT, they no longer need to run long queries directly in Looker Studio, resulting in improved performance.
Automated Pipeline Scheduling:
These models can be integrated into the Dalgo pipeline, scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), and allow for easy addition of new metrics to Looker Studio.
Comprehensive Documentation:
As they build these models, they can also document each model and its functionality, which enhances maintainability.
We realized we need to review some of the queries deeply so that they can implement that in dbt by breaking down the queries and we’ve scheduled a call on
3rd September
to discuss this.
Discussion with Fortify Health
I had an insightful discussion with the team from Fortify Health about their architecture and how they manage some tools, which, while available in open source versions, they are utilizing through paid services. Here are a few key takeaways from our conversation:
Pipeline Setup:
They’ve built their data pipeline using Airbyte Cloud and DBT Cloud. I was pleased to see that someone had developed a SurveyCTO connector for them using Airbyte’s No Code method. Interestingly, it functions similarly to what we’ve already implemented in the open-source version.
Scaling Considerations:
As they scale, they need to be aware of how to manage DBT models running on DBT Cloud, especially since the free tier only supports up to 10k model runs. Beyond that, the cost increases to $100 per month.
Another concern I have is that while we built the SurveyCTO connector to benefit other NGOs, which is why we contributed it back to Airbyte, I don’t think many NGOs are aware of the open-source connectors available in the market that could help them solve their data ingestion challenges. To address this, I’m sharing my
blog
again, which I believe could be very useful for NGOs looking to leverage these resources.
Meeting with Shuzaaj, ATECF Team and Search Founder
Oh these sprints are tiring and exhausting at the same time full of learnings. After the sprint was over we met with the
Shuzaaj Team
to implement the 10 hour Dalgo POC.
Shujaaz is a nonprofit organization based in Kenya that focuses on engaging and empowering young people through innovative media and social communication platforms. The organization primarily targets youth aged 15-24, addressing critical issues such as health, economic opportunities, and social justice. Shujaaz uses a mix of comic books, radio shows, social media, and SMS messaging to reach its audience, providing them with valuable information, inspiration, and practical tools to improve their lives.
Read more about it here what we wanted to achieve and
high level goals.
We successfully developed two dashboards focused on tracking engagement with Facebook and YouTube. Vinod, who leads the FCxO team, is now spearheading discussions on how to streamline and integrate the various tools that the team uses internally, ensuring a more cohesive and efficient workflow.
After a long and exhausting week, Lobo decided to make it even more challenging by inviting me, Abhishek, and Dawit for a walk. But as usual Abhishek ditched us. We still ended up doing a 10 km walk on Sunday, from Marine Drive to Malabar Hills and not stopping there, I extended my walk in the evening with Abhishek, venturing near Carter Road and Pali Hill to achieve my first 25,000 steps in a single day.
Meeting ATECF Team on Monday
We’ve been working closely with ATECF for the past few months, and I decided it was time to meet the team in person. Hiral was incredibly helpful, introducing me to the various teams at ATECF. My main goal for the visit was to discuss and plan the next steps for Dalgo.
We had a brief discussion about the different charts they can use to represent data. They’ve provided some suggestions that will require us to modify or customize a few aspects of the implementation.
I also met Sandeep, who has recently joined the AVNI team. His role will involve aligning Dalgo with Jasper Data. I’ll be meeting with him soon to discuss how he can analyze Dalgo data for comparison.
Once we finalize the current dashboard, we’ll replicate the same view across all other dashboards in Dalgo.
Unexpectedly, we all had lunch together afterward, and I was fortunate enough to meet Amit Chandra himself. Joining us for lunch were Amit Chandra, Gayatri Lobo, Amrtha, Hiral, and Kanika.
Meeting with SEARCH founder: Anand Bang
In the same evening, Lobo invited me to meet Anand Bang. Lobo had spent close to 2 weeks to understand how the organization is being run, the processes, the initiatives, and the work is done. Do read more about it
here
. After reading this I would really want to do one week volunteer work with them and spend some there to understand how things are happening on the ground.
Okay. That’s it for now. My social energy was drained up towards the end and I need to recoverTitle: DCP – Data Catalyst Program – Mumbai Meetup

Leveling Up Our Data Game: Avanti Fellows at the Data Catalyst Program
Hey there everyone! Deepansh from Avanti Fellows here. I’ve recently returned from an incredible experience at the Data Catalyst Program (DCP) in Mumbai. I’m excited to share our journey and how it’s shaping our approach to data at Avanti.
What’s the Data Catalyst Program?
Imagine a program designed to turn NGOs into data powerhouses – that’s the Data Catalyst Program in a nutshell. But let me break it down for you: The DCP is a collaborative initiative by Tech4Dev and Dasra, aimed at helping NGOs like us harness the power of data for greater impact. It’s a six-month journey that includes about 50 hours of engagement, with two in-person modules.
The aim is to help us build strong data strategies, equip us with data-based tools and techniques, and develop a data-driven culture.
What’s cool about DCP is that it’s not just about theory. It’s hands-on, practical, and tailored to the unique needs of each org. We’re learning how to collect, analyze, and visualize data in ways that help us make better decisions. Plus the peer learning and mentorship is a big bonus!
The Mumbai Meetup
For 2.5 days, we found ourselves in a room full of passionate people from 10 different orgs. The energy was quite contagious! The cohort included people working in Climate Change, Education, Health, and Youth Empowerment, among other sectors.
Here’s a quick rundown of what went down and some of my personal thoughts:
Fun ice breakers:
We kicked off with a super fun Bingo-style ice breaker. In between sessions and talks there were other fun ice breakers that helped us get to know each other better.
Reflect on our top 3 challenges
:This exercise was really helpful in connecting us with other organizations, as many are dealing with similar challenges. It provided a platform for us to share our experiences, understand the common hurdles that nonprofits encounter in terms of data management, and explore ways to overcome them together. By learning from one another, we can identify and adopt best practices that have worked in similar contexts.
Data Visualization Session
: We delved into the art and science of creating dashboards that not only look good but also drive action, and we gained valuable insights into the importance of visual hierarchy principles for building effective dashboards. This session challenged us to re-think how we’re designing and implementing our internal dashboards. It was good to know that we’re on the right track for our external dashboards. Lesson learned: We recognised the need of defining key metrics before building dashboards. It’s essential to ensure we’re collecting the right data to answer the questions we aim to address. Additionally, this exercise highlighted the significance of maintaining a clear sequence, from the area of inquiry (e.g., Are students attending live classes?) to key questions (e.g., What is the average monthly attendance?) to actionable steps (e.g., Focus on batches with declining attendance) and prioritization. It made us rethink how to meet the needs of all stakeholders, incorporate the learnings and formulate a solid data strategy.
Automated Data Pipelines Session
: I can imagine how helpful this session would’ve been for some orgs. The concept of data pipelines, ETL flows and automation was broken down into simple terms for non-techies. If I had this session a few years ago, I would’ve saved myself a lot of headache understanding the concepts!
AI for Insights Session
: This was the most interactive AI session/talk I’ve ever seen. We got hands-on with an AI tool where we fed in both our quantitative and qualitative data. We just asked questions in plain text and out came all sorts of charts, graphs and insights. Everyone had some doubt whether they can trust these insights or not, as of now. But it was a great experience to see how AI can be used to generate insights from data, especially for teams that don’t have data scientists or analysts.
Building a Data-Led Organization Panel Talk
: A panel of experts shared their wisdom on managing digital transformation and fostering a data-driven culture. This was my favorite session! It was great to hear everyone’s story and challenges. It was also a big reminder that things take time and data-led thinking needs to be nurtured on an org-wide level. Deval, co-founder of Dasra, who was hosting the panel, introduced the panelists by some nicknames he had given them. I seem to have forgotten their names but the nicknames and the stories behind them are still quite fresh.
Key takeaways from the panel discussion: • Establish a common organizational vocabulary • Recognise that impactful change comes from those interacting directly with beneficiaries, not just technology • Program should be centrally designed and executed top down while also ensuring that feedback from the implementation team is gathered and incorporated • Hold regular (fortnightly or monthly) meetings with program teams to review progress without over-analyzing • Allocate separate budgets and heads for technology and data initiatives across all programs
Mentor Matchup
: We got quality one-on-one time with our mentors to work on our specific data challenges. Shoutout to our amazing mentor, Siddhant! He’s been a great sounding board for our ideas and has given us some solid advice on how to tackle our data challenges. We usually go on length about many of our data related issues, even those which are out of scope of this program, but Siddhant has always been patient and has given us some great advice on those as well.
Looking Ahead
We’re now back at Avanti, buzzing with ideas and eager to implement what we’ve learned. Some of the things we’re planning to do and have started work on are:
Optimize our SQL queries which are used to generate our dashboards. The queries are currently taking a lot of time to run and can be optimized further.
We’re experimenting with Dalgo to see if it can help us organize and streamline our data ingestion and transformation processes. This process is forcing us to think about the whole data flows in re-usable chunks.
We’re also working on immediate resolution for our rising BQ costs. The costs were doubling every month but have been brought under control now.
Do a re-assessment of all of our internal dashboards, taking everyone’s buy-in and feedback into account. Till now our internal dashboards and data management has usually remained in a silo. We’re planning to change that and make it more inclusive, especially for people outside the product/tech team.
As we move forward, we’re excited to put these new ideas into action and continue refining our data processes at Avanti. We’ll keep you updated on our progress and share the insights we gain along the way. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in our data journey!Title: DCP: “AI for Insights”

==================================================

“AI for Insights” was a workshop presented for Cohort 2 of the Data Catalyst Program (DCP). Its primary objective was to introduce the audience to AI-powered tools to enhance their daily workflows: how modern AI services can aid in quantitative data analysis, and in qualitative data exploration. The 90-minute session was split between these two use cases, with audience members actively engaging with the tools using their own data, and sharing their experiences with their peers.
For quantitative data analysis we looked at Julius AI, a service that allows users to upload their data then analyze it using natural language. For most audience members, it was their first time engaging with such a tool. Because they were using their own data, they had some sense for what to expect from many of their initial high-level questions. Julius made great first impressions by providing answers that were in line with their expectations. Many users were impressed that they could do advanced analytics like regression analysis; others were quite happy that they could get formatted results that met journal publication standards. One NGO was able to gain new insights into a recent social media campaign.
The qualitative data portion of the workshop introduced OpenAI’s File Search, a service that focuses Open AI LLM responses on user-defined knowledge bases. Using the service in full requires a paid Open AI account. To overcome that hurdle, we developed a custom interface to File Search using Gradio and our own OpenAI keys. Like Julius, the audience found File Search relevant and informative. It was especially encouraging to see some members use English to gain new understandings of their documents in Hindi.
Overall the session was quite productive. In addition to learning through doing, the audience was interactive amongst themselves, sharing experiences and feedback in real time. The biggest insight from AI was perhaps the importance of community and shared learning.Title: DDP – Learning from NGO’s

==================================================

The DDP team is working really hard for the last few months and we wanted to share what weve
been doing for the last quarter. So far were running three pilots on production for Sneha, Stir, and Dost Education and were constantly looking for more NGOs to onboard them for DDP.
Since were looking at more NGOs who are facing similar challenges and trying to find how Data Platform can help them with automating the whole process. Right from pulling the data from the data collection tool to getting the final data for the dashboard.
Recently weve started working with
Antarang
,
TAP
, and
SHRI.
We started by having a lot of back-and-forth conversations with them for trying to understand their use cases. Goalkeep is working with us on the Anatrang data pipeline and Im sharing the
Concept Note(Antarang)
which is written by Swapneel. I really like what GoalKeep is doing it personally. The approach is where they break down the data problems to focus on one thing the program needs to get an outcome for. Lot of learning for me to approach data problems like this.
Im working very closely with SHRI and Im going to explain what data challenges are they facing. So SHRI works in the area of Sanitation and Health Rights in India. SHRI works with local communities to improve local health and hygiene.
Current Process
Sanitation facility uses Data collected using the Kobo toolbox platform. We have APIs to pull data from each form.
Currently, R code pulls data using the API. This data is cleaned and transformed and pushed into a Google Sheet
The amount of data each API is pulling right now is around 30k at a time.
Final data is pushed to Google Sheets which is then analyzed using Google Data Studio.
Lots of manual processes are involved in the cleaning and transformation
Challenges
Significant manual intervention to have data cleaned, transformed, and pushed to analysis dashboards
Kobo’s limitations of pulling amount of data and getting around those issues
Versioning and documentation of code for cleaning and transformation
The slowness of dashboards – cause unknown at this point but could be related to Google Data Studio pulling data from Google Sheets through an API instead of from a database
Impact
No/very reduced intervention is required to keep data flowing between Kobo and Analysis dashboards
Faster iteration time to change any cleaning/transformation steps along with usage metrics.
Possibly faster dashboard loading time
Where are we
We have built the kobo toolbox connector for the airbyte which pulls raw data from the source and weve added the support for incremental sync so it can pull the latest changes.
All the data from different forms are consolidated to one place and weve started out DBT work for doing the cleaning and transformation.
Soon we will be deploying this to our staging server for testing and we will ask SHRI to look at their data for testing.Title: DDP: Recent Progress and Collaborations

==================================================

Over the past two months, we have been diligently working on our first release for the DDP platform. We are thrilled to have
Rohit
, our Director of Engineering, leading the engineering efforts. At Project Tech4Dev, we strongly believe in the power of open source and aim to make everything we do public. Therefore, codebase are public and we welcome anyone to contribute on it. Throughout the development process, we strive to adhere to best practices and ensure high-quality code.
In order to maintain a high standard, we have begun focusing on writing extensive test cases to cover all the features developed by the engineering team. We have set a rigorous threshold that we are committed to upholding.
Abhishek Shetty
is focusing on backend testing and making sure that weve quality test cases. On the other hand
Ishan
is our alround developer and leading the
TAP engagement
.
As our organization continues to grow, we have recognized the need for better structuring. We are delighted to welcome
Abhishek Nair
as our Product Manager, whose presence has brought about significant improvements in our features and focused efforts for the development team. Since his arrival, we have made notable enhancements to several aspects of our work.
Let�s talk about where we are with our POCs
We have worked on Six proof-of-concept (POC) projects with the assistance of our partner,
Goalkeep
. The POCs with
STiR
,
Antarang
,
DOST Education
, and
TAP
have been completed. Currently, we are collaborating with
SHRI
to transition the project to them, enabling them to start analyzing their data. We have encouraged them to utilize their own data warehouse, and Vinod has been instrumental in facilitating the transfer of data from Kobo to their warehouse. This strategic move holds immense long-term significance as it reduces the effort required on their part to maintain data in Google Sheets.
In addition, we are engaged in multiple projects with
SNEHA.
Goalkeep and Vinod are providing support for certain components, while Sneha has recently hired a new data engineer. we’re assisting the data engineer with all the technical work required for these projects.
Were also doing a deep dive with
LAHI
and trying to understand there program really well. After lot of research and discussions we have proposed a
POC
work with them. We will be soon start working with them.
To read more about our last few engagements

SHRI ongoing POC work
Next step with the POCs
Currently, all the proof-of-concepts (POCs) we have undertaken are set up on separate infrastructures, and we are assisting NGOs with their implementation. However, our long-term goal is to provide a comprehensive product that enables NGOs to easily manage their own pipelines, transformations, and orchestrations. Our next steps will involve handing over the pipeline management to the NGOs and providing them with training to effectively handle these pipelines.
Were doing a DDP sprint starting from 11th July to 14th July. One of our main focus will be to introduce the 0.1 version to all the NGOs and give them a sense of what weve been doing from last 8 to 9 months. We also need to make a strong pitch to our NGOs who will be using this in long run and why its worth it.Title: Dabbling in the Indian Social Sector

==================================================

This post was originally written and published by Radhika Bhagwat
here
.
Few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a conversation, that opened up a wealth of more connections for me. This really proved to me how the conventional way to search for a new job or passively applying to job postings doesnt come anywhere close to having active conversations and creating connections you never imagined you could have.
I emailed
Donald Lobo
on a Friday evening, and heard back from him almost instantly flying back to SF from India. Can meet over the weekend, once I land. This was the fastest Id heard from anyone Id reached out to so far in the last 8 months (cold reach-outs). I was excited and humbled to hear back from Lobo (as he is famously called). A friend of a friend had mentioned Lobo, as someone who is working on bringing open source technology to the Indian social sector. I read up on his private foundation
Chintu Gudiya Foundation
and its work with
Project Tech4Dev
, before I met him for a virtual coffee the following week. Lobo himself was in the tech industry until the early 2000s, before he moved to the social sector and started his private foundation. I was struck by Lobos humility and generosity. He shared tons of information with me on the first meeting, how his Tech initiative functioned, what products they have developed and more.
The same week, I received invitation to attend
Give-Indiaspora event
(thanks to Atul Satija) at Stanford. The event had the whos who of the Indian development sector. Lobo was on the panel for climate philanthropy. The respect and following Lobo had in this event was impressive. He also took it upon himself to introduce me to a couple dozen people in the event, most of whom were founders or CEOs of non-profits working in or impacting India!!
I learnt about several initiatives like
Goonj
, founded by
Anshu Gupta
, the India Literacy Program (ILP), managed in US as a volunteer by
Padmaja
,
Project Echo
, founded by
Sanjeev Arora
,
Mentor Together
, founded by
Arundhuti Gupta
,
Udhyam Learning Foundation
, founded by
Mekin Maheshwari
, The
India Inclusion Foundation
, founded by
Ferose V. R.
, CEO of Give North America
Ashish Shah
, and
Give.do
and
The/Nudge Institute
, founded by
Atul Satija
. The climate action talk, by Dr. Arun Majumdar, Dean of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, concluded the event, and was thought provoking (less than 20 years left on this Earth if we carry on like this!!!). I even got to meet
Kivas
CEO,
Vishal Ghotge
, and convey my appreciation for the initiatives Kiva has kick-started with refugee loans, and corporate partnerships, under his leadership. Id had at least 25 conversations in a day, cause of this event, which otherwise would take me 6 months!!
Following couple of weeks, I continued to be invited by Lobo, to meet with some of the folks I had connected with in the event. I got to know a lot more about Anshu and his teams impact with
Goonj
, and the challenges they faced during COVID and post-COVID. Anshu is a Ashoka and Schwab Fellow and Magsaysay Awardee, who founded
Goonj
almost 25 years ago. At the event, he urged philanthropists to go beyond their conventional barrier of validating the right non-profit, and give with faith and kindness in their hearts. He stressed givers to visit the NGOs on the ground in India and feel the impact they bring in-spite of the challenges they face. I certainly plan to visit Goonj this year, when I visit India. I also met several like-minded people like
Pranay
and
Sanjeev Dharap
, and Vinod, working alongside Lobo in Tech4Dev.
Since Tech4Dev work is open source, the code is on Github and most documents are on google drive. This made it so easy for me to start engaging and observing their work, and getting involved. Lobo invited me to three different non-profit meetings, where they intended to deep dive and learn about the non-profits challenges. I was even more excited about these calls because all of them were working to bring equity in education specially for girls in the rural parts of India. Their challenges mounted from being able to chart out areas or villages where girls arent coming to school, to keeping attendance, collecting data consistently and being able to derive inferences through visualization of metrics. Since India has a good portion of its rural parts outside of internet coverage, real-time data collection is a challenge, paired with field cadres who are not as tech-savvy, and still prefer using pen-paper to record information. On top of this, since non-profits are constraint on resources, maintaining tech apps and data is not their forte. This is where Tech4Dev comes in and helps bootstrap the process of data collection, transformation, security and visualization for the non-profits, using open source tools they develop and maintain, like
Glific
and
Dalgo
.
I look forward to learning more in the next few weeks as I join Tech4Dev in their sprint off-site at
Kochi, Kerala.
Super thrilled!!Title: Dalgo Engineering’s Journey on the AI road
Author: Ishan Koradia
Date: August 2025

==================================================

In an attempt to evolve Dalgo as a product, we have experimented with various features like chat with your data, summarize your “filtered” dataset in a warehouse, parse pipeline failures into easy-to-understand summaries, etc.
Some of these have made it into production, but are not being used by our end users as much as we expected them to, and some others didn’t go beyond the experimental stage. However, this journey made us realize that our end users are more interested in fundamental capabilities like KPIs, metrics, reporting, dashboards, etc. Ashwin has beautifully articulated Dalgo’s evolution in
this read
.
Pivoting in this direction of building dashboards, reports, metrics/KPIs natively in Dalgo, we wanted to understand what level of assistance we can get from AI tools out there. Can these tools help us knock things off our roadmap in less time? I was skeptical.
This is just like chatgpt for devs
I have been using Co-Pilot to assist in my day-to-day development work for the past few months now, but it was just like “ChatGpting” in your VSCode; it was nothing revolutionary.
I used it to ask questions about an issue/bug, or to refactor a piece of code to make it readable & maybe use fewer lines, or to suggest alternate approaches for a logic I had implemented, etc. It was not bad, it did a pretty decent job, especially for all infra/devops-related questions around AWS & Kubernetes.
Some of my questions/prompts to co-pilot
“I want to set up a VPC peer connection between two VPCs in AWS. How do i go about it ?”
“Can you re-write this code to use list comprehension in python ?”
“Write test cases for this function”
“This is the error <…..error lines….> I see in my console. What could be the issue ?”
“Generate a function that builds a query using sqlalchemy to fetch data based on this config…”
Some of the simpler questions were answered correctly while others needed more context or some back & forth before reaching the expected outcome.
From chatgpting to agentic tools
We then went on to try agentic tools like Cursor and/or co-pilot (agent mode). Our workflow became more aggressive in the sense that we started asking these tools to build full functionality with some context around it.
We built an internal tool called “Dbt Project Manager” to help our consulting team automate their dbt (a tool used to set up SQL transformations) workflows. This was fully built using Cursor. It did a decent job in terms of scaffolding and setting up the initial project structure. The UI was also pretty neat.
We asked Cursor to set up the UI layout first and then iterated multiple times to pump out functionalities one by one, frontend and backend. We did see some improvement in time saved, but maybe not a lot.
However, as the codebase evolved & the complexity increased, it felt like fighting with the Cursor rather than building. If you ask it to do one thing, it would break 5 other things in other places. It got very frustrating.
We also used Cursor to help us build our v0 prototype or a functionality of it (i.e., charts). It did a similar job as the previous project. I started to contemplate whether we were using the tool correctly. I started questioning. How are other people using it? Why are they so happy & excited about these tools? Is there a different approach to this? Could it have performed better with more context?
From agentic tools to context engineering
When Claude Code released its “Opus” model, you all might have heard people going crazy and sharing on social media what they had built with it. We, too, got curious and wanted to see how good this was.
We decided to go all in and give AI one more chance. But this time our approach was to figure out the right development workflow. After watching a lot of YouTube videos on people explaining their workflows with Claude code, we realized that we are missing 3 things: “context”, “context”, and “context”.
After experimenting for a few days, we were able to use Claude Code to push out multiple PRs in much less time. The PRs covered easy-level & medium-level features/enhancements. Our workflow with Claude Code looks like this (Git repo
here
with various files)
Spend a decent amount of time planning the feature. This should include high-level architecture, data flow, low-level design, schema design, api design, etc. I like to call this step “Code in English words”
Use the above spec and ask Claude to generate a detailed implementation plan. This is a step where developers can nudge Claude to think in the direction that they want it to go.
Once the plan is approved by a human/developer/us, we let Claude do its magic.
Review the code generated by Claude
Claude did a surprisingly good job here. It got the entire functionality close to being 95% accurate & in working condition. This was the “Aha” moment that I had been waiting for. You can see in the repo linked above the level of detail that we had to specify and the extensive implementation plan Claude came up with.
I think people might be wondering, This is all good and exciting, but how much time did it save? We are in the early stages of answering that question, but some rough estimates & thoughts around this
Claude did a medium-level feature in about half the time that a good developer with enough context about the code base would have taken.
Time is being saved because we went from
writing specs + coding + debugging + reviewing to specs + debugging/reviewing.
Since the AI agent is working on different parts of the codebase, like frontend & backend, the time required to coordinate efforts to integrate these parts is saved.
Way forward
Context is the new oil
Context for an AI agent doesn’t just mean a dump of some Word document(s). It means structured in a way that guides the agent to do specific tasks on your behalf. Imagine how far we have come from machine-level coding to languages like C, C++, to Python, and now to writing contexts.
We (engineers) are nowhere close to being replaced
Yes, you heard that right. I don’t think we are going anywhere anytime soon. Our working style will & has evolved for sure. The next set of skills for us becomes planning, architecture, product engineering, debugging, and reviewing.
Embrace rather than envy
Are we saying we are better than a model trained on millions of repos, which is equivalent to a few hundred thousand developer brains? I don’t see a good reason for developers not to embrace AI tools like Claude
Keep human in the loop
I will never be able to trust code generated by AI 100% any time soon. I believe it is a good practice to review the AI agent’s work at every stage. Nothing should go directly into production.
Context engineering is replacing vibe coding
I just like the word context engineering better than vibe coding. By giving the agent more context we are just fine tuning it for the task at hand. You cannot ask it to just build an ETL platform with a nice UI. Even if it works, it will not be something you had in mind.
Being calculatively ambitious
Although, seemingly, the agentic tools are doing a great job with enough context. But since we are in our early stages of using them, we should take time validating/testing/debugging/doing quality checks to make sure the code generated is production-ready. That being said, we should be more aggressive on the features we plan to deliver in our dev cycles.
If we keep developing this way, are we going to just forget the low-level details of the codebase? That might just happen, too. We need to make sure, every now and then, we get our hands dirty deep in the codebase to take an “AI break”.
Anecdotes from our team
“As a software developer, I’ve been using AI (Cursor and CodeRabbit) for coding, refactoring, generating tests, and generating scripts that automate repetitive tasks. During Spike Week, we were able to rapidly spike a chart feature which otherwise would have taken a minimum 4 weeks.”
– Himanshu
“It would have taken me 2 weeks just to understand the backend and frontend Dalgo repositories, but with Forgecode and Claude, within 20 minutes I was already developing.”
– Pratiksha
“I had no idea we could do so much in so little time and with such ease. Planning is more fun now because now you get to order around a bunch of developers (agents)”

Author: Ashwini Lotlikar
Date: March 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dalgo-product-roadmap/
==================================================

Dalgo, our Open Source data development platform, was released in September 2023. This platform was born out of the common need to build capability in handling the data coming from multiple channels, for further analysis. The data transformation work being done with the non-profits like SNEHA, SHRI and Dost education saw a common pattern, which further got productised into Dalgo, low code, open source SAAS platform. Dalgo has helped our clients to streamline their data pipelining and dash-boarding process, by eliminating some of the manual effort in consolidating data and thus assisting them in data driven decision making.
We see a growing demand for the platform in the sector as well as newer requirements coming from our existing clients. While we have been working with most of them on the data consolidation and dash-boarding, some have advanced requirements like  governance, identifying data patterns, platform extensions etc.  While we build the product roadmap, our goal is mainly to cater to the following
Prioritizing Customer Requirements
Increase platform adoption
Align to New Technology Trends that matter
Before we present the product roadmap, it is important to know who is a Dalgo user? Or what are the skills required to use the platform? While prioritising the features we have considered the user to be
NGO User with basic or no SQL skills but M&E skills.
And the user can further be described as someone who
Knows what data the organisation is collecting, what insights they need to generate, how often and for whom.
Has some familiarity with data for dashboards, reporting, M&E and programmatic requirements.
Is not familiar with SQL or Github or having basic understanding/familiarity with SQL or Github
Dalgo product roadmap for this (Q4 2023-24) and the upcoming quarter(Q1 2024-25) is primarily focussed on the following themes, keeping in mind our user.
Platform Usability
– to ensure ease of use of the platform
Data Privacy and Governance
– practices of sharing data across the organisation
Data Quality
– assess the quality of ingested data for freshness, anomalies etc
Continuous improvements
– ensuring the underlying components are up-to-date
The features based on these themes will help strengthen the foundation of our platform, thus making it easy for us to extend these capabilities further.
Dalgo
Roadmap
As we work on these enhancements for the platform, we would like to invite interested NGOs to signup as early validators(beta) for our platform. If interested, do leave a note below or write to us at support@dalgo.in

Author: Mohd Shamoon
Date: May 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dalgo-bangalore-team-meetup/
==================================================

I recently joined the Dalgo team, and this was my first team meetup in Bangalore. Previously, I worked on Glific.
For context,
Glific
and
Dalgo
are both products under the Tech4dev umbrella. Transitioning from one team to another takes time to adjust, and comparisons are inevitable, but more on that later.
Since most of the Dalgo team members are in Bangalore, we chose to host the sprint there. Only Abhishek Nair and I were from outside Bangalore, flying in from different places and arriving on Monday for the sprint. I came a little earlier as I had some other commitments.
It was a four-day sprint from 7th-10th May. We had specific objectives, and there were discussions about whether an in-person sprint would be worth it since everything can be done remotely. After spending four days together, almost all of us felt it was indeed worth it.
We missed you Ishan 🙂
The Sessions that took place
DBT test packages
used in consulting work by siddhant
Siddhant showed us various libraries used to validate data before the transformation step. These were quite easy to configure and provided a good base for adding simple validations like:
expect_column_to_exist
expect_table_column_count_to_equal_other_table
These validations seemed quite useful for his consulting work. The team also gained a good understanding of these libraries and began considering data validation features in Dalgo.
Rohit�s session on development overview and challenges
Rohit explained how the entire platform is set up and how we use Airbyte to ingest data from multiple connectors. Since the NGOs we work with use different input data sources like Survey CTO, CommCare, and Avni, we had to build unique connectors for them. Airbyte has some default connectors, but it didn’t include the ones we needed. We contributed these connectors to the Airbyte codebase; some have been accepted, while others are still pending, which we use as custom connectors.
For each organization in Dalgo, we create a separate workspace in Airbyte and add all the connectors for that workspace, including custom ones. We can update connectors separately in each workspace without having to do it globally for all clients.
We also discussed why we use multiple secret managers (Amazon and Google), how DBT blocks are created, what information is stored in them, and how they are used.
Consulting learnings from siddhant and abhishek
One key point highlighted was that consulting had helped improve one of our product’s (Avni) API performance. Other discussions revolved around defining a good scope of work and better estimating timelines and deliverables.
Overall, these sessions gave me a lot of insight into Dalgo as a platform and how it is used by organizations.
NGO visits and meetup
We visited Arghyam on the first day, a non-profit organization based in Bangalore that supports sustainable water and sanitation solutions, and worked from their office. Visiting them helped us in moving forward our discussions faster with them on the work we need do.
The next day, we visited Noora Health’s office. The office was amazing, and the people working there seemed very happy with their work. I loved the food and the canteen they had.
I feel we did not make most of it by visiting the NGOs office as most of the time we were working in isolation with the NGO people in a separate room
For the remaining two days, we visited two coworking spaces: BHive and WeWork, both excellent places. It was nice to work with the team in person. You can discuss and ask questions easily since you’re in the same room; otherwise, you have to schedule a call and wait unnecessarily for messages.
On the engineering side, we discussed the schema change detection requirements.
Lunch and Outings
Every day, we went to lunch as a team. I loved Rameshwaram Cafe, especially the Ghee Pudi Idli they had. I still miss it. South Indian food is the best.
I spent some good time with the other team members: Siddhant, Abhishek, and Abhishek N daily after work, we visited multiple cafes and places in Bangalore.
As a team, I feel these kinds of sprints, especially when working remotely, help bring the team closer and make us more productive, allowing us to learn from each other and share experiences.Title: Dalgo feature update – a fresh UI for data transformation
Author: Ishan Koradia
Date: March 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dalgo-feature-update-a-fresh-ui-for-data-transformation/
==================================================

Our Dalgo team has been working very hard for the past few weeks and we are excited to announce a new user interface (UI) that allows people to build their data pipelines by just clicking a few buttons. This UI will help you do various transformations on your data, build production ready tables for visualization and save valuable time & effort from writing sql queries. If you are interested in trying this feature please reach out to us at
support@dalgo.in
, we are looking for beta users to test this out & provide their feedback. Below is the sneak peek of how the feature looks like.
Motivation
Based on our conversations with NGOs during the previous sprints & in our consulting engagements, we found that most Monitoring & Evaluation teams (MnE) in NGOs working with data do not have the necessary SQL or GitHub skills required to set up their pipelines independently on Dalgo. In addition to this, data transformation requirement(s) for an NGO keep evolving which makes them dependent on us (or the organization they are consulting with) for support. We want the NGOs to be able to use the Dalgo platform with little or no dependency and hence the idea of having a UI for transformation started gaining traction in our team. Over the course of next few weeks, (i.e. month of December & January), the product team had come up with a feature specification which was reviewed & finalized during our Goa (end of January) sprint.
Target users
The feature aims to target the members of the MnE (Monitoring & Evaluation) team of an NGO that might have very little SQL or some basic SQL skills. With that being said, the user must have a sound understanding of how data should be transformed to reach the desired output. For example, if I have a table with two columns NGO & SPOC (single point of contact). Lets say, I want to figure out how many NGOs are being handled by each SPOC, I would need to aggregate the table against the column SPOC and count the distinct names of NGO.
Another set of users that the feature does not necessarily target are people having advanced SQL skills. We found that they would prefer writing sql queries rather than using a UI to do it. Although i believe, this feature could reduce their development time significantly.
Usability
The feature offers a workflow window where a user is directed from the transform section in their Dalgo accounts.
The workflow window is divided into three sections.
The main canvas where users can see and build their pipeline.
The left side section shows all tables under their respective schemas fetched from the warehouse
The panel at the bottom has a preview window to look at the data inside any table. It also has a logs tab that will show the status of a pipeline in progress.
Currently, the feature supports 14 SQL transformation functions that one can use to build their pipeline. Users can also chain functions on top of another as shown below. To terminate the chain and Create a Table, all one needs to do is press that button on the right side panel. This will run the pipeline and show logs in the LOGS tab below.
As one can see below, the output table was materialized and is also present in your warehouse now. With just a few clicks, I was able to build a simple pipeline that drops some column(s) and renames a column. One can apply more advanced data transformations by using more complex SQL functions.�
Architecture
Our core transformation logic lies in an independent python package created by us which you can find
here
(dbt-automation, support bigquery/postgres) .This package is responsible for generating the sql logic for each function/operation and writing it to a file. The package also has the ability to return the output columns that one would see, without actually running/executing the sql for the operation.
The dbt-automation package also has the capability of chaining operations which we were able to achieve by using SQL
ctes
. For example, if a user has chained drop function, a rename function and a coalesce function one after the another; then the package will do this
Wrap the drop sql logic in cte1
Use the output of cte1 to generate rename sql logic and wrap this in cte2
Use the output of cte2 to generate coalesce sql logic and wrap this in cte3
Return cte3 as output of the chained transformation
Apart from generating sql logic, it also connects to a warehouse or data storage to fetch information like rows of a table, data types of a column, schemas in a warehouse etc. Any service using this package doesn’t have to worry about the type of warehouse they are connecting to. What this means is that warehouse_client.get_schemas() will do the same for Bigquery as well as Postgres, i.e. fetch schema names. The underlying motivation of doing this is code to interface rather than implement. This package will support new warehouse types as when Dalgo starts supporting it.
Dalgo’s django backend uses the above package to serve the request for chaining operations, saving/creating a table and running operations. The backend also takes care of generating/storing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to render the pipeline in the canvas. To store the DAG all we had to do was create two new tables/migrations. One table to store the directed edge (from source to target) and another to store the nodes which are the sql models generated (& lying on the disk) when the user hits Create a Table. The backend only supports deletion of leaf nodes since deleting the node in the middle of the chain would break your pipeline.
The frontend uses a package called
reactflow
to render the canvas and a layouting library called
DagreJS
to space out the nodes in the most optimum fashion. The three major components (side panel for warehouse tables, canvas & the bottom panel for preview/logs) of the workflow screen share common state via the custom hooks created using
useContext
. When a user is chaining operations via the option of Add function, the frontend takes care of adding the function nodes in the canvas. The canvas is not refreshed until the user has terminated the chain by materializing it into a chain. Once the table is materialized, users can see the columns and their data types inside the node. Each table node, asks the backend for this (column name & data types) information which is served by an api that uses the dbt-automation package.
Dalgo future roadmap
We have some exciting features planned in the next 6 months that will help users to get a better understanding of their data, setup role-based access on the platform, perform quality checks on their data and take advantage of LLMs.Title: Dalgo’s Upcoming Feature: Data Statistics
Author: Glific Admin
Date: June 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dalgos-upcoming-feature-data-statistics/
==================================================

Imagine this: You’re building a transformation pipeline using
Dalgo?s UI
. You want to investigate a particular model after transformation to understand its contents better. Previously, you could only preview the data in a table form. Now, we’ve taken a significant step forward to enhance your experience and understanding of your data.
Introducing Data Statistics
Data Statistics provides an easy way to analyze your data and gain valuable insights. Here’s a quick demo of the feature:
Table Insights:
Total Rows:
The total number of rows in your data.
Total Columns:
The total number of columns in your data.
Column-Specific Insights:
Data Type:
The type of data in the column (e.g., String, Datetime, Integer, Boolean).
Distinct Values:
The number of unique values in the column.
Null Values:
The count of null values in the column.
Data Distribution:
Visual representation of data distribution.
Supported Charts for Each Data Type:
String:
Visuals that help you understand the distribution and uniqueness of string values.
Datetime:
Charts to visualize time-based data and trends.
Integer:
Graphs to display numeric data distribution.
Boolean:
Representation of true/false values.
This feature aims to empower users to make better-informed decisions when creating their pipelines.
Currently, Data Statistics will only available in Dalgo?s UI for transformation. However, we are considering extending this feature to the GitHub method based on user demand.
For future versions, we plan to enhance this feature further based on your feedback. We also aim to add support for Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize data and generate comprehensive reports.
Stay tuned for more updates, and let us know how we can make this feature even better for you!Title: Dam Desilting Mission App Goes Live

An image uploaded by a user from the app at start of desilting work
On 21st March we made the app available to be used on field by users to record desilting data of more than 2600 waterbodies across 21 districts in Maharashtra to be done by approximately 1250 users. At the time of publishing this update, about 60 users have actively started using the app.
A reporting and analytics dashboard is also provided to the project management team with benchmark indicators like the following along with their threshold/goal values
Amount of silt excavated
Rate of silt removal
Rate of work completion
Silt removal efficiency (JCB and Poclain)
Fuel efficiency (JCB and Poclain)
Average working hours per machine per day (JCB and Poclain)
Average silt per acre of land
Number of villages benefitted
Number of farmers benefitted
https://youtu.be/KMPA8jFILP0
Benchmark dashboard based on data from the app
KPMG, which is monitoring the overall desilting project on behalf of Government of Maharashtra and working closely with the stakeholders including funders and NGOs in different districts, is using the reports and analytics to provide reports to all stakeholders as well as streamlining adoption and usage of the app.
Collaborative work of KPMG, Web Access and Samanvay
KPMG is the client for this app. Web Access being in Mumbai helped in understanding requirements and identifying OpenCHS as the solution and ensuring that the project remains within constraints of timlines, scope and budget. Samanvay OpenCHS team took up the challenge of adapting OpenCHS product for this usecase and delivering in a short span of time.
The collaborative effort with spliting of responsibilities helped in achieving the effectiveness and efficiency this project demanded.
Development work: OpenCHS Product enhancements and implementation work
OpenCHS team at Samanvay added the needed features to the product – mainly supporting case management of non-humans, video and image upload and geolocation tracking. Samanvay also did the implementation work of creating forms and reports required in this project. The geographical hierarchy, waterbodies, and users were imported as data. As part of user acceptance testing, the app was initially made available to KPMG, Web Access, and 10 pilot users. The feedback from this UAT phase was incorporated and then the app released for wide usage.
The reporting dashboard is built using Metabase an open-source product used by OpenCHS. Metabase also allows user to do further analysis on top of the reports provided.
The implementation code is open sourced and can be found on github
here
.
The reports are documented
here
.
Pointers to OpenCHS product, documentation, demo, source code and more can be found

Usage on field and feedback
Since the ‘Go Live’, the app has been getting rolled out in different districts as the NGOs responsible in respective districts are starting the desilting work and also adopting the app.
The users have so far found the app easy to use. As part of the baseline form to be filled at the start of the work, users are supposed to upload images and a 10-20 sec video showcasing the site and start of work. One such image and video are added to this post.
But its not that everything has been a cakewalk. Some users faced challenges understanding how to login. Feedback has also been coming from the field due to scenarios relating to some users not comfortable with mobile and human resource problems at the NGOs as well as some usability confusions leading to users performing wrong data entry. KPMG and Web access are working on providing solutions through training, process and workarounds. This is the first time that OpenCHS is getting used at this scale that too with users who have not undergone any training for the app. OpenCHS team is keenly listening to the feedback and making changes to product backlog.
Next Steps
From OpenCHS perspective all the requirements have been closed and the project has entered into a support phase. Requests like additions of new users and some data fixes are being handled as support tickets. The need for continuous user addition was anticipated and hence a User management will also be soon released.
Correlating with Tracker data : There is one more requirement pending from KPMG which is to be able to co-relate and cross check the data entered by users in the app with the data provided by trackers attached to vehicles at the site. There are APIs available from both OpenCHS and the tracker vendor exposing relevant data. Web access is working on providing a solution for this.

==================================================

For the previous blog check:
https://chintugudiya.org/dam-desilting-mission-app-goes-live/
The Galmukt Dharan Galyukt Shivar aka Dam Desilting Mission project was completed a part of the last tech4dev cohort. We had a Program Review and Strategy Workshop with Soil and Water Conservation Department, Government for all the stakeholders of this program. This included Government officials, NGO partners, Funders of the project and technology partners.
Here are some of the stats:
Overall
OpenCHS
mobile app was widely used by all the NGO partners to collect the desilting data. We were able to get the realtime data about desilting and other stats. The mobile app worked nicely without any major glitches.
This meeting was a nice experience. It was my first interaction dealing directly with the Government officials and it was super impressive. I was amazed by the level of clarity they had about the program and their willingness to learn and move forward.
We will be meeting with KPMG team to get the feedback on the app and evaluate how it can be used for 2020 implementation.Title: Dam Desilting Project update

==================================================

Dam Desilting Mission caters as a monitoring platform for Gaalmukta
Dharan Gaalyukta Shivaar (GDGS) scheme of Government of Maharashtra.
As per GDGS scheme, silt is removed from water storage structures and this silt is made available to farmers free of cost. Farmers can cart this silt and spread it in their farms. As a result, there is an increase in water storage capacity of the water body, increase in percolation rate of water and improvement in soil fertility of the farmland. As per the scheme, farmers are required to carry silt from the water body to respective farms at their own expense while the Government provides funding for diesel required for desilting. Rental of machines required for desilting are required to be arranged through community contribution or through other sources such as CSR and philanthropic funds. The PPPP implementation model of the scheme ? Public, Private and People Partnership has been instrumental in creating the intended impact and ensures holistic involvement of each of the stakeholder.
There is a need of mobile app to capture all the activities
related to desilting. The primary activities includes:
Ability to add Dam
Record Desilting data against the dam
Record machines working  on the site
JCB details
Poclain data
Ability to record Beneficially data. i.e.
Farmers
We evaluated few options to implements this project and zeroed down to use OpenCHS. OpenCHS aims to be a comprehensive community health platform designed to empower health workers with supportive supervision of the clinicians.  Although this is being currently used in health sector we thought it could be generalise to meet this projects requirements. Hence, we are working with
Samanvay Foundation
the organization behind OpenCHS to make the platform generic so that it could be used by this and many more projects.
Few enhancements done to OpenCHS platform includes:
Ability to manage generic entities like Dam,
Nala etc
Added support for Videos

==================================================

DPW was my introduction not only to Dasra but also to the Tech4Dev team. Over the two weeks leading up to DPW I had met almost everyone over various video meetings. But these were to be my first face-to-face interactions.
Please pack a shirt, my wife said to me. And trousers.
The venue was beautiful – a tall building with glass walls, shiny floors and so much space. The Dasra folk were professional and organized and made sure everything ran smoothly. When one of us (it was Arjun) walked on the art they came over and politely asked us not to. Its an art piece said the man, please dont walk on it.
Well why does it look like a staircase then
, we were smart enough not to say out loud.
For someone relatively new to the sector, what I was glad (and what I expected) to see, was that people were palpably passionate about what they were doing. Yes there are hurdles, and yes there is frustration but at the same time, in the development sector the chances of being able to impact our world and other people in it are just so much higher.
I met a gentleman from Kashmir who works with a centre for people with disabilities. The founder, he was telling me, is now 90 years old and semi-retired but he still shows up to work every day. This founder built the organization from the ground up, getting land, funding, staff, equipment what a feeling it must be to be able to look back on your life and see such a thing. Oh, and on the side he also wrote an ENT textbook which is used in medical colleges.
With regard to our own Tech4Dev sessions there were no real surprises, I felt they were well attended and I found our guests engaged and attentive. Technology frightens and frustrates everyone (even outside of the development sector!) and Ive always found audiences to be appreciative when they feel like you want to help them. Im very glad to have found a team who are in a position to deliver this type of support, and to such a deserving target group.Title: Dasra x Data Catalyst Program
Author: Abhishek Nair
Date: October 2023
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dasra-x-data-catalyst-program/
==================================================

This blog is written by Nirali Trivedi from Dasra
During our interactions with non-profits, philanthropists, intermediaries and academia at
Dasra
, we noticed a dire need for building capacities of NGOs specifically when it comes to data. Data literacy; having resource constraints; lack of spaces for collaboration and peer learning focused on data, are some of the common challenges we identified, and wanted to do something to solve for – hence the Data Catalyst Program came at the perfect time for us. On a personal note, my interest in harnessing the potential of data and technology to catalyze real-world impact found a perfect outlet in this partnership of Dasra, Project Tech4Dev, Goalkeep & The Agency Fund – allowing me the opportunity to strategize, innovate, listen deeply, & learn.
In the lead-up to these two workshop days in Kochi, the atmosphere was charged with excitement and focus.
Day 0
was dedicated to laying the groundwork and ensuring the comfortable integration of our NGO participants. The energy was a blend of uncertainty, nervous anticipation, and genuine excitement, as our agenda encompassed a wide array of topics  spanning from data leadership to data culture to  LLMs and AI to data collection & privacy.
The day commenced with an ice-breaker exercise arranged by the Dasra team. Our aim was to prompt participants to conceive three distinctive data points that could serve as an introduction to themselves. These data points could range from personal preferences such as favorite foods to particulars like their hometown. After contemplation and data point selection, participants put down their chosen pieces of information and crafted two-line introductory sentences based on their selected data points.
During the ice breaker session
However, what truly elevated this exercise was the collective transformation of these individual narratives into a single, imaginative group story. Thus, we embarked on our journey, transforming a collection of diverse data points into a shared story that mirrored the diversity of our cohort.
Day 1
kicked off with NGOs sharing their data stories, which isn’t easy, given that summarizing years of hard work in just 10 minutes is a challenge. But our NGOs pulled it off, explaining what they’ve been doing, how they’ve been doing it, and why it matters.
TAP Team presenting their data story
One remarkable session was facilitated by Goalkeep. They divided us into groups and presented a simulation exercise where we were tasked with creating an action plan and evaluating the data strategy of the “North Star Foundation.” I must confess that this exercise seemed exciting, albeit slightly daunting. However, as I delved into it with my fellow team members, Rob and Vinod, I discovered it to be surprisingly manageable. The exercise was aptly named the “Data Culture Simulation,” and I used logic to approach it much like solving a test paper. I did consider what kind of data strategy would be the most inclusive, involving the voices of not just the leadership but many others within the organization.
We progressed as we moved on to the session focusing on building data-leaders of tomorrow by Dasra, where the emphasis was on managing the softer aspects of leading data strategy within organizations. This session was followed by parallel worktime sessions  one led by the Dasra team in which the participants got on a hypothetical train journey of 1.5 hours to go through the FAST (Fundraising, Articulation & Negotiation, Stakeholder Management, and Team Building). Given Dasras work on building NGO leadership through the Dasra Social Impact (DSI) Programs over the past years, we were able to connect with the participants and start a candid conversation around challenges faced by them in their respective roles. The other session facilitated by the Tech4Dev & Goalkeep teams, guided the participants on areas such as data collection, visualization, and kickstarted working on their 3 month action plan. Observing the Tech4Dev PoCs and teams engaging in one-on-one interactions with the participants, diligently dissecting the problem statements, articulating goals, and devising strategies to achieve them, was truly inspiring.

Day 2
stands out for me, especially due to my inclination towards structured frameworks. Rob’s session on data-driven decision-making – breaking down a program into a “user funnel,” where it’s segmented from the candidate state to the impacted state – provided valuable insights.
I’d like to give a special mention to Edmund. I consider ChatGPT to be a modern-day best friend and I had no idea ChatGPT-4 could perform the tasks demonstrated in his demo, and it seems many of our participants shared that sentiment based on their feedback. Edmund’s use of Indian food dishes and ingredients in his live demo was highly appreciated. It showcased his effort in contextualizing the session for our specific audience (yes, we’re always eager for a good Indian meal!)
The 2 day workshop concluded with Kavneet leading the participants through a sort of “reflection meditation.” She encouraged them to revisit the past two days in their minds and share their immediate thoughts.
Last day of the workshop
Some reflections:
–
The power of deep listening & unlearning
: Regardless of an organization’s maturity or an individual’s experience, there is a wealth of knowledge to gain and even more to shed through unlearning.
–
There are (data) miles to go before we sleep:
Always inspiring to hear NGO leaders talk about the work they do  setting aside dedicated 2 days to upskill themselves on data for impact, demonstrates their commitment to driving positive change.
–
It takes 4 to transform ideas into action
: While Dasra & Project Tech4Dev initially partnered to set the groundwork, having Goalkeep and The Agency Fund as knowledge partners solidified the foundation of our program, and we are grateful for the synergies the four organizations could tap into, to finally come up with the first 2-day workshop of the first cohort of the Data Catalyst Program.
Looking forward to the conversations with our cohort over the next 3 months leading up to the eagerly awaited workshop in January 2024 (with a sincere intention to make it for Lobos 6:00 am walks!)Title: Data Catalyst Program – Another Tech4Dev Experimental Initiative

==================================================

2023 has been quite an eventful year for the team at Project Tech4Dev. In addition to growing the team significantly, we are also starting to see and thread problems across the sector. Love the vantage point we have across the Indian social sector and truly grateful to our NGO partners for being so open and sharing with us. A common refrain from folks outside the ecosystem, is how NGOs in the sector do not collaborate, I recommend they come sit with us for a few days to see the strength and power of the collaborative ecosystem 🙂
Our platforms:
Glific
,
Avni
and
Dalgo
have a focus on on-boarding as many NGOs as possible at relatively low cost. Hence our close interaction with most of these NGOs (beyond the onboarding and initial setup) is fairly limited. On the flip side, our
Fractional CxO
program is a highly intensive (half time typically) 6-9 month engagement with medium-large NGOs. We had enough data points from both these interactions, to realize the need for a program around data in general and
responsible technology + data
in specific.
We started off by having conversations and explorations with some of the organizations in the space. These included:
Data.org
,
PJMF Data Accelerator
,
Aapti Institute
,
Digital Futures Lab
,
Omidyar Network India
,
D4GX India
/
Dasra
,
GoalKeep
and
Agency Fund
. We also had lots of conversations across different NGOs in our ecosystem, during
Tech4Dev sprints
and different in-person gatherings. Building a data platform gave us a deeper insight into the data use case within the NGOs piloting Dalgo.
Based on these conversations and discussions, we felt it was the right time and space to introduce the
Data Catalyst Program
– a cohort based approach to help NGOs use, manage, process and analyze data. We also did not know enough about the subject matter to run this cohort by ourselves. So, we invited some of our ecosystem partners: Dasra, GoalKeep and Agency Fund to help us design and run this cohort. This was a great group of partners:
Dasra brings in their expertise and experience of running cohorts over the past decade, along with insights and educating NGOs from a strategic and organizational lens
Goalkeep brings in their expertise from a Data Culture via their Data Culture Rubric. We’ve been working alongside them with some of our Dalgo NGOs
Agency Fund brings in their expertise from a Learning and Experimentation Perspective, building data systems for scale and quality
Project Tech4Dev contributes our technology expertise and deep understanding of NGO systems and processes
Deep Dive with a Data Catalyst NGO (Uninhibited)
We released an open application and got a lot of great responses. We kept the application as short as possible, had a few follow on conversations and finally chose 12 NGOs to make up the 1st Data Catalyst Cohort. Our current model of the program is:
Spend the first month learning more about the NGOs data systems via the Data Culture Quiz, some deep dive pre-work, followed by a 60-90 min deep dive call. We will then allocate 2 team members to each NGO to help them over the next 3 months
A 2 day in-person meeting (happening in Kochi, Oct 17-18) where we get into details, sharing data stories and journeys, some best practices, a lot of time addressing problems NGOs currently have and some time reflecting and figuring out the roadmap
3 months of offline work between the NGO and the 2-person team allocated to the NGO. We expect to spend 3-4 hours/week with each NGO during this period.
We wrap up this cohort with another in-person meet in the second week of January
All of the information on the program can be found on
our shared folder
. We’ll follow up with periodic blog posts as we make progress with the cohort. Abhishek Nair will have a follow on post about the application process and the pre-work we did before the quiz.
Big tip of the hat to Kavneet, Toshal and Nirali from Dasra for moving and dragging us along at a good clip, and to Priyank and Joanna from data.org for being so generous with their time and sharing the work they’ve doneTitle: Data Catalyst Program: Our Journey from Data Chaos to Data Clarity with Dataform

Bringing back the Dataform from the Desert
By Chello Yana, Saajha
It is always overwhelming and scary to start something new. Beginning something is always confusing, filled with millions of thoughts, will it work or will not work. Where do we  begin and how do we proceed? Whom can I turn to when things are not working and you have doubts and questions.
I got to know about Dataform at the beginning of 2023 through Robert and worked on it just a little bit and Robert told me to reach out anytime when stuck. But got stuck. I did not reach out to Rob since I was not going to use Dataform anyways at that point as I was working on other priorities and I felt it would be just a waste of his time so parked Dataform somewhere in the Sahara desert
though I have never been to
.
Another reason I was not confident and courageous enough to work on it since I did not have a dedicated mentor, use case (problem) and time.
So mid of the year I heard about the Data Catalyst Program from Prashast and applied along with him.
So through the Data Catalyst Program module 1 we along with our POC team had identified the following problem statements.
In many instances, the team, partners, and management face challenges when it comes to making timely decisions. This can be attributed to three significant factors. Firstly, the data required for these decisions is frequently not automated, necessitating manual interventions. Consequently, valuable time is wasted in this process. Secondly, inconsistencies often arise across various datasets, leading to additional delays in processing and cleaning the data. Lastly, the understanding of the data at the backend is limited to only a select few individuals within the organisation. These factors collectively hinder the prompt decision-making process and highlight the need for improved automation, data consistency, and knowledge sharing within the organisation.
The back then of our situation involves the direct connection of our data visualisation tool to our data warehouse through queries. So only data engineers had the capability to build dashboards with SQL queries, as opposed to data analysts.
We faced several challenges in this setup. Firstly, the sheer number of queries made it difficult to manage and resulted in inconsistencies and duplicates. Additionally, the complexity of these queries often led to computation errors. Moreover, the lack of data partitions resulted in high computation costs. Furthermore, since our users were enrolled in multiple programs, consolidating data across multiple platforms became a challenge. Lastly, we are scaling our programs next year so it will be difficult, as costs will increase linearly as programs grow.
And through our follow-up few POC meetings post DCP module 1 helped us what we needed to work on for the problems we identified.
To address these challenges, we implemented Dataform as our solution with guidance. Dataform allows us to understand how data gets transformed, improving data literacy across our organisation. It also automates the updating of data and running of pipelines, streamlining our processes.
You can find more details about data form
here
.
Back to the start of this blog: Starting was overwhelming. But the POC team helped me start Dataform from the beginning and I did follow their lead. But unlike the first paragraph where I mentioned I got stuck so I parked the Dataform somewhere in the desert.
But this time I was confident to work on it because I knew dedicated mentors (DCP POCs) will be there for problems and also time.
POCs encouraged me everytime I told them I was overwhelmed and confused. Guided me to take one step at a time and their encouragement helped me to explore more.
We did work on it and our progress was presented during Goa DCP module 2. Rest are now the use cases we worked on using Datatorm.
Firstly, making a pipeline for the program we were running.
Figure 1.1
is a snapshot of our earlier pipeline where we have our source data and followed by large and complicated queries with which the dashboard builds on looker studio. So Grey box is a mysterious box. It is hard for any team member to know clearly what’s going on with the query and if a bug comes it will be hard to debug and if changes need to be made it gets messy.
Fig 1.1
But in
Figure 1.2
The mysterious Grey box is broken into different stages and different chunks of queries. You get clarity from where data is coming from and what data is available. Final raw data is prepared and final calculations of metrics are stored in another production table from where the dashboard is connected. This helped in fixing the compute engine limitation error that occurred while running large and complex queries in looker studio directly and queries and data pipeline became more manageable. Easy to make changes or updates.
Fig 1.2
The second use case we worked on was optimising the computation memory usage by orchestration of the pipeline.
Below Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 are simple queries, both query returns the same list of phone numbers to whom we have sent a type of message called template, but Figure 2.1 is data being queried from the original data table called message which has all kinds of messages . And memory used will be
633.26
MB.
Fig 2.1
Figure 2.2 returns same list of phone numbers but from new table built using dataform which has only information related to template message sent unlike message table which has lots other types message’s data and it takes just
50.43
MB of memory which is approximately 13 times lesser than Figure 2.1.a query
Fig 2.2
In conclusion, dedicated mentors and time and team members aligned on the same page helps us go forward.
Thanks to the Data Catalyst Program through it I was able to work on Dataform, otherwise Dataform would have been under the sand completely in the Desert. And also enjoyed a mesmerising sunset at the Beach thanks to DCP.Title: Data Catalyst Program: Shaping Data Leadership in Nonprofits

==================================================

This blog is written by
Kavneet Kaur
, Associate Director, Dasra
What started as a vision has begun to take the shape of reality! The
Data Catalyst Program (DCP)
, born from a collaboration between
Project Tech4Dev
and
Dasra
, set out to amplify the impact of data-driven decision-making in the nonprofit sector. Anchored by Dasra’s expertise in cohort-based engagements and Tech4Dev’s deep understanding of data and technology for social impact, the program embarked on its journey with a pilot in 2023. The road was experimental, filled with collaboration across teams and deep support from
Goalkeep
, our trusted knowledge partner.
Fast forward to today, DCP has engaged with
22 nonprofit organizations
and
45 data implementors
—each acting as a Data Catalyst in their respective organizations. As the final module of our second cohort concluded this past Friday, it feels like the perfect time to reflect on our learnings and progress.
Data Leadership: The Heart of the Journey
A central question guiding our program has been:
Who are data leaders?
Through the DCP, we have worked to help participants discover their potential as data catalysts—individuals who champion the use of data to drive organizational change. Here are some reflections:
Building Ownership at Every Level:
One of the strongest realizations from this journey has been the importance of cultivating an ownership mindset across all levels of an organization. Data leadership is not confined to the senior-most leaders; rather, it thrives when every individual sees themselves as a steward of their organization’s data journey. Personal accountability and active participation are critical to this transformation.
Empowering Data Catalysts:
The program has highlighted the need to build both technical expertise and strategic knowledge among participants. Equipping data implementers with tools and frameworks not only helps them solve immediate data challenges but also positions them as data leaders who can inspire and sustain a culture of data-driven decision-making.
The Evolution of Leadership:
Data leadership is as much about mindset as it is about skillset. From understanding the value of transparent data sharing to navigating the ethical implications of data and technology, leaders must balance technical proficiency with the ability to guide teams through cultural shifts.
The Program in Action
Our workshops and mentoring sessions have been designed to reflect this ethos. Across the program, participants engaged in sessions on:
AI for Insights:
These sessions focused on exploring how organizations can leverage AI tools to generate meaningful insights. Participants worked with large language models (LLMs) to understand patterns in data, reduce manual effort, and streamline decision-making. Jerome from Tech4dev made the sessions so interesting and easy to follow. A major takeaway personally for me was how these tools can make data analysis accessible even for teams with limited technical expertise.
Data Dashboards:
Participants were introduced to the art and science of building action-focused dashboards. For example, they learned how to organize data tables and implement best practices for designing dashboards that are both intuitive and impactful. Team Goalkeep did a fabulous job in ensuring these sessions were effective, engaging and fun!
Automating Data Pipelines:
The focus here was on building automated data pipelines that ensure accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. This session helped participants understand how automation can eliminate redundancies and free up resources for higher-value tasks. Tech4Dev and Goalkeep delved into this topic leaving participants with the curiosity to learn more.
Unlocking Data Access:
One of the most engaging discussions for both cohorts led by Tech4dev team revolved around the policies and practices needed to manage data access responsibly. Participants explored how transparency and security can coexist, ensuring data is shared ethically within and beyond their organizations.
Pitching Progress: A Proud Moment
This year the program culminated with a vibrant
pitch session
, where each participating organization showcased their data-driven initiatives and how they’ve begun transforming their data practices. From crafting impactful dashboards, using AI effectively, leading research impact projects to proposing new whtsapp chatbots for effective data collection and consolidation, participants demonstrated incredible progress and upcoming plans. Based on live ratings from peers and mentors, Fortify Health was declared the winner of a INR 5lacs grant to action their plans.  It was a moment of pride to see how far each organization had come in their journey toward leveraging data for impact.
NGO pitches demonstrating data initiatives and innovative ideas
“ Before joining the DCP, working with data felt like staring into a dark void. The ambiguity and our lack of technical expertise made it intimidating, often leading to isolated, intuitive decisions made on an ad-hoc basis—or worse, data being overlooked entirely. Through this program, my team and I overcame that fear, thanks to the mentorship and support we received, which helped us build the confidence to make data-driven decisions.” – Rukimini Bhatia (Head of Curriculum and People at Saturday Art Class)
Secret Ingredient
A standout feature of the Data Catalyst Program has been its
mentorship component
, which brought together seasoned experts from Tech4Dev and Goalkeep to provide participants with personalized guidance. These mentors served as sounding boards, problem solvers, and strategic advisors, helping each organization navigate its unique data challenges. Unlike many volunteer based mentorship, this is more structured and has rigor to commit ~40hrs of mentorship support to an organization. The scope of work is co-decided by the mentor and mentee and with regular check-ins and catch ups it is ensured there is progress and learnings. Whether it was dashboard reviews and re-designs, enabling historical data analysis, guiding data strategy or reviewing data flows – the 1:1 mentorship sessions enabled participants to translate learning into actionable plans. This close-knit support system not only accelerated individual growth but also fostered a sense of collective accountability, making mentorship the cornerstone of the program’s success.
Looking Ahead
As we reflect on the past two years of DCP, it is clear that the path to becoming a data-driven organization is a continuous one. The seeds of change have been planted, and it is up to each Data Catalyst and organization to now stay focused and move ahead on this path.
We remain optimistic about the road ahead—one where data leadership becomes the norm, driving scalable and sustainable impact.
“The data leadership session has made it clear to me that I aspire to be a data leader and am eager to pursue that growth.” – Akshata Hawaldar (Assistant Manager, Product Development at Antarang Foundation)Title: Data Collection & Reporting for GiveIndia.org

==================================================

As a part of the Tech4Dev initiative, we (Think201) are working along with GiveIndia.org to build a seamless Data Collection & Reporting application.
Introduction
GiveIndia is India’s largest and most trustworthy online donation platform.
They currently support 600 nonprofits in their fundraising efforts. Over the next 12 months, this number will expand to over 1500 nonprofits and to 5000 over the next 3 years.
As a platform, GiveIndia believes in keeping extremely high standards for donor trust. Every organization that they partner with goes through a robust due-diligence process and all programs listed on the platform provide regular reports to donors, with some going to the extent of providing details of the individual beneficiaries.
Challenge to be Solved
In line with their mission of keeping high standards for donor trust, GiveIndia team wants to level up the benchmark of updates about program and beneficiary details that goes to the donors. The quality upgrade is not just about the final outcome which goes to the donor, but also in the process that is followed to collect, review & representation of the data. Challenge is to also get the NGO users to promptly submit the updates w.r.t program as well as beneficiary details diligently in a stipulated period of time without much of any manual intervention.
Current Process Followed
The current process that is in place is a very laborious and error-prone process.
There are instances of lag time in reporting a change in beneficiary data thereby impacting communications to the donor.
Reports which include program update data, as well as beneficiary update data, are very minimal & not of good quality.
Data that is getting collected are done via spreadsheets & hence collecting and organizing images that are relevant to content is a horrendous task. This has also affected the data collection part itself.
Reviewing and sending back reports which are of not great quality is also done via spreadsheets which leaves room for misses on timely followups.
How we intend to solve
By evaluating the challenges as well as the user persona, here is how we propose to solve this working along with the team GiveIndia.
We understand that technology infusion will solve the challenge by empowering the identified roles with modules that would help them achieve the intent at ease.
We would be building a web application and mobile application that helps to solve the challenge. Logically we have identified the following roles doing actions as described below
Role Super Admin (Web)
For a super admin, we will be building modules which would help them to
NGO Details –
View NGOs and the programs that are active currently. Each NGO?s program detail will have detailed information about relationship manager mapped, current beneficiaries, reports submitted so far all arranged logically.
Program Update & Report Data Management –
Will be able to view program updates and reports submitted which would have relevant status mentioned alongside such as approved/rejected/awaiting review.
Here is where template creation for category of NGOs will be possible for data collection.
Beneficiary Management –
Super admin can also add/edit/remove a new beneficiary. Any such actions will update beneficiary data in the parent database and the NGO under context will receive email notification about the changes made. This would also impact donor reallocation logic & communication to donors which are handled at the parent database.
Notification Module –
A module that would let super admin write a custom email along with custom filters to choose recipients. This module helps in generating custom alerts to applicable NGOs on various conditions. An example of a custom filter would be:  Choose NGOs which have no Program Update last month.
Such relevant logic will be developed as custom filters to achieve the bigger intent of building this product.
Role Relationship Manager (Web)
For relationship manager, we will be building modules which would help them to
Review Beneficiary Submissions –
Will be able to view new submissions/ change/ removal requests to beneficiary data which will be updated to parent database after review. This would also impact donor reallocation logic & communication to donors which are handled at the parent database
Review Report Submissions –
Will be able to view report submissions for each beneficiary under a program/ The data submitted will be reviewed for content correctness/clarity and quality. It would also let them edit and approve/reject data which would then get updated to the parent database.
Role NGO Admin ( Web & PWA )
For an NGO admin, we will be building modules which would help them to do
User Management
– Letting them add, activate and deactivate users who would manage the NGO account in terms of data collection and reporting.
Beneficiary Management
– Letting them enroll/edit/remove new beneficiaries to program using a template that can unique to each program which will be sent for approval before adding them to the program.
Report Submission –
Allowing them to submit a report about the program and beneficiary in a timely manner. The report template will be unique to each category of NGO?s program to make data collection easy and presentable. This module will allow them to collect data and submit for review.
Report submission would include capturing media-rich content about the beneficiary which may include text/image/file/video byte along with content. The module lets the user to do so using both mobile and web interface
Role NGO User (Web & PWA)
For an NGO User, we will be building modules which would help them to
Program Details
– View program they are mapped to, details and relevant information about its beneficiaries currently enrolled and their profiles.
Beneficiary Management
– Letting them enroll/edit/remove new beneficiaries to program using a template that can unique to each program which will be sent for approval before adding them to the program.
Report Submission –
Allowing them to submit a report about the program and beneficiary in a timely manner. The report template will be unique to each category of NGO?s program to make data collection easy and presentable. This module will allow them to collect data and submit for review.
View Communication Updates –
Allows them to view communication updates as notifications which are triggered by super admin/ relationship manager about report data/new timelines/ rejection of report data
How this product will fit into the existing platform of GiveIndia.org
We would be developing this product which would work closely with existing applications. The core data such as NGOs currently active, programs that are active under NGO along with beneficiary data are present in the parent database and we will never clone the data to the database of the system we build. The Data Collection & Reporting will have its own database which would collect data and then writes data back to the parent database thereby maintaining sanitized data w.r.t beneficiary data which is very crucial.
Next steps
With an understanding of what is the overall intent of the application to be built, we have come up with a plan of taking a design-first approach for the overall execution of the project.
Our aim is not just to build functional features but also to build great UI & UX so that NGO admin and NGO users who are on the field will be able to do the job easily. Design-driven technology infusion will definitely help us achieve the goal.Title: Data Engineering for Good – Initial thoughts on the data platform

==================================================

This post was written by Robert On from
The Agency Fund.
This is part of an
ongoing series of posts
as we think, design and build an open source data platform. You can read more about the history of this project in our
introductory blog post
.
Background
There are many potential applications of data science methods for the purposes of advancing social good and its outcomes that range from descriptive statistics and visualizations, to predictive analytics enabled by machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as generating causal evidence leveraging experimental methods or reinforcement learning.
However, many examples in applying these methods continue to be exactly that, one-time examples. Enabling this analytical capacity for an organization requires a certain level of internal infrastructure to make its application practical and effective. Enter Data Engineering.
Data Engineering is a field that allows the data generated by an organization’s information systems to be usable for analysis. These analytical use cases can be fed back into the operations of the organization, leveraged to develop or improve new or existing products and services, shared with a broader research community or used to satisfy stakeholder reporting requirements. Before tackling any of these use cases with any of the earlier mentioned methods, the data needs to be made easy to work with. Following learning from the technology sector, we lay out a basic Development Data Stack (DDS) below:
The Development Data Stack
There are three primary components to a data stack, commonly abbreviated as ETL: Extract, Transform, Load. These three phases, explained below, describe the core operations of a data engineering workflow, while they are often described in this specific order, modifications of the order and repetition of the stages also emerge in practice.
Context Free
We would like this phase of the ETL to be context independent, meaning that these are general data transformations that we would do for all sources of data and independent of context specific knowledge about the organization’s operations.
Extraction
Data first needs to be extracted from existing information systems to be processed by later stages in the data pipeline. The job of extraction is meant to accomplish the following:
Extract data from the original systems that generate them. The mechanisms available are typically one of the following:
Connecting to an existing database
Pulling data from an API
Scraping data from the web
Copying the data to a “Data Lake”, a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data. It is important is this step to ensure that the data is completely unprocessed and comes as-is directly from the source systems. This could happen in batch, at scheduled intervals, or streamed in real time. If this data stores state that can be overwritten, it may be important to timestamp the extractions for updates to the same data across time.
Catalog metadata about each of the sources (basic description, when last updated, how frequently updated, size, format, etc)
Transformation (Context-free)
The first level of transformation consists of a set of operations that are executed on the data that is largely independent of the specific context in which it operates. This includes the following:
Cleaning / Typing: Cleaning obviously erroneous data such as inconsistent or invalid date formats, ensuring consistency of missing values, fixing obvious typos, and casting fields to their appropriate data type.
Joining / Unnesting / Flattening: Joining different data sets based on a predefined schema, unnesting hierarchical data, and reshaping the data into an accessible tabular format.
Cataloging: Organizing the data in a structure that is intuitive to access (by source, date, etc).
Loading to a Data Warehouse
We make this tabular data structure available in a quick-to-query data warehouse. PostgreSQL may be able to handle small to medium use cases while columnar formats such as parquet would be better geared to handle data with a very large (100+) number of columns. BigQuery might be a good option for higher volumes of data.
Context-dependent
The phases below map to specific data requirements of the organization. This means mapping the fields of data into program-meaningful measures of its onboarding, program take up and implementation, and proximal and long-term outcomes of its beneficiaries.
Data Workbench
Exploring data
Create some basic tools to help analysts at the organization make sense of the data in the data warehouse. The querying is presumably fast (real-time) and relatively easy (no nested structures, etc) such that they can develop a set of queries or expressions to construct organization context-specific fields and KPIs. This set of work helps document the construction of these metrics and lead to automation in generating them over time.
Analytical work
This same workbench can be leveraged to do advanced visualization or analysis on the data. This could mean:
Building predictive models via Machine Learning to forecast future items that require action
Executing and evaluating experiments run within the program.
Building new products or features based on these models/analyses.
Optimizing resource allocations based on available data (routes, inventory, allocation of staff, etc)
Transform – Mapping/Construction KPIs
Take insights from the metric mapping and construction and feed them into an ongoing data pipeline that produces these metrics automatically, on a regular basis. We would like limited aggregation to happen here to maintain flexibility for future use.
Loading back to the organization
Feed data back into systems that drive organizational change or adaptation. This means sending the data to be used in:
A visualization tool (Microsoft BI, Apache Superset, Metabase, Data Studio, etc) for other staff and stakeholders in the organization to view and respond to.
Directly back into the technology used to interface with beneficiaries.
Reports and data for research with external stakeholders (researchers, donors, etc)Title: Data Maturity Assessment, review from using the tool

Summary
As the first step in Dasra and Project Tech4dev’s Data Catalyst Program, we used
data.org
’s Data Maturity Assessment to initiate the journey of data culture. This blog captures the reflections from doing the assessment as a mentor with
Center for Mental Health, Law and Policy (CMHLP)
. This helped to benchmark the data practices, uncover hidden gaps. align the team on what it truly means to become a data-led organization in the mental health space. This quick, structured tool not only highlighted practical issues like data security and uneven practices across programs but also sparked deeper conversations around frameworks and shared language—setting the stage for a sustainable, actionable data culture journey.
What is Data Maturity Assessment
data.org launched the Data Maturity Assessment (DMA) to enable better benchmarking of the social impact sector, help organizations prioritize which areas of data maturity need investment, and enable self-service connections to tools and resources that help with the transformation needed to become a “Data Led” organization. The tool was built from extensive research and in consultation with social impact organizations tackling these topics. The assessment takes about 12 minutes to complete and delivers a clear results summary.
The results are presented as a rating on a scale of 1-10, broken down as “Overall Score” and 3 separate scores for “Purpose”, “Practice” and “People” aspects. Each of these aspects are further broken down into various categories to inspire discussion and inform action.

The leadership team was able to identify the variability in the perception of data security policy between team members operating in different programs. While one team member rated 10/10, another team member rated 2.5.
This enabled the conversation as to why there was a divergence in this perception, leading to the insight that the initiative in the research phase has clear guidelines and policies for data security, while this clarity is lacking in the initiatives ongoing in the scaled implementation phase.
Data is used well, but practices need more standardization
Team members reflected that data for decision-making is used well.  As seen from high ratings given by all team members for “Application”, “Strategy” and “Responsible Use” aspects.
The team however also reflected that there are uneven processes between different programs. As well as the time being spent towards repetitive analysis tasks done manually leading to time sink and course corrective action being delayed.
Language and framework alignment emerged
The team was also able to reflect that spending time talking about terms such as data infrastructure, security, quality, purpose and culture. Understanding the perspectives of each team member helped to arrive at common definitions and frameworks.
Why this was a great activity to do:
The tool sparked productive reflection
Using the DMA tool created a safe structure for the team to reflect individually as they rated the various aspects. Congregating post the ratings and in a facilitated discussion format enabled folks their real concerns and excitement, making in-articulated barriers a bit more visible.
It set the stage for an actionable data culture journey
Rather than viewing data maturity as a static “score,” the tool is helping CMHLP view it as an ongoing, layered process tied to program quality and impact.

==================================================

In this
follow-up
blog post, I continue to delve into my ongoing work with
Quest Alliance
on the data testing framework. Building upon my previous discussion about the definition of a testing framework and its initiation for Quest Alliance, this post provides insights gained during the second month of implementation.
To provide context, our project involved a datasource created using a Talend pipeline, and our goal was to replicate this pipeline to produce the same desired output in Google Sheets. The initial step involved identifying all data sources used in constructing the pipeline and its final output, which comprised three pipelines:
Pipeline one, utilizing 10 source tables
Pipeline two, incorporating 5 source tables
Pipeline three, a query that combined pipeline one and two with specific filters and cleanups
Once the pipelines were outlined, the next step was to gain an overview and document them. Joseph from the QA team played a crucial role in providing this overview, making the process relatively straightforward.
The subsequent task was to determine the timeframe for data extraction. Given the limitations of Google Sheets in handling a large number of rows, we opted for a sample timeframe based on the largest table’s row count, restricting it to around 10,000 rows.
Following this, we extracted data from all source tables for the specified timeframe, paving the way for the next stage – performing joins in Google Sheets. Notably, Google Sheets’ functions such as VLOOKUP, QUERY, and MINIFS played a pivotal role in streamlining the pipeline replication process.
As we delved deeper into the data, the role of a data analyst became more apparent. Questions arose, offering insights into why certain data was required and prompting considerations for alternative approaches. This reflective process is essential for ensuring the efficiency and relevance of the pipeline.
Finally, we are approaching the critical stage of comparing the calculated data in the sheets against the original data post-pipeline execution. This step is crucial in identifying any discrepancies and building trust in the accuracy of the data.
In summary, the reconstruction of the pipeline highlighted several key realizations:
New Perspectives: For individuals new to the organization, the process offers detailed insights into the program’s intricacies and the reasons behind data collection. This fresh perspective can lead to more efficient pipeline reconstruction.
Continuous Improvement: A reevaluation of the entire process, facilitated by a different set of eyes, provides a valuable perspective on whether things are aligned with requirements or if adjustments are needed.
Trust in Data: Ultimately, rebuilding the pipeline contributes to a heightened level of trust in the accuracy and reliability of the collected data.
Through these experiences, the data testing framework not only serves its primary purpose but also acts as a catalyst for organizational learning and improvement.Title: Data Transformation Journey: LAHIs Collaboration with Dalgo

==================================================

Out of everything that it was,
Arghyam
holds a special place in my professional journey as it was the very first project I worked on after joining
Project Tech4Dev
. Starting at a new place always comes with its own mix of emotions—excitement, nervousness, curiosity, and a strong drive to prove oneself. Arghyam provided the perfect platform for me to channel these emotions into something productive. The project wasn’t just a task to complete but an opportunity to immerse myself in tools, workflows, and concepts that I had only read about before. If you were to ask me what my favorite thing about this project was, I’d say without hesitation:
the immense learning curve it offered
.
Working on Arghyam was an intensive learning experience in data engineering, analytics, and visualization. I had the opportunity to deeply explore and apply tools like dbt (Data Build Tool), Apache Superset, and
the Dalgo platform
, while also enhancing my SQL proficiency significantly. Beyond the technical aspects, I gained a nuanced understanding of the social sector’s operational dynamics, focusing on workflows that directly benefit individuals in need.
Anurakshaks and Their Role
In Arghyam’s case, this was particularly reflected in the support provided to
Anurakshaks
, the field operators responsible for managing the financial aspects of water connections within their designated areas. Their responsibilities include tracking consumer details, billing records, and payment histories for these connections. Additionally, the system equips
Anurakshaks
to oversee operational and maintenance expenses related to
piped water supply systems
, as well as tank cleaning, ensuring sustainability and efficiency.
Beyond financial management, Anurakshaks also monitor community engagement activities, such as the number of
Jal Chaupal meetings (community gatherings to address water supply issues)
and
Ward Implementation and Management Committee (WIMC)
meetings. They assess and report on the participation rates in these gatherings, fostering greater community involvement in water management initiatives.
Digging into my contribution to the project
Taking a
breadth-first approach
to explain my contributions to the project, I’ll first outline the comprehensive insights provided by the Superset dashboard for Arghyam. These include:
Water Availability Analytics
: Tracking the number of days with water availability and unavailability in each village.
Water Quality Monitoring
: Analyzing the frequency of water quality testing and the outcomes of those tests.
Tank Maintenance
: Recording the number of instances tank cleaning operations were performed.
Community Engagement Metrics
:
Frequency of Jal Chaupal (community discussions on water issues) and Ward Implementation and Management Committee (WIMC) meetings.
Participation metrics segmented by male and female attendees in these meetings.
Financial Analytics
:
Monthly demand generation and payment collection trends for water connections.
Monthly expenditure tracking for villages on water supply systems.
Monitoring advance payments and arrears at both monthly and cumulative levels.
Performance Index
: An aggregate index evaluating the overall performance across all the above parameters to provide a holistic view of water management efficiency and community engagement.
My work began with designing and building
dbt models
to create tables containing direct, pre-processed data for all the parameters mentioned above. These tables were designed to serve as the foundation for creating specific visualizations in Superset.
The dbt models involved creating transformations by joining multiple columns across various source tables while applying specific conditions to ensure data accuracy and relevance.
The
Demand Collection
dbt model is designed to aggregate and consolidate payment and demand data for water connections. Key features include:
Overview of dbt Models and Their Integration with Superset
1. Demand Collection Model
Data Integration
:
Combines data from source tables: payment details and demand details.
Utilizes a
full outer join
on consumercode and tenantid to ensure complete data coverage across records.
Tenant Identification
:
Uses tenantid as a unique identifier, generated by concatenating district name, block name, gp name (Gram Panchayat), ward name, and ward code, ensuring accurate location-based data tracking.
Metadata Enrichment
:
Links additional fields, such as connection status and usernames, via
LEFT JOINs
with relevant tables.
Output
:
Produces a materialized table containing financial details (payments and dues) and metadata for analytics. The model is materialized as a table in a specific schema, ensuring persistent storage for downstream use.
The
Expenditure
dbt model focuses on tenant-level financial data aggregation. Key details include:
2. Expenditure Model
Data Integration
:
Combines data from the demand collection table (created via dbt) and the source tenant expenses table.
Merges records using a
full outer join
on tenantid and date.
Output
:
Generates a materialized table with aggregated totals for expenditures, amounts collected (paid), and tenant-associated usernames.
3. Performance Index Model
The
Performance Index
dbt model calculates a composite score to evaluate user-level water management performance. Features include:
Key Metrics
:
Water Availability
: % of days with water and availability scores.
Water Quality
: Recency of water quality testing.
Community Engagement
: Attendance at WIMC and Jal Chaupal meetings.
Financial Contributions
: Tariff collection against target dues.
Score Calculation
:
Computes a total_score by aggregating individual scores for each metric.
Output
:
Produces a materialized table with user-specific scores and detailed data on water days, testing, tank cleaning, and community meetings, etc.
For Integration with Superset for Visualization –
Direct Source Tables
:
For metrics or analytics that can be derived directly from source tables, these are used in Superset to reduce transformation overhead.
Aggrgated Tables
:
When specific and pre-processed data is needed for visualization (e.g., composite scores or financial summaries), dbt-created tables like demand_collection, expenditure, and performance_index are utilized.
Chart Types Used
:
Big Numbers
: Used when numerical answers or summary statistics were required, such as total payments, expenditures, or number of Jal Chaupal meetings.
Bar Charts
: Utilized to visualize distributions or comparisons, such as attendance in WIMC/jal chaupal meetings or tariff collection percentages.
Tables
: Used to display detailed data representations, providing granular insights such as monthly payments, demands, advances, expenditures, and water quality results, including parameters like pH, chloride, sodium, and more.
A view of the tab for “Payments and Demand” from the dashboard
Additional Enhancements for Improved Dashboards:
Localized Titles
: All dashboard titles, tabs, and chart labels were presented in Hindi to ensure accessibility and usability for Anurakshaks, many of whom are more comfortable with Hindi.
Time Range Filter
: A 6-month time range was applied to all charts, focusing on recent data and insights for more specific and relevant observations.
Challenges Faced
Data Inconsistencies
: Frequent confusion arose due to the way data was collected and updated, leading to discrepancies in the outputs. This required iterative refinements and the application of specific conditions to the dbt models and chart configurations to align with the desired results.
Data Gaps
: In some cases, significant portions of data were missing for certain usernames (linked to specific Anurakshaks), while others had an abundance of data. This created initial doubts about the correctness of the tables and required thorough investigation and adjustments to ensure data accuracy.
Problem-Solving
: Several other issues surfaced during the process, but with systematic approaches, debugging, and excellent guidance from supervisors, I was able to address and resolve them effectively.
To Conclude it all out
Overcoming these challenges not only improved the quality and accuracy of the dashboards but also enhanced my understanding of data engineering workflows. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability, attention to detail, and collaboration in solving complex problems, all of which were key to the successful completion of this project.

Welcome to dalgoTitle: Data is the new frontier – How do we go about deciding on a potential new platform?
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: August 2022

==================================================

Before we get to the gist of this blog post, some background is needed. So we’ll go back in time when we started Glific. We knew that analysis and visualization were an important element, and we wanted to provide it from the very beginning. However, we also were aware that we did not have the time or money to build this internally, and would need to reuse something out there. The open source world did not have too many option (still does not!) for user friendly visualization platforms. We decided to integrate with Google BigQuery and DataStudio and give NGOs an ability to visualize some common metrics and potentially extend it to their own specific needs.
A few months, maybe a a year goes by. Our stats indicated that only a third of our NGOs had actually enabled the visualization feature. This was a shocker (which I’m still recovering from), and also something we do need to address within Glific to make it even easier. So while we knew data and visualization is super important, we were getting requests for everything else but that.
Around the same time, we applied (and successfully received) a grant from
The Agency Fund
. They had some of their team in San Francisco, and from a thought partnership perspective it was a really good thing for me. It kinda gets lonely at times, working alone from home. They challenged us on a few things, but they kept pushing us to think more about data and A/B testing etc. In the back of my head I’m thinking: I can’t get our NGOs to look at their graphs out of the box, how will I even talk to them about A/B testing and similar things. This was probably the first step that got us thinking a wee bit more seriously about data.
Fast forward to March of this year, where we launched our Fractional CTO pilot with
Sneha Mumbai
and an amazing volunteer
Vinod Rajasekaran
(soon to be our newest Tech4Dev team member, yippee!). This pilot was
super useful to all of us
and I consider it a major success. In one of our monthly catchups, Vinod mentioned the “data pipeline” problems that we would need to solve for Sneha. Around the same time Swapneel and Manije from
GoalKeep
were educating us on
Building Data Culture within Non-Profits
. So to a large extent a lot of our worlds were colliding around the same time.
The above and other conversation, gave birth to the idea of:
Should we consider building a data platform that is easy for NGOs to use and onboard.
Vinod knew a wee bit about data tools and open source, I could throw out some jargon if needed, but since we knew folks in our network who knew a lot more about this and we strongly believe in collaboration, I decided to reach out to the vast Tech4Dev network to get an education in data engineering, data science and all things data. Luckily for us, Robert On from Agency Fund, and Eric and Ben from
IDInsight
were generous enough with their time and helped validate some of our thinking.
And this is the story of our latest experiment on:
Let’s give this a shot and see where we end up, maybe we can build a SaaS platform for NGOs.
As with all things we do, we need to do a few things before we actually go down the gnarly twisted road of platform building:
Doing a deep dive and crash course on data engineering and seeing what our options are
Recruiting a few stellar NGOs from our network who are facing this problem who could be our ideal pilot candidates.
Getting a software partner on board to help us from a resource and business perspective
Building a collaborative with other like minded partners and funders who also are interested in solving this issue. We’ve got a good start here with our friends from The Agency Fund, IDInsight and Goalkeep who are all super keen and interested.
So at this stage, you must be wondering on what exactly are we planning to do. Well, this blog post has gone a bit too long for me to give into it, but I’ll leave you with our
directory of documents
that you can peruse, and also an image of our thinking, courtesy of Robert.
Visual View of the data flows for a NGO
Robert went ahead and wrote a pretty detailed post on the way we are thinking of approaching the problem, especially with our pilot programs. You can read all the gory details in his blog post:

from
Caring with Colour
As a young organization, Caring With Colour (CWC) has been eager to take stock of the motivation levels of the teachers we work with, our impact on shifts in classroom practices, and the overall health of the several programs we lead in the three educational districts of Karnataka. Given this context, one of the key takeaways from our engagement with the Data Catalyst Program was the step-by-step approach to creating a robust and useful dashboard that would represent priority features of the initiatives and goals of our organization. One of the sessions during the second DCP workshop held in Bengaluru focused on dashboards, and as a novice ‘data leader’ (DCP cohort 2 will know what I’m talking about!), I think it is the slot I paid the most attention to.
Jishnu shepherded us from collecting data to envisioning dashboards – all in a matter of two hours. Starting with a recap of basic terminologies such as data ingestion, data transformation and data visualization, we moved on to discuss processes such as data staging, creating intermediate tables and destination tables. Although these seemed like heavy phrases at first, I was less intimidated after the hands-on activity helped us break these steps down. In pairs, we were guided through two mock scenarios on Excel to understand the usefulness of column categories ‘cardinality’, ‘dimensions’, and ‘numeric’. I was immediately able to imagine what these column categories would include in the CWC context – the UDISE (Unified District Information System for Education) code, teacher attendance in training programs, student assessment scores, etc. Next, we were asked to enter some mock data within the columns to test what the visualization would look like, and whether these could translate to metrics or indicators on our model dashboard. Again, I considered what our collaborators – teachers, government departments, or internal teams at CWC –  would want to know.
These steps may look obvious to those of us well versed in the language of data analytics. But for someone like me whose most recent engagement with data was undergraduate courses back in 2016, Jishnu’s slot with us made me feel so much more confident in discussing numbers with colleagues at CWC. Shout out to Jishnu and his team for covering so much in such little time!Title: Data-Driven Impact: How TAP Scales Education Through Technology and Insights

==================================================

This blog is written by Vinay Poulose, Manager, Monitoring and Evaluation, The Apprentice Project
At The Apprentice Project (TAP), our mission is to empower underserved children in India by helping them develop essential 21st-century skills. We accomplish this through our AI and ML-driven WhatsApp chatbot, TAP Buddy, which delivers personalized learning experiences directly to students. Since our inception in 2016, we have expanded our reach to 13 states and union territories, impacting more than 34,000 students across 240 schools in 2023-24 alone. Our dedicated and growing team of over 70 works tirelessly to ensure that quality education reaches the children who need it most, in partnership with organizations like Sunbird Trust and Pardada Pardadi Educational Society as well as government schools in states like Punjab and Maharashtra.
TAP Buddy offers students a choice of courses in areas such as coding, science, financial literacy, visual arts, and performing arts, providing them with a foundation of skills needed to thrive in today’s world. The chatbot not only delivers content but also collects data throughout the learning process. This data is critical to continuously improving student engagement and evaluating the success of our program.
However, unlike traditional education models, TAP operates with minimal direct contact with students and thus, relies more on the chatbot driven interactions for feedback. As a technology-driven initiative, our ability to analyze and interpret vast amounts of data is essential to ensuring that students are benefiting from the program. Given the scale at which we operate, this data presents both an opportunity and a challenge. With tens of thousands of students engaging with TAP Buddy across the country, the volume of data generated is immense. Analyzing this data and distilling actionable insights becomes crucial for refining the program and delivering an impactful learning experience.
Before adopting Dalgo as our data management solution, we struggled with manual processes that made it difficult to keep up with real-time data. Our data was collected through a CRM tool built on Frappe, with interactions tracked via Glific. All this information was consolidated in Google Sheets, where metrics were manually calculated, and visualizations were largely created in-house. While we occasionally used Looker Studio, accessing up-to-date data was always a challenge, and the entire process was time-consuming and prone to errors.
Dalgo offered us a way to transform how we handle data. We needed to eliminate manual data cleanups, enable real-time data access with minimal human intervention, and consolidate all our data visualizations into a single, easy-to-access dashboard. Dalgo has more than delivered on these requirements. It now consolidates and transforms all our incoming data, feeding it into Looker Studio, where comprehensive reports are created. The automation that Dalgo provides ensures our data is always up-to-date, saving the team significant time and effort that can be redirected towards improving student outcomes.
Looking ahead, we plan to build upon our data capabilities by incorporating additional key performance indicators (KPIs) into our dashboard. This will offer even deeper insights into how our program is performing across different regions and student demographics. Moreover, we aim to make data analysis more accessible to our non-technical teams, enabling them to transform and analyze data without needing SQL expertise. Analyzing qualitative feedback from students will also be a major focus, as it will provide invaluable insights for improving the learning experience TAP Buddy offers.
With Dalgo powering our data operations and TAP Buddy driving personalized learning, TAP is well-equipped to continue scaling its impact across India. As we grow, data will remain at the heart of our strategy, helping us refine our approach and ensure we are effectively empowering the next generation of leaders. By leveraging technology and insights, we’re not only reaching more students but also ensuring that each interaction contributes to meaningful, long-term change.Title: Day 2 Reflections: A Deeper Dive into AI and Data-Driven Social Impact

==================================================

By: Dawit Taddele Dessie
Today, We delved deeper into the world of AI and its potential for the social sector. The Data Catalyst Program continues to impress me with its thought-provoking discussions and inspiring speakers.
One of the key takeaways from yesterday’s session resonated strongly with me: effective data organization is as crucial as the collection itself. It’s a simple concept, but often overlooked. Technology can be a powerful tool for making data clear and actionable, but it’s only as good as the data it’s working with. Ensuring that data is representative and unbiased is essential for drawing accurate and meaningful conclusions.
As we explored real-world examples of AI applications, I was struck by the diversity of ways organizations are leveraging this technology. From streamlining daily tasks to driving organizational goals, AI is proving to be a versatile tool for social impact.
The session was filled with lots of great and useful information, providing us with valuable resources like the “Mapping the Landscape of AI-Powered Nonprofits” report and the “Introducing OpenAI for Nonprofits” program. These resources will undoubtedly be helpful as we continue to explore ways to apply AI to our own work.
The panel discussion on “Building a Data-Led Organization” was particularly inspiring. The leaders shared their experiences and insights on the importance of technology and data in fostering trust, citizen engagement, and effective impact measurement. I was particularly struck by their humility in admitting the challenges of becoming a data-driven organization. They emphasized that data is not inherently positive or negative, but rather a guiding map for decision-making. By aligning data with intended outcomes, organizations can course-correct and refine their strategies.
One of the most valuable lessons I learned from the panel was the importance of data literacy. As organizations strive to become data-driven, it’s essential that their employees have the skills and knowledge to understand, interpret, and utilize data effectively. This includes everything from data collection and cleaning to data analysis and visualization. By investing in data literacy training, organizations can ensure that their teams are equipped to make informed decisions based on evidence.
Another key consideration is the ethical implications of using AI in the social sector. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it’s important to be mindful of potential biases and unintended consequences. Organizations must take steps to ensure that AI systems are developed and used responsibly and ethically.
Overall, I am excited about the potential of AI to transform the social sector. By applying AI to the specific needs of organizations, we can unlock new possibilities for creating positive social impact.
The possibilities for our sector  are truly boundless when we marry data and AI. Imagine the potential of AI-powered tools to:
Identify and address systemic inequalities: By analyzing vast datasets, AI can uncover hidden biases and disparities that would be difficult to detect through traditional methods. This knowledge can inform targeted solutions and policies to create a more equitable society.
Optimize resource allocation: AI can help organizations allocate resources more efficiently by identifying areas of greatest need and predicting future trends based on data input. This can lead to more effective and impactful programs.
I am looking forward to continuing to explore how AI and data can be leveraged to enhance decision-making.Title: Demystifying Data for Nonprofits: The Dalgo Story with Abhishek Nair
Author: Deepak Nanda
Date: May 2025
Category: AI
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/demystifying-data-for-nonprofits-the-dalgo-story-with-abhishek-nair/
==================================================

In a detailed conversation, Abhishek Nair, sits down with Deepak Nanda to unpack the Dalgo’s origins, evolution, and growing impact across India’s nonprofit ecosystem.
What Is Dalgo?
Dalgo is a data platform built specifically for nonprofits. Its core purpose is to automate data flows, making it easier for organizations to generate insights and spend less time on repetitive data management tasks.
“Dalgo helps nonprofits automate the flow of data so they can spend more time learning from that data — and less time managing it.”
Why Dalgo: From a Challenge to a Platform
The idea for Dalgo emerged from Project Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO (fCxO) program. As fCxOs worked across nonprofits, a pattern emerged: NGOs used multiple tools — survey software, Google Sheets, chatbots — but data remained siloed and difficult to consolidate.
“NGOs were stringing together data in fragile ways or spending weeks every quarter just to get a complete picture. We wanted to fix that.”
This insight led to Dalgo’s mission: help nonprofits get a holistic, real-time view of their work and impact across tools, locations, and programs.
The Problem: Data Silos and Underused Insights
Two common realities shaped Dalgo’s design:
Data is mostly used for reporting to funders, not internal reflection or learning.
Teams are stretched thin — they collect a lot of data but often lack time or capacity to analyze or use it effectively and regularly.
Dalgo aims to bridge this gap: unify data from different sources, clean and structure it, and make it regularly accessible to all levels of a nonprofit — from field workers to leadership.
Case in Point: How SNEHA NGO Uses Dalgo
SNEHA, a health-focused nonprofit, is a great example of Dalgo in action.
Multiple Programs: They collect data from different programs using both survey tools and spreadsheets.
Automated Dashboards: Dalgo helped them unify data pipelines and create dashboards for field workers, M&E teams, and leadership.
Faster Access: Teams that once got monthly reports now access refreshed data daily.
Scalable Adoption: Started with one program, now expanding across three — and counting.
“Earlier the M&E team had to spend hours consolidating data. Now, field workers get insights daily and take action in real time.”
Making Data Simpler — for Everyone
One of Dalgo’s key goals is accessibility. Social sector teams often find data and tech tools overwhelming. Dalgo reduces this friction by:
Offering ready-to-use connectors to 300+ data sources.
Supporting both quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., text analysis using AI).
Giving NGOs the option to use their preferred visualization tools (like Google Data Studio or Superset).
Designing for non-engineers, including program and M&E teams.
“Our vision is to make data usable for everyone — not just M&E heads. We’re exploring how AI advancements might help with this too”
What’s Next for Dalgo
Dalgo is continuously evolving, with new directions focused on:
1. Chat With Your Data (AI-Driven Insight Generation)
Ask natural-language questions.
Get summaries, trends, and program insights instantly.
2. Storytelling with Data
Auto-generate quarterly reports for stakeholders.
Make dashboards more interactive and integrated into day-to-day conversations.
3. Impact Sector-Specific Design

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: May 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/design-process-explained-giveindia-org/
==================================================

So far, we (Think201) have understood the problem statement that we are solving for GiveIndia.org to a greater extent through various discussions, brainstorming sessions with all the stakeholders.
The understanding gained has been documented as Feature Requirement Specification (FRS) which can be found
here
. While FRS describes
what
has to be built as a product, its the design phase which defines
how
the product has to be built.
Like we mentioned earlier in our blog (linked
here
) we take a design-driven approach in building a product for the following reasons.
Forces to think about what end-user needs first through design & then develop the same.
Brings much clarity to feature-set which was discussed and documented thereby weeding out any/all assumptions.
Empowers to take feedback from stakeholders & end-users even before it is developed thereby saving a lot of time in case there needs a pivot.
For the very same right reasons, we have now entered the design phase for the GiveIndia project which involves the following steps to achieve the best results.
Step 1 – Thorough Understanding of Product
Process Followed
This phase is for understanding the product, its intent & the target users clearly. The majority of our focus would be in analyzing requirements, conducting brainstorming sessions with clients & getting clarity on doubts about the product to be designed. We would follow industry-standard user research methods to collect feedback & directions. In this phase, the Business Analyst & Design Team would work directly with clients and get requirements from them. This knowledge about the users and their environments helps in providing a clear direction to the design.
Activities
Meet, talk, observe and understand users in their environment
Analyze requirements to understand and clarify them
Define user personas and use-cases
Outcome
Clarity on the product that will be designed & the roles involved.
Creation of User Personas
Creating Flow Charts to understand the flow of data across roles

User Persona
Step 2 – Research & Documentation
Process Followed
In this step, the design team does the research work to explore on domain-specific, design trends, doing analysis.
Activities
Study of applicable design approaches for the problem statement
Analysis of latest UI/UX trends, design principles, and rules
Outcome
A clear understanding of, the design trend which would suit the product & idea captures. This step is mostly a design direction step & would be about gaining insights that would aid the deliverables in the next step.
Step 3 – StyleScape Creation
Process Followed
Stylescape is a vital step in the design process. It?s a visual representation of the stylistic direction for the project. It allows both you and the design team to view a quicker, deeper understanding than words alone can bring. This organized collage of images, colors, fonts, and phrases saves time in explanation and allows for easy initial feedback on what does and doesn?t work.
Stylescape brings about a meeting of the minds of clients, designers, and internal project collaborators. They are not about rendering something specific about the project, but about gathering consensus on direction.
Image – StyleScape
Step 4 – Prototyping
Process Followed
This stage involves the UI definition of the required feature. The design team drives this activity which is based on the last two stages of the process. Draw paper sketches, whiteboard flows, and wireframes to share your ideas with stakeholders. This stage itself is an iterative process.
Activities
Generate ideas and work on basic sketches
Brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to get their feedback from the technical perspective
Re-draw sketches and re-test them with stakeholders
Design Prototypes for all the Flows decided in

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: October 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates

==================================================

Exploring how Design Research can improve Access to Information & Civic-Engagement
A
Fiscal Data Explorer with Himachal Pradesh(HP)
as the focus state is being developed in collaboration between
CivicDataLab
and
Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability(CBGA)
supported by Tech4Dev. Part of the experimentation driven development process at CivicDataLab is doing research as a means to connect the pre, during and post phases of the project. When we start a project we ask ourselves – ?What do we already know about who we are developing this platform for and how can we build on this knowledge?? We use research as a means to learn about how this newly developed artefact sits across the different user groups we have developed it for (usability and feedback) and at the end of the project research acts as a bridge to support what has been achieved and what will continue to be possible moving in this direction (outcomes and speculations).
The Fiscal Data Explorer is one of its kind platform which aims to enable citizens to access budgets and spending data of their state government in an easy to comprehend and simple to use manner. This differs from the conventional approach of showing the state’s allocation and expenditure datasets on separate platforms making them look like separate concerns whereas they are essentially two sides of the same coin. For a project of this scale and vision, one can ask many questions (most of which can branch into their own research studies) right from what really is the fiscal literacy/curiosity in a given population to how well do certain kinds of data visualisations convey various kinds and levels of spending data that is made publicly available by the State.
Research Objectives
The
Open Budgets India(OBI)
platform was built in close partnership with CBGA and to a large extent reflects the concerns, ideas and possible solution pathways of the researchers at CBGA during its development. Given the limited possibilities of building on this we decided to test these assumptions and the platform in its current form with other organisations which work with public finance data and might have used the OBI platform at some point in the past year. The purpose of scoping the research this way was to meet the following objectives –
Touch base with the potential expert users of the OBI platform to see what they feel about the platform.
Understand how well the intentions of the team in building the platform translated into use by expert groups in terms of data discoverability and the actual features introduced on the platform.
Familiarise ourselves with the workflow of the expert user to uncover opportunities and problem areas in public finance data that we could leverage/address in the Fiscal Data Explorer.
Wherever possible discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with building the State-wide Fiscal Data Explorer.
Planning and Execution
Internal session on stakeholder mapping to understand various actors and their relationships
Towards meeting these objectives a roadmap was created which can be viewed
here
. We identified around 20+ stakeholders at various levels including the state government, state specific NGOs, national research organisations which work with public finance data and have looked at HP before, national news media which have covered the state budget in interesting ways and so on. We reached out to them and managed to interact with the following organisations and/or individuals –
Stakeholder Name

Accountability Initiative
Research
CBGA
Research
Gungharmal, Former Panch
Citizen, Shangarh – Kullu District
HowIndiaLives
Public Data Repository
Labsingh
Citizen, Bhuntar – Kullu District
LiveMint
News
NewsLaundry
News
With each stakeholder, we roughly followed the following format of interaction –
Introduction and demo of the OBI platform in its current state.
Discussion about the unique features of the Himachal Pradesh public finance data platforms and the motivation behind creating Fiscal Data Explorer.
Process Mapping of the stakeholder?s workflow related to Public Finance Data
Suggestions and feedback for Fiscal Data Explorer and other efforts under OBI
Workflow mapping of one of the partners interviewed for the study
Outcome and Learnings
On the synthesis of the interviews conducted with research organisations and media houses, we gained the following broad insights –
The platform needs to find more effective ways to become more communicative about the data available on it. This calls for providing more process-related information about how figures are being calculated, assisting researchers in making sense of technical terms on the go and building checks and balances that ensure that laypersons don?t misread the data/make erroneous conclusions based on limited knowledge.
Given that public finance data becomes more meaningful when understood at the sector level, the team should consider collaborating with sectoral experts to become a more reliable destination for answering sector-specific questions around budget data. This also calls for being transparent about the methods to arrive at these cohorts.
The platform suffers from poor adoption due to the inconsistent outreach and advocacy efforts around it. This calls for a multi-channelled and focused strategy to increase platform adoption and usage among different user groups.
The platform needs to start thinking seriously about how experts can leverage the data better for their purposes now that it has achieved the baseline goals of capturing and presenting the data. The insights about the workflow of expert users will help the team embed the platform use cases more deeply into the workflow of expert groups.
Given our goal of being open about our efforts, there is a need for the same to reflect in the documentation and roadmap of the platform development on the platform itself so that it becomes open to criticism, suggestions and contributions from the wider community that will benefit from its development.
Labsingh (M) shares his feedback about land use and farmer benefits in Kullu District
While the team was already familiar with several of the insights mentioned above, the in-person interaction along with the mapping exercise provided further evidence which will help us prioritise these concerns into concrete user stories. A preliminary analysis of the interviews with two citizens in Kullu district revealed some interesting insights which will further inform understanding of the platform design –
Citizens think and engage at very local scales – village, a cluster of families with similar interest (e.g. land holding, farming, crop insurance). Common concerns included primary and higher education, public healthcare and tourism.
Despite having faith and confidence in the policies proposed by the State government there is a considerable amount of scepticism around the government?s ability to implement these while factoring in the ground level realities so as to benefit those who really need it.
While it is good to have access to financial data, one citizen lamented that acting on it in some cases requires technical knowledge that they may not possess. For example, suspecting an anomaly in the Public Works Department’s spending how does one approach the department with evidence to back up the suspicion? Where will that evidence come from?
Most conclusions or perceptions related to the availability of public funds and its use were based on anecdotal data rather than actual numbers. There did not seem to be any motivation to look for the actual numbers behind it. Often citizens felt that this ?data? seems to be circulating among powerful stakeholders including government and this enabled corrupt practices.
The platform is best viewed on larger screens like laptops and desktop computers but most citizens are now more comfortable using mobile phones and own them in larger numbers compared to laptops or desktop computers.
Although we only managed to do two detailed interviews it did get us thinking about how different the data needs are for researchers and regular citizens. Given the considerable difference in the nature of the interviews and the outcomes we will need to rethink our strategy to engage and collect more citizen perspectives on the platform and its use. It also calls for more participatory design approaches which may involve co-designing interaction possibilities with citizens directly (Botero and Saad-Sulonen, 2008) and using scenario-based design tools and drama to collectively speculate future narratives of the platforms (Brandt and Grunnet, 2000 & Halse et. al 2010).
Heuristic Analysis of Himachal Pradesh?s existing platforms
Besides the synthesis of the interviews, we also did heuristic analysis (based on
Neilsen Norman group?s guidelines
for the same) of the
Himkosh
and
HP e-budget platforms
looking at the aspects which overlap with the use of Fiscal Data Explorer. This resulted in the identification of 8-9 violations in each tool which will be shared with the respective departments along with recommendations. The usability reports for District Disbursement Officer (DDO) Query, DDO Receipts Query and eBudget can be accessed
here
. Some of the major corrections are required in the following areas ?
1.     Visibility of System status
2.     Error Prevention and Recovery
3.     Help and Documentation
4.     Aesthetic and Minimal Design
While the tools were meant to have minimal options the current design is cluttered and is prone to errors while providing query values even by expert users.
Closing thoughts
While writing this blog, the last three items in the roadmap like generating user stories, feedback loops and dissemination strategies are still being worked on. With the experience of applying design research methods for this project, we are excited about exploring further opportunities to use design to uncover possible directions and improvements in our ongoing work in the public finance sector in collaboration with CBGA, Tech4Dev and other stakeholders.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: December 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/design-considerations-for-hasirudalas-dry-waste-collection-ims/
==================================================

Background
Dry Waste Collection Centres (DWCC) in Bengaluru are a recent-ish (since 2013-14) development in waste-management efforts of the city civic body BBMP in collaboration with various citizen groups and NGOs within the city. The idea for centres like these stemmed from a larger idea of containing and managing the waste generated in a ward within the ward itself.
There are about 166 functioning DWCCs (out of the sanctioned 198),
one per ward
, operating in a decentralized manner as they were envisioned. The management and operation of these DWCCs has been handed over to various contractors and agencies who operate them on BBMP’s behalf and perform necessary functions – like collecting this dry waste generated within their ward, segregating them into categories like high/low-value recyclables, reject, e-waste etc. and then depending on the nature of waste send it to aggregators (also setup by the BBMP to handle/store low value waste from multiple DWCCs) or recyclers or landfill.
Hasiru Dala
is one such organization which manages 33 DWCCs in Bangalore and couple more in adjacent regions. What sets Hasiru Dala apart from other agencies is that their DWCCs are operated by waste-pickers or waste-picker-entrepreneurs trained by Hasiru Dala? in line with their mission of bettering the lives of the waste-picker community who they serve. Hasiru Dala provides training, encouragement/support and operational help like dealing with necessary reporting, regulatory and financial paperwork required by BBMP. It is towards this purpose that they realized the need for software to keep track of these streams of incoming/outgoing waste in each DWCC, generate various reports required by BBMP or other collaborators (like UNDP) and also gain quantitative insights from this data.
Scope
I am pretty excited to be developing this solution given that the domain sits inside that of one of my pet interests – environment, and more importantly the opportunity to be working with an organization who is going at it in a wholesome manner and with admirably noble intentions (not just waste – waste-pickers matter too!). While the topic of waste management is a large one, in this post, I intend to only cover one cog in the process – DWCC – and the challenges involved in designing a software solution that works for the stakeholders involved.
Our mandate is to develop software that aids in the following functions:
Track streams of waste moving in and out of a DWCC
Track expenses involved in operating a DWCC
This post will only talk about the various constraints around which the solution needs to be designed specifically for pt.1 ? more concrete details like models and implementation will follow in subsequent posts.
An overview of the real-world process
Dry waste comes to a DWCC via:
Door-to-door household collection. A mini-trailer (usually a container mounted on top of a rickshaw-like vehicle) goes around gathering waste from houses in a ward and multiple of these vehicles are required to cover a whole ward.
Waste collected by sweepers
People dropping them off at these centres
This incoming waste is then segregated and kept in batches depending on the type of waste. Items could range from milk covers, shampoo bottles, emptied toothpaste containers, glass bottles, metal pieces, food packages etc.
A portion of it is considered “Reject”.
Once this segregation and batching is done, it is ready to be sold to recyclers or whoever is interested in buying them. This constitutes Outgoing waste. There is a marketplace for these items and now thanks to these processes becoming more formal and institutionalized, there is usually a standard rate as well.
Software design challenges
On paper, the process outlined above seems fairly straightforward. However, on the ground, things are slightly disorderly for various reasons ranging from the composition of incoming waste to availability of workers to various parties with vested interests who benefit from not having a smooth functioning system who we will not talk about here 😉
From a software design perspective, a well-oiled process that generates very specific, elemental data is always desirable. And things get complicated when these conditions don’t exist. Which is pretty much the case with tech in most social sector projects.
In our case, the complexity is in developing a software solution that works for 33+ DWCCs many of which operate in non-uniform ways.
At the time of writing, it is not practical to develop a solution to be used for real-time tracking of incoming/outgoing data directly from the DWCCs. Instead, data entry happens in a retrospective fashion. What they do presently is note down all required metrics on paper, hand it over to a coordinator who then brings it to a central office to feed it into the system. Incoming data is recorded daily, outgoing data as and when it happens (on a weekly basis approximately) and all this data gets fed into the system once or twice a month.
Retrospective data entry means it is not possible to have strong validations to prevent wrong data from going in and instead make do with a flag and review system.
The nature and quality of data noted down (which ultimately depends on the type of waste coming in) also poses an order of magnitude of complexity when it comes to doing analytics on the data. For example, segregated waste provides for the cleanest kind of data but often there is mixed waste in the incoming stream and these disproportionate combinations of waste are hard to make sense of. Another problematic area is stock keeping which is a problem space of its own.
Another thing that needs to be kept in mind is to provide for some flexible taxonomy system to be able to label waste in various ways. This is necessary because Hasiru Dala collaborates with different partners (UNDP, Sweepsmart etc.) in a subset of centres and with this feature, their waste-classification nomenclature gets included without much hassle.
While collaborating with Indha and Pradeep from Hasiru Dala, we were able to identify small/incremental changes that could be made in the process that could potentially provide for much higher gains from both a data reporting and ground operations perspective. These changes cannot be made overnight but we hope they will be able to overcome the real-world hurdles in bringing these plans to fruition.
For now, the plan is to capture whatever available data and make sense of it and work towards establishing better processes on-the-ground to enable higher precision in reporting.Title: Design to Development Journey – GiveIndia.org

==================================================

“Well begun is half done”  – This is very true in case of project execution as well. We,
Think201
believe in starting off on a right note to ensure the rest of the project journey is nice & neat.
Currently, we are in the development phase of the Data Collection & Reporting Project which we are doing for GiveIndia.org (
read here
). Our previous step,
design phase
, had a good impact on streamlining thoughts, ideas & finalizing at what we are looking at as an end product. We finished designing screens for all roles which is an
interactive link
depicting the final product outcome much before the product was built.
The interface was then shared with the GiveIndia team as well to gather initial feedback & comments from the NGO teams who are our end-users of what we are developing. The early feedback helped in altering a couple of screens in the design phase itself & also gave us an insight that we are headed in the right direction.
The interface designs became a guiding tool to the GiveIndia team too to design APIs to return the response of what is just needed.
Current Project Progress Updates
We took a UI (front end development) first approach to develop the screens designed across roles & booted the application. The application now has screens developed & tied together using internal APIs which matches the response structure. We pivoted to this approach so that we can make the best utilization of time & make the whole process efficient. Our team is marching ahead in developing all the screens & also towards building PWA.
Our constant weekly meetings are helping us to exchange any queries/ updates without any hindrance which has kept the momentum of the project going on.
What we plan next?
We plan complete frontend development & move towards API binding (which will be coming from GiveIndia team) .We are also looking at Automation testing for the platform which involves UI Automation Testing  & API testing.
Very soon, we will be making the application live in a staging environment & make it available to others to have a look at it.
Technology Stack Used
One major pivot which happened was in the choice of frontend technology. We switched to React from AngularJS since other applications that exist (at GiveIndia) are all built on NodeJS & React.
React – For FrontEnd Development
NodeJS – For Backend ( APIs, provided by GiveIndia)
SailsJS – For intermediate Post APIs which we will be developing
Mocha Framework, Protractor – For Automation Testing

==================================================

Here Im sitting near marine drive writing this blog and thinking about all the conversations I had with NGOs over the last two weeks. I have a lot to talk about regarding what were doing with the Data Platform. We had our third sprint with NGOs this year and for me personally, this was different from the other two sprints. For this sprint, I was more open to conversations with NGOs and trying to understand the problem that they are trying to solve.
As
Lobo
explained to me in the cab when I asked him a question about If
Glific
is fit for a
MAD
(Make a Difference) NGO. He explained to me that think about what problem they are trying to solve and dont just think from a tech perspective. Which gives me enough perspective to think outside of the box.
While the location was so beautiful we used some time to talk about data challenges with Tejas from Reap Benefit which I got to know in detail. He also showed us the there dashboard and different data sources of the data they have. Also I had a really great conversation with Sushmita about there data and how CRM can help them to solve some data problems. Other than this we really enjoyed talking to funders and explain them about the data platform.
So now I want to give you some updates on how are we building the data platform and different
POC (proof of concept) is going on.
1. We have
STIR EDUCATION
an international NGO that supports education systems to reignite intrinsic motivation so that every child, teacher, and official is motivated to learn and improve. Our vision is a world where teachers love teaching and children love learning.
So Stir Education was facing some data challenges and this is our first POC which we started a few months back. We completed the full pipeline for them which includes data ingestion and cleaning up the data. Which was a lot of learning for me.
2. Then we started working with
SNEHA(Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action)
around the same time. We build the full-fledged pipeline which includes pulling data from Commcare through airbyte, DBT to clean their data, and finally showing the data on Superset.
But this time I visited them in Mumbai just after the sprint to work closely with them and met their whole team. We showed them the whole data pipeline which weve built for them and answering their questions on the spot was a wholesome feeling. I also asked Abhishek to come with me because he can think outside of tech space which I used to think about all the time.
3. Our third POC is with the partnership with
goalkeep
. We have been working with
Swapneel
who is helping
Dost Education
with their data and they believed in us and the DDP platform which can help with the whole data related problem which Dost Education was facing.
Goalkeep and we got a chance to show our work with the DDP work to NGOs and many of them were interested to know more about the Data Platform. Swapneel has written a really nice
blog
that can explain this a little bit more.
These few months I really enjoyed working with different NGOs and trying to understand their data-related problems. Weve been talking to TAP(The Apprentice Project), Reap Benefit and
Antarang Foundation. Lots of exciting work coming for us and seeing different use cases and data problems will really help us with what we want in a Data Platform.
Now Im leaving you with one more pic from Lobos place and he was really kind enough to invite me to stay at his place. Just wanted to say Thankyou for that. Hopefully, we can do many long walks 🙂Title: Development Data Platform

==================================================

The Development Data Platform (DDP) provides a low maintenance, low cost, SaaS data platform composed of open source software elements to tackle data ingestion, storage, transformation and visualisation. It mirrors a modern data stack found in the private sector, while specialising in integration tools and is tailored to the needs and goals of the development sector.
This platform came about from our experience of working with multiple organisations in the Indian NGO ecosystem where we saw challenges in disjointed data sources, data ingestion pipelines constantly breaking down and needing to be fixed with changes in data schemas, data synchronisation problems between source data and data warehouses, data quality issues, up-to-date versioned documentation of data transformations and aggregations, and usage of open source visualisation tools.
It was also influenced by how we can work with NGOs to use data in a “smart” manner to provide better, deeper and more meaningful insights for greater impact.
DDP leverages the power of data to optimise processes and program operations. The platform replicates data from multiple existing tools used by the social impact space organisations (like CommCare, SurveyCTO, Glific, Avni, Google Sheets) as part of an open source data integration pipeline that has high visibility of issues and maximum uptime. Using top of the line open source packages for transformations and visualisations, DDP aims to satisfy the analysis and visualisation needs across most NGOs.
We are currently in beta mode piloting with a few non-profit  organisations.Title: Development updates of Toybank
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: October 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/development-updates-of-toybank/
==================================================

Odoo implementation dropped?
The initial engagement with Odoo for implementing the Inventory Management for Toybank helped us to understand,
Odoo system is hard to understand and use because of complex workflow and usability issues.
Issues faced like having multiple steps to perform tasks such as adding inventory, multistep request approval process, etc…
Toybanks main requirement for generating toy requests is based on the category of toys i.e allocating the toy categories instead of individual toys.
We didn?t find any freely available inventory system which fit with Toybank requirement.
So considering these issues/requirements and based on discussion with the client we collectively taken a decision to drop the Odoo implementation and look for another solution that best suits the core requirement.
We decided to use Drupal
Drupal 8 –  a leading open-source CMS
Features of Drupal 8
Open-source CMS
Page layout customization
Custom content types and content listings
Custom modules
Various access control restrictions (user roles)
Third-party contributed modules and themes to extend or override Drupal’s default behaviors without changing Drupal core’s code thus increasing flexibility
Due to the above features and flexibility in code customization, Drupal 8 is finalized.
Since this was custom development we created mockups for various workflows for Toybank.
Mockup creation – balsamiq.cloud
As per the requirement of Inventory Management System for Toybank we have created the Mockups using
https://balsamiq.cloud
.
We made use of the Balsamiq wireframe to create a visual guide for the client to better understand what they are going to be seen and experienced and can judge if the solution adequately addresses their needs.
After finalizing the mockups we were started the actual development of a fully customized Inventory Management System.
Gitlab Project Management System – To track the project updates
We are using Gitlab based PMS system to keep track of development work. It has the capacity to help plan, organize, and manage resource tools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication of the software, it can manage estimation and planning, scheduling and resource allocation. Added and assign tasks to each team member on a daily basis into the tracking system. which keeps Consistency of flow.
Current status of the project
We have implemented the following functionality:
User Management
Play Centers Management
Administer various masters
KBIs, Partner, Cluster, Source/Pickup, etc…
Inventory workflows
Key workflows: Request generation, Auditing
Challenges faced
The main road blocker of the system was generating a game request on behalf of the play center due to its complex flow and making it user-friendly. To tackle this, we provided a customized form that is simpler and easier to use in terms of UI and functionality. This was implemented using a custom drupal module specific to this project.
As of today, the majority part of the project is mostly done, except for the reports.Title: Digitization of SHOFCO’s Gender Program and Adoption: Lessons Learned and Progress
Author: Vinod Rajasekaran
Date: February 2025
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/digitization-of-shofcos-gender-program-and-adoption-lessons-learned-and-progress/
==================================================

Summary
SHOFCO’s Gender Program addresses gender inequalities by safeguarding women and girls and reducing gender-based violence (GBV) across 10 counties in Kenya. A 2023 digitization effort faced adoption challenges due to system usability issues. In late 2024, SHOFCO improved user experience, transitioned to a cost-effective data platform (Dalgo), enhanced data visualization with Superset, and introduced role-specific dashboards to strengthen data privacy. These changes have increased adoption and efficiency. Building on this success, SHOFCO is expanding the approach to WASH, Education, and other key programs in 2025, ensuring data-driven decision-making and improved service delivery.
Background
SHOFCO’s Gender Program seeks to address gender inequalities by transforming mindsets, safeguarding women and girls, and promoting inclusion at all levels of society. Its long-term objective is to reduce gender-based violence (GBV) and create an environment where girls can thrive.
Through SHOFCO’s community network (SUN), the program takes a comprehensive, community-driven approach in urban informal settlements and rural areas across 10 counties in Kenya. Its key initiatives include:
Holistic Support for Survivors
: The program provides survivors of GBV with counseling, access to healthcare and legal assistance, emergency protection through safehouse accommodation, and livelihoods training. This work is carried out by SHOFCO’s gender staff—including caseworkers, counselors, and volunteers—who operate gender desks within the community.
Engaging Men & Community Leaders
: SHOFCO identifies and trains male allies and key community stakeholders as
Gender Champions
, equipping them to refer survivors for support, lead awareness campaigns, and advocate for positive social change.
Strengthening Partnerships with Law Enforcement & Healthcare Providers
: The program collaborates with law enforcement agencies and SHOFCO’s health clinics to ensure a coordinated and effective response to GBV.
Empowering Adolescents
: Life skills and rights education are provided to adolescent girls and boys through both in-school and out-of-school programs, fostering a generation that champions gender equality.
Data plays a critical role in the program.
It enables staff to manage cases effectively, track survivor needs, and monitor progress—sometimes over extended periods, such as during legal proceedings. Additionally, facilitators use data to track participant engagement in life skills and Gender Champion programs, conduct surveys, and assess overall program impact. This information is essential for both internal decision-making and reporting to funders.
In 2023, SHOFCO’s Gender Program underwent digitization in partnership with a technology and data provider. The system was implemented on CommCare, but adoption challenges arose due to a slow and buggy interface. Caseworkers reported system delays of up to 2 minutes to load each case entry, leading to frustration and reduced adoption. Low usage among caseworkers led to reliance on alternative methods, such as paper records and Excel sheets, making it difficult to operationalize data, manage the program effectively, and assess impact.
Approach Taken
To address these challenges, SHOFCO undertook a structured approach with a focus on usability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
1. Enhancing User Experience (UI/UX) and System Performance
The redesign prioritized a
simpler and more intuitive interface
for caseworkers while keeping the system on CommCare.
Bug fixes and key enhancements
were prioritized to improve speed and usability.
Offline data availability of cases was restricted
to specific gender centers, resolving major UI/UX challenges in searching for cases while maintaining necessary functionality.
2. Transition to a Cost-Effective and Scalable Data Platform
SHOFCO moved from a
custom cloud-based data infrastructure
maintained by an external vendor to
Dalgo
, a standardized
data outcomes platform
.
The custom platform had been initially set up in 2023 with another vendor, and transitioning to it fully in 2024 reduced costs and removed the burden of maintaining in-house data infrastructure without dedicated engineering capacity.
3. Improving Data Visualization and Privacy
Superset
, an open-source data visualization platform, replaced
Microsoft Power BI
, allowing for
private dashboards
—a critical requirement for gender-related data privacy.
A
Key Questions Framework
was introduced to define visualizations: identifying who needs the data, why they need it, and what actions they will take based on the insights.
4. Tailored Dashboards for Different Program Roles
Recognizing that a single
unified
dashboard was overwhelming, the team introduced role-specific dashboards, ensuring each user type could access relevant insights efficiently.
New
role-specific dashboards
were created, including:
Program dashboards
for overall management and impact tracking.
Caseworker and counselor dashboards
tailored to their specific workflows.
This restructuring also improved
data privacy
, ensuring GBV survivors’ case data was accessible only to assigned caseworkers while limiting access for other program staff as necessary.
5. Continuous Improvement and Adoption
The approach emphasized
ongoing feedback, iterative design, and building data adoption and trust
among users.
As of early 2025, caseworkers and program staff have responded positively, with increased system usage and improved user experience. System adoption has increased tremendously to most caseworkers using the system mostly daily. It has not been all smooth sailing and the deployment has had teething troubles of establishing data culture and how to have continuous feedback across the entire data lifecycle and associated roles involved in it.

Counseling Impact Dashboard to enable feedback of the counseling sessions and improvement in mental health among survivors due to the intervention
Case Worker Dashboard showcasing the operational nature of data reflected on it to enable day-to-day work by case workers and counselors
Scaling the Approach
Encouraged by the success of these improvements, SHOFCO has adopted the same approach for
WASH and Education programs
and plans to extend it to
Sustainable Livelihoods, Libraries, and Health
throughout 2025.
By focusing on
usability, cost efficiency, and data-driven decision-making
, SHOFCO is ensuring that digital transformation strengthens program management and impact while safeguarding sensitive data.Title: Dogfooding Glific: What I Learned by Being a User for a Week
Author: Akansha
Date: May 2025
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/dogfooding-glific-what-i-learned-by-being-a-user-for-a-week/
==================================================

After our Mahabalipuram sprint, Shamoon shared something that stayed with me long after the trip ended:
“I’ve realized we need to use our own products, Glific and Dalgo, more effectively. By ‘using,’ I mean becoming users ourselves for different use cases. This will help us better understand their strengths and identify areas that need improvement.”
As a developer, I’ve often been so deep into working on features or fixing bugs that I rarely step back to ask
what are we really building?
And more importantly,
how does it feel to be on the other side, as a user?
So, ahead of the next sprint, I wanted to experience the process end-to-end, from planning to execution much like how an NGO might run a small pilot. That’s when the idea for the Sprint Bot started to take shape.
The first thing I did was reach out to our sprint planning group Abhishek, Anto, Deepak, and Diana  and pitched the idea:
“What if we had a bot for session nudges and reminders?”
On the surface, it seemed simple: a flow and a trigger. But once I got started, the complexity quickly revealed itself.
Version One: A Simple Start with a Few Bumps
In theory, all I had to do was set up a scheduled flow to send reminders. But I quickly realized we had 8 to 12 messages going out each day at specific times. Doing this manually or with individual triggers would be messy and hard to scale.
The next logical step was to try a dynamic flow using custom expressions to get the current time and then pulling the message content from a Google Sheet using it as a key. But I hit a snag. Even with a time-based trigger, by the time the flow started and fetched data from the Sheet, a few seconds and sometimes even a full minute had already passed. That delay made the reminders unreliable.
Version Two: Enter Google Apps Script
So I tried a different approach.
I wrote a Google Apps Script that worked alongside a
Google Sheet
with five columns:
Key, Date, Message,
and
Processed.
The script scanned the Sheet, created time-based triggers for each scheduled message, and when the time came, it would start a Glific flow using the message’s key. Inside Glific, the flow fetched the message from the Google Sheet using the @results.message_number variable, passed through the “Start a Flow” API and the “Link a Google Sheet” node.
When it worked… It felt amazing. A simple setup but it worked exactly when and how I wanted. I was thrilled and super excited for the sprint to begin.
But Then I Noticed Something…
I had spent a day testing everything, and that’s when I spotted the problem.
Yes, the reminders were on time. The bot was doing its job.
But it was quiet.
There was no engagement. No replies. No reactions. Just another ping in a sea of pings.
I wanted to take it one step further to make the bot more than just functional. I wanted it to be engaging. So I thought of adding a few simple interactive elements to see if that would make the experience more engaging. And once the bot was live during the sprint, it was great to see people actually responding and playing along, answering questions, and interacting with it.
There were photo scavenger hunts, quick trivia questions, and quirky little games slotted between sprint sessions. These tiny touches added a playful spark to the day and the bot started to feel less like a tool and more like a part of the sprint.
The Daily Sprint Schedule
In addition to reminders, I also set up the bot to send out the
day’s full sprint schedule
every morning — neatly organized by product. It quickly became a useful anchor for everyone to refer back to throughout the day.
The Steps Challenge
One of the sprint activities already planned was the
Steps Challenge
six teams, tracking their daily step counts, with a light touch of friendly competition to the week.
As soon as I saw it on the sprint plan, I knew:
this is where the Sprint Bot could really shine
.
I created a Glific flow for submitting daily steps. Each evening, the bot would ask users to upload a screenshot or photo of their health app or smartwatch step count. And every morning, the leaderboard was shared.
I used the
GPT Vision webhook
to read the image and then stored the steps in a google sheet along with team names.
Here’s the prompt I used:
“Here’s an image showing a step count from a fitness app or device. Please look at the image and extract only the number of steps walked today. Return just the number, no extra text. Make sure the steps are of today by checking if the picture either has today or today’s date in it.”
It worked beautifully.
Well… until someone got creative.
Turns out, the same AI tools I used to
read
step counts could also be used to
generate
them. A few folks experimented with fake screenshots using ChatGPT — and some of them passed the check.
It was a fun twist I hadn’t anticipated, but it gave me the nudge to improve things further.
The Leaderboard
Each morning, the leaderboard updated with team totals and rankings — all generated automatically using Glific’s new
Custom Certificates
feature and Google Sheets.
It wasn’t just a static scoreboard. It quietly kept the momentum going and gave everyone a little something to look forward to each morning.
The winning team of the steps challenge was
Team Thomas
, consisting of Vijay, Pratiksha, Diana, Tejas, Krishna, Stuti and Erica. They stood out not just for their step count, but for remembering to submit their entries every single day.
Looking Back
This whole experiment started with a simple reminder bot. But along the way, I got a front-row seat to what it really takes to build
for
users not just as a developer.
Here are a few things I took away from the experience:
How tricky “simple” things can be when timing and scale matter.
Why interactivity and engagement matter just as much as functionality.
What it takes for NGOs to design and test flows that truly work for their communities.
And honestly? I had a lot of fun doing it.
It was a small idea that turned into a meaningful learning experience one that gave me a deeper appreciation for the tools we build, and the people we build them for.
By stepping into the user’s shoes, even briefly, I not only understood the gaps more clearly but also rediscovered the joy of building with empathy.Title: Ecosystem Thinking in Action: Insights from Dasra Philanthropy Week and the AI Sprint

==================================================

Attending two incredible events in February and March—Dasra Philanthropy Week (DPW) and the AI for Global Development Sprint—gave me the chance to reflect on the sector more, reconnect with old friends, and build new relationships. Both gatherings deepened my understanding of how NGOs are thinking about AI and philanthropy, making them fulfilling experiences that I hope to see more of in the coming year.
Reflections from Dasra Philanthropy Week
This year’s in-person Dasra Philanthropy Week in Mumbai took on a refreshing new format. The first day focused on closed-door, deep-dive discussions, while the second day brought together the broader ecosystem – funders, NGOs, and enablers for open conversations and panel discussions. I found this structure particularly effective: a day for focused engagement followed by a day of diverse perspectives.
While there were many insightful sessions, one that really made me think was
“
Shaping New Paradigms in Corporate Giving
“
. As I listened to CSR leaders and grassroots NGO representatives, one thought kept surfacing while both aspire to collaborate effectively, there’s often a disconnect in understanding each other’s realities. NGOs, already stretched thin, struggle with the heavy burden of reporting requirements, while CSR teams, though empathetic, are bound by the rigid processes of their larger corporate structures. The key takeaway more dialogue, more understanding, and more internal advocacy. CSRs need to push for more relevant, flexible reporting frameworks, and NGOs need to recognize that corporate funding comes with its own set of constraints.
In the late afternoon, Project Tech4Dev hosted a closed-door session for NGOs looking to shape their tech strategy. Led by Vinod (Fractional CxO Program Lead), Anto (Fractional CxO), and Abhishek Nair (Product Manager), the session took a hands-on, gamified approach -an attempt to make tech decision-making more engaging for non-tech leaders.
I was initially curious – how do you gamify a discussion on tech strategy? But as the session unfolded, I found myself fully engaged, pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. As participants started discussing the path they would take when defining their tech interventions most organizations defaulted to thinking about building custom tech solutions rather than leveraging existing platforms.
This left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I felt a bit sad that despite years of challenges with custom-built tech, NGOs are still willing to try again, hoping this time will be different. On the other hand, I saw a huge opportunity to shift mindsets toward platform-based solutions that are cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable.
If there’s one thing I would love for more NGOs to consider, it’s this:
Why start from scratch when platforms already exist to support your work?
It’s faster and more cost-effective—you’re not building alone but benefiting from a community-driven approach.
You don’t have to worry about maintenance—the developer community takes care of that.
Even if a platform meets 70% of your needs, it’s often a smarter choice than investing resources into a custom-built solution.
This is a conversation I want to keep having, so if you’re interested in learning more, reach out at
erica@projecttech4dev.org
.
Beyond the sessions, DPW was also a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with sector peers. A huge thanks to the Dasra team for curating such a thoughtful gathering—it provided plenty of food for thought, opportunities to reflect and collaborate, and a chance to reshape narratives for the better.
AI for Global Development Sprint
In March, I attended the AI for Global Development Sprint, a 3-day gathering organized by The Agency Fund and Tech4Dev in Bangalore. The sprint brought together 90+ participants from healthcare, education, agriculture, and tech, all eager to explore how generative AI and ML can address development challenges. Designed for peer learning and hands-on collaboration, it created a space where funders and implementers could deeply engage, ensuring AI solutions stay grounded in real-world needs.
At the heart of the sprint were seven incredible organizations – Jacaranda Health, Rocket Learning, Reach Digital Health, Digital Green, Precision Agriculture, Youth Impact, and Noora Health each embarking on a year-long journey to develop their AI use cases, backed by funding from The Agency Fund and guided by AI experts.
I’m becoming a huge fan of cohort-based programs especially in evolving spaces like AI, where many organizations are still shaping their strategies. These cohorts foster open, honest conversations about successes, failures, experiments, and lessons learned. More and more, I see organizations willing to share deeply and authentically, making gatherings like this invaluable.
What made this sprint even more special was the rare but much-needed collaboration between funders and implementers in the same room. It was great to see Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies, BMGF, ATECF, Fidelity Foundation, Koita Foundation and Give Grant engaging directly, keen to understand where AI in the sector is headed and how we can align efforts for greater impact.
We also had two fantastic keynote speakers – Manu from Karya and Vivek Raghavan from Sarvam AI – who shared rich insights from their experience in the space.
The discussions were dynamic and thought-provoking – each NGO presented their AI use cases, followed by breakout groups in health, agriculture, and education, where funders and implementers came together to explore challenges and opportunities in AI-driven solutions. The day wrapped up with a funder roundtable, offering a platform for reflection and alignment on how we can collectively strengthen the AI ecosystem.
The sprint was a powerful reminder that we’re all navigating this AI journey together some a few steps ahead, others just starting, but all learning and evolving. The group will reconvene in Nairobi mid-year, culminating in a year-end showcase where NGOs will present their progress. I’m truly excited to witness this evolution—how much we’ll have learned and grown as a community in just one year!
Looking Ahead
At Project Tech4Dev, we would love to enable and run more cohort-based programs like this – if you’re a funder looking to support such initiatives, happy to have a conversation!
This sprint was an incredibly fulfilling and rich learning experience from thought-provoking discussions to new friendships and collaborations. It feels great that Project Tech4Dev can convene such ecosystem-building events with like-minded partners. In April/May, we’re planning a similar roundtable with CSR heads – if you are interested in being part of it do reach out.Title: Education Cohort Day 1

Early Tuesday morning, we woke up to the sound of rain and to the likeliness of a canceled trek. Thanks to Amit and Subash, our guides who didnt bail on us, we got ready and set out at 7:30 am geared with our ponchos and umbrellas.
It was a short trek up, with the sound of rain keeping us company and the frequent whistling of the Malabar Whistling Thrush, sometimes overpowering our chattering! We reached the top to an overcast sky and barely any visibility of the reservoir below us.
The highlight of the trek was the not-so-quick stop at the waterfall on our way back. We took our guides instructions to take a dip a little too seriously and sat under the waterfall as the water dropped aggressively on our backs.
This set our energy levels high for the day, even though there was passing of muscle relaxants around for some of us.
Post lunch, we sat through a quick and fun presentation by Shamoon from the
ColoredCow
team where he highlighted
Glific
s efforts toward Natural Language Processing with Dialogflow.
Shared Learning
We had different organizations presenting their work throughout the day.
The Apprentice Project
presented their work with a focus on their Whatsapp Bot, popularly known as Tap Buddy amongst their young users! Krishna Priya, from TAP, took us through the different features available on Tap Buddy, their experience of working with young children, and their learnings so far.
Krishna is passionate about digging deep into gamification and she says shes still on level 1 of learning the tricks to gamification and has many more to conquer. We should talk more about this, I made a mental note.
Post dinner, we regrouped to learn more about the work some of the NGOs were doing. We had Sandeep Vengsarkar from
Antarang Foundation
presenting their work towards making youngsters career-ready and their Whatsapp aka career-bot, Nantar Kay He mentioned how the difference between the baseline and end line is what we are all working towards and this stuck with me.
Neha Ganatra, from
Pehlay Akshar
, spoke about the different initiatives they have in place to achieve their goal of
empowering every child with English Literacy and developing a Learning Mindset,
Neha also has quite a few fun energizers up her sleeve! We got to do a fun one together.
Prachi Mishra from
Lend a Hand India
shared the work that they do in integrating vocational education into secondary and higher education. Their bot has a fun Bitmoji too! What stood out to me as I sat there listening to presenters was a clear articulation of what theyve seen work well, a good understanding of their end-users, challenges faced along the way, but mostly the drive to explore, apply and learn from every experience.
I am writing these reflections at the end of the day, sitting outside on the chair watching the rain as a firefly passes by. Im taking some time to think of all the conversations I have had throughout the day and soaking all the learnings in. The energy to collaborate and the urge to learn that you get to see around you in this space is contagious. Heres to continuing sharing and learning from each other, whether its with bhaji and chai, on walks in the rain, or in a huddle with the team.Title: Education Cohort Day 3: The Gift of Learning

Slam Out Loud
Its Day 3 at the Glific sprint and it is another day of thundering rains! But just like this rain has cut through the hills to form beautiful waterfalls, we have imbibed its spirit to learn and grow through it all.
The day started with everyone strolling into the dining hall, conversing over breakfast, and bidding adieu to some members (and our beloved Karaoke) with a promise to meet again in the next sprint. After all the goodbyes came to the learning sessions. We had
EdZola
present their work. They have been working to bridge the gap between technology and NGOs, a timely and urgent problem to solve. It was wonderful to learn how EdZola is helping bridge the prevalent gap by bringing in technology to enable the impact of the NGOs they work with.
We then had a talk by Rahul from
V-School: Liberating Education
, an initiative that was started in August 2018 by a group of socially active, passionate engineers. A unique feature of their program is its contextual and localized content. They have content in languages that the children speak, including Marathi and Urdu. That is not all! You will find various dialects of the same language being used in their content, to make learning contextual. V-School has enabled e-learning in the classroom through resources catering to all. Get in touch with them and learn from their experience to bring affordable and accessible content to your work.
With all the inspiring talks we had in the morning, the conversation continued over tea and coffee with clouds, rains, and waterfalls in the background. What more can one ask for! We then moved into our afternoon session with Surya presenting about
Avanti Fellows
. They work on providing free mentoring and tools to children from underserved communities to support them in getting admission to top government colleges. Surya also brought the power of Rajnikant (Sivaji) like a boss with his AI talk where he opened a whole new world for us to finetune and review things.
Click

, play around, finetune and review your work, from art to text!
We then had yours truly,
Slam Out Loud
, present their work and engage everyone in a poetry activity. It was a joy to take everyone through our work over the years and also listen to poems of hope and sleepiness (understandable) to take us along. Bringing art to the space and having people engage in The Gift of Poetry felt amazing.
In conclusion, the sprint has been a great learning journey with organizations, individuals, and experiences to learn from every day. One of our major takeaways was the amazing work that is being done across the board and the need for connection, communication, and collaboration to multiply impact. Something that stood out from the conversations and sessions was the quantity and quality of work done by NGOs in leveraging tech for their programs. While there is still a long way to go, the sessions helped us explore the diverse ways NGOs are using their chatbot to reach and engage their beneficiaries, the evolution of their chatbots, the solutions they have implemented, and ignited the hope of having technology enable the impact of our programs.
There are a lot of learnings to take back and implement at
Slam Out Loud
. One idea that has stood out has been the concept of articulating key questions for our programs, their importance, and the fact that old questions will generate new ones thus allowing organizations to evolve and reach their goals. The sprint has helped me work on challenges with the Glific team and brainstorms ideas to make the chatbot more meaningful, engaging, and impactful. We are going away with a head full of questions, insights, some solutions found and some to find.
With a mind full of learning and a heart full of joy, we are ending the blog with a takeaway that defines the sprint for us – No task is too big when done together – this sprint is an apt example of seeing this power of collaboration and the collective! With a feeling of hope, growth, and a lot of learning, we slowly move to the last dayonly to meet again soon for new learning in the next sprint.Title: Education Cohort to increase engagement through Whatsapp Chatbot

==================================================

Happy to announce that we at
Glific
have partnered with
CISCO
and
The Agency Fund
to launch a year-long program – beginning May 2022 – for our NGO partners working in the Education space. Our whatsapp based chatbot,
Glific
, has helped several NGOs engage more meaningfully with their beneficiaries and at scale. We are inviting NGOs working in the Education Space who would like to explore a two-way communication channel to reach out to their communities in a targeted manner. About6-8 NGOs have already signed up for the program and we are open to having a few more. Spaces are filling fast so, if you want to join reach out to us at
info@glific.org
The program aims to help you
increase engagement with your beneficiaries as well as analyze conversations for behavioral insights that will help you effect lasting change
.
Who is eligible ?
Any organisation that enhances teaching and learning, especially in preK-8 math, literacy, technology engineering and/or science
How will it work ?
The program consists of 4 one-week-long sprints (really just a get together at an interesting location) in the last month of every quarter – June, September, December, March.
It is designed for existing Glific users as well as aspirants
You will commit at least 1 person from your organization that will attend all 4 sprints. We strongly recommend that those who attend in June continue on till March.
You share with the team  a concept note (your thoughts) on how you might be better positioned to engage with your users than you are today.  In this note you could:
Propose a new feature in Glific, or integration with some popular external tools
Explore a new program design
And finally, state how these changes may have a positive impact on your reach
A Tip : Try to keep your concept note as broad as you can for education space rather than too specific to your organization – such as build a dashboard or a particular message flow
And what will we do?
Cover your costs (travel, food, stay) for one participant
Provide you 3 hours of pro-bono consultation time to co-create the concept note with you(if you wish)
Cover the consulting and development charged to build your desired solution with you
Do take this opportunity to make our WhatsApp chatbot(Glific) work better for you.  It is also a rare opportunity to connect with like-minded NGOs over a sustained period of time. We want to
finalize the NGOs for this cohort by May 15
.
So please share the details with us at
info@glific.org
–  preferably in advance of that – especially if you are a first-time user of Glific. We will come back to you with specific dates and locations for the sprint following that. Looking forward to hearing from you.Title: Education Cohort: A lesson in mindfulness

==================================================

This blog post is written by Kalindi from
Key Education Foundation
This piece comes from a beautiful setting in the Sahyadri Mountains, an outdoor retreat location called
Garud Maachi
, about 80 km away from Pune, Maharashtra. I am here with my colleague Sheetal, representing our organization
Key Education Foundation
in the first sprint of the
Glific
Education Cohort for the year 2022 23 organized by
Tech4Dev
.
Before leaving Bangalore, I was imagining the sprint as a 5-day residential workshop event, where we would learn about the work different NGOs do, how they use technology in their solutions, and the different features available in the Glific platform that we could include in our solution. While that isnt far from the target objectives of the sprint, it didnt capture the larger purpose (which I will get to by the time I end the blog). What I should also mention is that in my visualization, the learning was confined to structured sessions inside a hall.
Group session on Day 1 of the sprint
The fact that I was proven wrong on that last sentence is something that I feel very fortunate about.
On the second day of our sprint, about 15 of us decided to hike to a waterfall in the morning. It was drizzling when we started, but we proceeded amidst some initial concerns about safety since we had two expert guides with us. The only instructions that our guide gave us were to walk in single file and to keep our hands’ free while climbing which meant not walking with hands in our pockets, and not using our phones while walking.
In hindsight, that second instruction might as well have been be present.
That the scenery was beautiful would be an understatement. You cant put together mountains, forests, monsoon, mist, streams, and birds and not be mesmerized. Every breath was invigorating, every direction you looked at was filled with serenity, and the native sounds of streams and birds carried over our chatter and the occasional noise of vehicles crossing the highway, making their presence felt, and adding to the richness of the experience. To reach the highest point where we climbed to, we had to hold on to a rope that our guides had buckled around some trees and rocks. While the walking distance might not have been more than 200 meters, it was definitely the most difficult part of the terrain that we covered during the trek. But the clearing where we reached after that, made the entire effort worth it. On our way back. We spent time at a waterfall. While some in the group went all the way under the falling stream, I satisfied myself with just my feet dipping in the water. It seemed like the perfect way to catch my breath and let some of that serenity fill me.
But as we sat that night discussing and reflecting on that hike, what I realized is that more than anything, the walk was a lesson in mindfulness. At every moment I was aware of everything around me the uneven, wet ground, the trees, and branches to duck under or step over or hold on to for support, the crevices between the stones to put my foot on so I wouldnt slip, the moss to avoid stepping on, even the length of the stride to take, the person in the front or the back who could provide or need support. And all this while taking in the beauty of the environment that I was in.
And this is how I now connect the experience of the trek to the sprint, and even to our daily lives.
A big part of learning is the source the people, the conversations, the presentations, the content etc. But it all comes to naught if one isnt present. During meetings, and alone or group work times how much progress would we be able to make if we are engaging in too many conversations, or working on too many problems at the same time? At home, would we do justice to our role as a family member child, sibling, spouse, parent if were only focused on completing chores or thinking about work? Wouldnt we be neglecting the beauty that our life, our world has to offer to us if were always on the run?
The fact that the sprint was in a remote (and picturesque) location, and bereft of too much structure, adds immense value to the strengthening of the ecosystem of the development sector. Here, at the sprint, we had organizations working on housing and sanitation sector, civic engagement of citizens, education of children of ages ranging from 3 to 18, art education, career and livelihood coming together apart from various organizations that provide technological support, and monitoring and evaluation support as open-source solutions. The opportunity to really be present in the space, and engage with people in different kinds of discussions formal, informal and outright fun is what paves the way for these different organizations to come together and continue to work for the one common passion that unites us all social impact.
We leave for Bangalore today. I dont think I speak just for myself in saying that this experience has been valuable in more ways than one. Sincere respect to
Tech4Dev
for holding this space, to all the participants who helped in planning the logistics, making the arrangements, and keeping things running smoothly, and of course to everyone who shared their time and attention for these conversations.
Who knew an exhausting but refreshing trek would have connected all these dots together?Title: Education cohort – Sprint 1

==================================================

On Friday 8th July, Glific concluded the first of the four education cohort sprints of the year. Glifics Education cohort is a year long engagement with NGO partners who work towards improving learning outcomes for students. The program is structured as 4 1-week long offsites, one each quarter, where the Glific team and selected NGO partners work together to identify and solve the problems for tech-enabled education programs that use Glific. The program is supported by our funding partners – The Agency Fund and Cisco.
Since its launch in May, we have invited NGOs to apply and worked with our existing partners to find fitment with the program. The final participants and attendees of the sprint were –
The Apprentice Project
,
Reap Benefit
,
Key Education Foundation
,
Pehlay Akshar
,
VOPA
and
Slam out Loud
.
Glific
forms a core part of their program. They engage with their users in the following ways – sending weekly activities, lesson plans, engaging them in innovative civic activities, increasing engagement with their content etc At the cohort we were also joined by a few other NGOs such as Antarang Foundation, Avanti Fellows, Lend a Hand India and Indus Action who were keen about our development plan. It is great to have them as a part of the community and contribute to the shared learning space for the social impact sector.
Under the banner of education cohort we want to solve the challenges an NGO might face with running their programs. We learnt from our NGOs a few common challenges that they all face such as
Collecting information about the individual users based on their journey on the chatbot. This will enable sending report cards, leaderboards, content recommendations, managing points and badges and other interventions for a personalised learning journey.
There are often multiple kids at home who use the same phone to access WhatsApp and hence NGOs need to be able to differentiate between the users and make it easy for both of them to interact with the chatbot without mixing up their learning journeys
Making it easier to manage content. Many NGO staff members prefer to keep their content in sheets or even retrieve information in it.
Identifying the problems and aligning all the NGO partners over it has always been the process we follow for any new design to the product. Education cohort has started off on the same note. In the first sprint each NGO has planned how they will leverage the cohort for more impactful programs. The time we all spent at GarudMaachi in the outskirts of Pune, helped in building a common understanding of the problems. It helped different organisations connect and learn from each other. Its really important for people to know whats happening in the space so that a shared vision can be influenced and a lot of waste with duplicate work and narrow view of possibilities can be eliminated. Coming together in shared space for a week sways people to acknowledge each others work and learn from it. We hope to have achieved a fair degree.
The first sprint was structured to give all NGOs a chance to present their work. We started mornings with a deep dive into NGOs work and how they leverage Glific and other technology. Then the Glific team presented new updates and progress we have been working on. And in the evenings, we had short presentations of work by other participants. The space gave all of us enough room and flexibility to build informal connections and opportunity for most people to interact with each other over lunch, snacks, card games etc The incessant rains made it very difficult for people to go on treks and spend a lot of time outside. But the more adventurous ones did manage to get out even while it rained. Our evenings were filled with intense card games that were really great ice breakers, karaoke nights and sharing poetry and personal stories.
For the upcoming sprints we will continue to build the solutions we have planned for the cohort. We will work with our NGO partners to implement and adopt it for greater success. We will measure progress, iterate and improve during the coming sprints.Title: Education cohort??sprint2

Brief intro
On Friday 16th September, Glific concluded the second of the four education cohort sprints of the year. Glifics Education cohort is a year long engagement with NGO partners who work towards improving learning outcomes for students. The program is structured as four1-week long offsite??one each quarter, where the Glific team and selected NGO partners work together to identify and solve the problems for tech-enabled education programs that use Glific. The program is supported by our funding partners??The Agency Fund and Cisco.
The empty chairs waiting to be filled with eager, passionate folks. A conversation happening at the back- listen in or start your own. A movement is waiting to happen. Have a seat and join in to make some impact.
Exciting highlights at a glance:
We were
joined by 5 more amazing NGO partners?
?Quest Alliance, Bhumi, SNEHA, Suno Sunao and STiR Education apart from our Education cohort NGOs.
The
presence of our ecosystem partners
such as GramVaani, Aam Digital, IDInsight, Omidyar Network India, Avni, Tech4Dev group, Dhwani and ColoredCow further enriched the group with their perspectives and tech products.
Were seeing the
power of cross-shared learnings across NGOs
which was one of our primary goals of the cohort. For example, this time Rishis(Quest Alliance) idea of Conversational pedagogy, Gautams(Reap Benefit) idea of using storing long term data for a user, Aparnas(STiR Education) findings from their chatbot gave everyone immense food for thought. And there was a lot more to go around the cohort.
We discovered some more
common areas to be automated in Glific
so that NGOs dont have to reach out to us. NGOs discovered further possibilities with Glific such as using IVR and audio based interactions facilitated on WhatsApp.
We have made
good progress on the features
we had planned for the cohort such as Multiple profiles, User tracker, Natural Language Processing and Visualisations via maps.
This sprint also brought
focus on data and analytics
led by the Data Development Platform group.
Based on our past learnings we
recorded all the sessions and happenings
at the sprint (videos coming soon!) so that we can share our stories in a better manner.
Glific has really taken a different shape in the last year. Our definition of the product is not only limited to a certain features that our users use to achieve their goals. It goes beyond that. Its an experience of being in a community. Learning from others, validating thoughts and experiments with them. Weve emphasised the use of Discord(instant messaging platform for communities) to congregate our community in one place and have herded people to find us there whenever they wanted. It was not just about good practice but an opportunity for people to find answers to common concerns to see that there are others in in it too. Yet, it seemed like there needed to be a stronger interaction and exchanges within the community. Education cohort sprint just takes things to another level by bringing the interaction out from the virtual into the real world.
The sprint is an amazing collective of intents from NGOs, funders, product designers, engineers, all coming together toward one goal of improving beneficiary lives through effective technology solutions.
Happenings at the sprint
Its always bustling with conversations. Its high on energy. Passionate people who care about the society and how they solve problems on the ground get together with a mindset to learn and share.
Huddle:
We started the sprint with getting to know the expectations of all the participants. Thanks to Tejas for running a great show and finding interactive ways to explore the thoughts from the group. We came closer to understanding their limitations, recent achievements, what they want to learn and take away from the sprint. Thats a lot of thoughts we need to process and help each other with. Itll require a continuous conversation and we hope to circle back to each of the unresolved points from time to time.
Round table support group discussions
: These were quite helpful to understand challenges that each person was facing specific to their use of Glific. Our key findings were:
Automate creation of segments of users after onboarding onto the platform
Need for a mobile app to enable swift manual responses
Interest in the IVR system and the calling functionality weve built by integrating Exotel
There were some specific operational issues which the Glific team worked individually with the NGOs and helped resolve at the sprint
Need for analytical dashboards
Round table support group discussions
Tech talks and intros
: This time morning tech talks were presented by Abhideep(Gramvaani) about their communication platform, and Nadeem & Vinitha(SNEHA) about their data platform and monitoring processes helped everyone peer into the possible outside of what each one of us does in our everyday. Similarly the intro talks by each new NGO also helped to understand what others are doing in a similar space and opens room to be curious and learn more about something that clicks with someone else.
Excursions
: We missed planning for excursion that gives a necessary break to everyone. However, thanks to the planning committee led by Erica a trip to Mussoorie was planned and people were able to spend a few hours outside of the work zone. The enthusiasm for the trip ran high in the group and it was great to see that rains didnt damped the spirit.
Not Mussoorie excursion
In all there were a lot of discussions, individually, in groups, on stage. There was a lot of exposure and tracks to take away. It was made easier with a comfort of good food, a good location, great company. Although it almost feels overwhelming whether we can take action on all the things we discussed but as Nadeem rightly said It gave a direction which one can go into details when required.
Report on the cohort??NGO stories
Some of the progress our NGO partners have been making are as as follows:
VOPA(Vowels of People Association) has onboarded 10K beneficiaries on Glific and are segmenting them based on their specific needs and information collected from them. This segmentation will enable them to send highly personalised messages and nudges such as sending weekly learning report, sending prizes and building a dashboard. They will follow it up by analysis how the interaction and behaviours changes as a result of this channel and their personalised messages.
The Apprentice Project had deployed the NLP feature with about 4K students after the first sprint and they are evaluating how it has impacted students interaction with the bot. They will further be exploring user tracker system to create personalised learning streams for each student.
Reap Benefit has deployed the user tracker system. They have been pooling all of their structured/unstructured data into this one tracker and all of the information collected on WhatsApp will also be added to the tracker. They have also launched their
Mapping report
which acts as a great visualisation tool when presenting their finding to stakeholders.
Key Education Foundation is going strong on the use of Google sheets integration we built for them. They continue to manage and build further content on the sheet. As they plan to scale their program to a lot more schools and parents, theyre working towards some behavioural challenges to make the WhatsApp channel a lot more effective at scale.
Quest Alliance has been designing their computational learning program for students in Odisha. It was really fascinating to see how they have localized the content without compromising on the quality of visuals and messaging. Well be working with them in the coming months to launch this program and I cant wait to see how it is received on the ground and the learning outcomes they achieve. Here’s a work in progress preview of the bot:

About Empower People
Empower People (EP) is an organisation working with survivors of bride trafficking in India, primarily in Haryana and Assam.
EP works with trafficking survivors on the ground who are leading the movement against bride trafficking and fighting crimes against women and children.
Current Data Management Process
EP’s On-the-ground data collection is done via photos, audio recordings and videos captured by the survivor leaders on smartphones supplied by the organisation.
Further reporting, communication and data management is over a combination of paper-based methods and various Whatsapp and Facebook groups.
Project Details and Scope
As part of the second cohort for Tech4dev, we are working together with Empower People to identify what tech solution would fit best.
We identified three primary modules for different user roles-
Survivor Leaders
Mode of use – Android App
Securely capture media files, auto upload to server
Auto-delete media after upload
Activists
Mode of use – Android App
Report on cases
NGO Admins
Mode of use – web portal and android app
Manage all case data
Access media files uploaded
We decided to target the functionality for user role 1 first, and as an app separate from the cases management app that will be used by activists .
Current Progress
We are currently exploring the possibility of using the open source Android app Tella –
https://hzontal.org/tella/
as the media reporting app.
Tella supports capture of image, audio, and video files, and stores them encrypted on the phone storage.
Together with the Tella team, we are exploring development of a configurable setting where files can be auto-uploaded to a server, and then auto-deleted from the device after the upload.
We are also working to further scope out the case management needs for activists and admins

==================================================

Abstract
:
This case study delves into how SNEHA, a prominent non-governmental organization (NGO) in the health sector, is overcoming data management challenges to streamline its operations, enhance transparency, and improve data-driven decision-making. Facing hurdles related to data organization, consolidation, and accessibility across various health interventions and beneficiary communities, SNEHA sought to democratize real-time data access for all stakeholders within the organization. The solution came in the form of “Dalgo,” a comprehensive data platform designed to empower NGOs by automating data consolidation, transformation, storage and visualization on a unified platform, potentially leading to more effective health interventions.
Introduction
:
SNEHA (Society for Nutrition, Education, and Health Action) is a well-established NGO with a mission to improve the health and well-being of underserved communities, particularly women and children. Over the years, SNEHA has initiated numerous health interventions across a diverse set of beneficiary communities, ranging from maternal, adolescent and child health programs  to preventing and addressing gender-based violence. As the organization grew and expanded its reach, it faced several data-related challenges:
Data Fragmentation
: SNEHA operated multiple health interventions simultaneously, each generating its own data. Data was often stored in silos, making it challenging to gain a holistic view of the organization’s impact.
Data Inefficiency
: Manually consolidating, cleaning, and transforming data from various sources was time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive. Though tools such as Tableau and Talend were being used, there was still a significant amount of manual intervention required for pipelines to be run error-free and for data cleaning and validation.
Data Access and Reporting
: Access to real-time data was limited to a select few, hindering the ability of field workers to better plan monthly visits to community members. Reporting was manual and often involved long turnaround times. Even though for most reporting purposes, monthly data is sufficient, field community organizers lacked the real-time data to better prioritize and track their work.
Scope for more Data-Driven Insights
: SNEHA aspired to extract meaningful insights from its operational data to drive program improvements and resource allocation but this was difficult and time-consuming due to the data-related bottlenecks.
To prepare themselves for the next stage of their growth, SNEHA sought a transformative solution, leading them to co-create the Dalgo data platform with Project Tech4Dev.
Dalgo: A Data Transformation Solution
:
Dalgo
is a cutting-edge data platform designed specifically for NGOs, enabling them to harness the power of data to achieve their missions. It simplifies data consolidation, transformation, storage, and visualization on a unified platform, making data readily accessible and actionable.
Dalgo Block Overview
Implementation at SNEHA
:
Data Integration
: Dalgo seamlessly integrated with various data sources across SNEHAs health interventions. It standardized data formats and ensured data consistency.
Data Transformation
: The platform helped simplify data cleansing, enrichment, and transformation, reducing human errors and potentially freeing up valuable staff time in the long run.
Real-time Data Access
: Intuitive dashboards on Dalgo have allowed stakeholders at all levels of the organization to access real-time data, promoting transparency and collaboration.
Automated Donor/Program Reporting
: Customized reports and dashboards were generated for internal program reviews and funders, eliminating the need for manual data analysis work for report creation; this has helped reduce reporting turnaround times significantly.
Data-Driven Insights
: With data consolidated and easily accessible, SNEHA can now better analyze trends, track program effectiveness, and make informed decisions to optimize interventions.
Malnutrition Spread of children covered by field worker to help them better focus on particular aspects of malnutrition during home visit counseling
Program Level Child Malnutrition and Immunization Metrics for program leadership to better inform and guide the intervention
Conclusion
:
By adopting the Dalgo data platform, SNEHA is transforming its data management practices, overcoming fragmentation and inefficiencies. The organization is successfully democratizing data access, automating reports, and can now potentially unlock valuable insights from its data. As a result, SNEHA  stands as a prime example of how NGOs can leverage data with the help of modern data tools to enhance their impact and improve the lives of underserved communities.Title: Empowering Vision Care: Project Chashma’s Transformation with Avni Platform

==================================================

Executive Summary:
Sarva Mangal Family Trust (SMFT), a non-profit organization, in collaboration with Bhansali Trust, also a non-profit organization working in healthcare, initiated Project Chashma with the ambitious goal of delivering eye care services to 20 million individuals within five years through partnerships with grassroots NGOs. However, the project encountered operational inefficiencies, especially in data management, during its initial stages, hindering its scalability and effectiveness. With the adoption of an open source data collection and case management platform,
Avni
, these challenges were addressed, leading to streamlined data management and enhanced overall operational efficiency.
The Challenges:
Bhansali Trust’s expertise in organizing eye care camps, especially for cataract surgeries across diverse Indian regions, positioned them well to lead Project Chashma. Beginning with remote villages in North Gujarat, the project aimed to deliver comprehensive eye care services, encompassing patient registration, eye examinations & consultation, eyeglass distribution, patient referrals & follow-up for eye ailment treatment, and impact monitoring. However, as the project scaled, it encountered significant operational challenges,
Crowd Management and Data Collection:
The influx of patients led to overcrowded camps, making patient registration and data collection challenging. Manual data entry, due to its slow pace and susceptibility to errors, significantly hampered the project’s ability to effectively serve the community.
Data Management:
The manual data entry process resulted in inaccuracies and inefficiencies, causing a cumbersome transition to digital records.
Process Inefficiencies:
The initial setup lacked a streamlined process for patient flow and data collection, resulting in delays and a compromised patient experience.
Reporting & Evaluation:
The absence of automated reporting delayed insights and impeded the project’s ability to adapt and enhance its operations.
Impact Assessment:
Manual processes hindered timely and precise evaluation of the project’s impact, limiting the ability to make data-driven adjustments.
Routine Follow-up:
The project required a system for ongoing patient follow-ups to ensure the sustained impact of the treatments administered.
To overcome these challenges and streamline processes, the Trust sought a digital solution tailored for remote village settings where network connectivity is limited. A customized offline mobile application was developed on the Avni platform for data collection and real-time monitoring at different stages of the process.
Implementation:
In response, the project team revamped the patient flow and data collection processes, integrating the Avni platform for its robust offline capabilities and comprehensive data management tools.
Avni
is an open-source platform for on-field service delivery and data collection. Designed for the development sector, Avni strengthens field capacity for non-profits and governments across sectors – like health, water, education, and social welfare.

==================================================

In 2018, the
Creador Foundation
was born out of a deep desire to give back to the community. Established as a trust in Malaysia by its trustees, including Shanti Kandiah, the foundation set out with a bold vision:
to empower local communities and drive sustainable, transformational change
. One of the most pressing gaps it identified was the lack of accessible, relevant financial education—especially for underserved populations in Malaysia and India.
From Malaysia to India: Building a Digital-First Education Model
The foundation’s flagship initiative, Multiply, was conceptualized as a digital-first financial education platform. By 2020, Multiply had already reached over 600,000 users in Malaysia. Encouraged by its success, Creador Foundation expanded its focus to India in 2021.
In India, Multiply specifically targets young women and micro-entrepreneurs, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns. These women often fall through the cracks of traditional financial literacy programs, which are either embedded in broader financial inclusion efforts or tied to livelihood programs—and rarely digital.
Creador’s strategy was different. Rather than relying solely on face-to-face interventions, Multiply aimed to build an ecosystem of accessible, mobile-first financial education content. This included not just basic financial concepts, but also up-to-date, practical information—like government schemes, safe investment options, and business strategies—that could actually make a difference in women’s lives and businesses.
The WhatsApp Shift: Learning from the Field
Initially, Creador experimented with a custom-built web app. But user testing and field research revealed a hard truth: people didn’t want to learn on unfamiliar platforms. They preferred to engage on platforms they were already using.
So, the team pivoted—creating engaging short-form videos and distributing them via Facebook and YouTube. These videos quickly gained traction, amassing over 800,000 users across India.
But even social media has its limits when it comes to interactivity and feedback. To bridge this gap, in 2024, the foundation began working with Project Tech4Dev and transitioned to a WhatsApp chatbot model. The chatbot allowed them to create personalized, interactive, and behavior-informed experiences—reaching over 10,000 women entrepreneurs in the first year.
The shift was transformative. Unlike the one-way communication of social media, WhatsApp enabled real-time conversations, learning, and insights. The team could ask users questions, receive direct feedback, and update content based on real challenges faced on the ground.
They also learned valuable insights about user behavior—for example, women were more likely to engage with content late at night or early in the morning, once daily chores were done. This informed how and when content was delivered.
Building for Scale and Personalization with AI
Looking ahead, Creador Foundation is setting its sights high.
Goal: Reach 300,000 to 400,000 women on WhatsApp with continuous, interactive financial learning journeys.
Next Steps: Integrate AI-driven personalization to gamify the learning experience, offer quizzes, and track progress.
Vision: Equip women not just with knowledge, but with the tools and confidence to implement these learnings in their lives and businesses.
Through its collaboration with Project Tech4Dev and platforms like Glific, Multiply is also exploring ways to measure learning outcomes directly within the WhatsApp flow, ensuring that women are not just absorbing content but actively applying it to improve their economic outcomes.
What Sets Multiply Apart
Hyper-relevant content tailored to women’s lives and financial realities.
Real-time updates on government schemes and current financial products.
Two-way learning through WhatsApp, giving voice to user needs and challenges.
A clear shift from content delivery to user-driven engagement and transformation.
“Financial education transforms not just individuals, but entire families and communities. Multiply is our way of scaling that transformation, one message, one video, one conversation at a time.”

==================================================

In a country as vast as India, access to quality education and skills development is crucial for the holistic growth and empowerment of its youth. Lend a Hand India(
LAHI
) is an organization that is tirelessly working towards bridging the educational divide and creating opportunities for young people across the country.
LAHI firmly believes that education is the foundation for a bright future. The organization is committed to providing quality education to children and youth from underprivileged backgrounds. LAHI collaborates with local schools, teachers and volunteers to create innovative teaching methods and curricula that cater to the specific needs of the communities.
Recently at Tech4Dev weve decided to work closely with some of the NGOs and understand their program really well. Lobo connected us with the LAHI team and in the last two weeks weve spent quite a bit of time on each of the program which LAHI offers. Although online meetings are great and comfortable but we decided to actually go to Pune where LAHI team operates and work closely with them to understand the programs really well. We also invited Jishnu from Goalkeep and that really helped us in terms of asking the right questions.
The agenda was really tight and to the point. Through out the day we had back to back sessions on different programs and we started with one of their older programs which is Plan 100 and we also met members who are handling those programs. Some of the takeaways for me was their the Multi Skill Foundation Course (MSFC) program which began as a pilot study in two schools in Pune in 1986 and later expanded to 100 schools as “Plan 100” with the approval of the Maharashtra government. In 2016, it was introduced in Mumbai and Pune as “Project Swadheen Maharashtra” and eventually expanded to 1,900 schools across Maharashtra. MSFC received central government approval, enabling other states to implement the subject. LAHI took the responsibility of implementing the program, covering costs and resources.
MSFC focuses on vocational education and has four skill sections.
Workshop and Enngineering techniques: Carpenting, Welding, Construction
Energy and ENv
Gardening, Nursery and Agricultural techniques
Food processing techniques, Personal Healtha and Hygiene
LAHI implements the program through two models: providing technical support to schools or directly funding and managing the program. The ultimate goal is to increase enrollment and make MSFC the preferred subject choice among students. The program emphasizes practical learning, and a well-equipped workshop is essential for implementation.The evolution and expansion of MFSC through projects like Swadheen demonstrate the commitment of LAHI in promoting vocational education and empowering students with practical skills for future success.
Karigrar Program
At the end of the sessions we visited the Karigar – School of Applied Learning, located in Pune, Maharashtra, is an initiative by Lend A Hand India (LAHI) that serves as a Skills Hub, showcasing a model for multi-skill vocational education. Drawing upon LAHI’s extensive experience, Karigar offers training in a wide range of skills including food processing, electrical appliances repairs, food preservation, baking, gardening and landscaping, auto maintenance, information technology, media and entertainment, fabrication, carpentry, and plumbing. The primary objective is to popularize and universalize skill education, emphasizing the value of “working with hands.” The facility is not only used for skill training but also serves as a Training of Trainers center, an incubator for young entrepreneurs, and an innovation lab. Karigar aims to empower individuals with practical skills, encourage entrepreneurship, and foster innovation in vocational education.
Sharing two photos from the program. LAHI has implemented a unique initiative as part of their program, featuring four mobile vans that travel across states to raise awareness about their vocational education program among children. These vans serve as mobile classrooms and interactive learning spaces, where LAHI demonstrates and provides live examples of basic skills to children. From repairing objects to fixing various items, these demonstrations bring hands-on experiences to life, captivating the children’s interest and showcasing the practical applications of vocational skills. The mobile vans play a vital role in spreading awareness, igniting curiosity, and inspiring children to explore the possibilities of vocational education.
We will be sharing more about our learnings through multiple blogs. But this visit set the stage for us to think about their data problems and for creating a solution around it. Shoutout to Lobo and Vinod for pushing us to visit the team in person and for trusting us.Title: Enhancing Superset with Custom Logic, Image Integration, and URL Parameterization

==================================================

Over the past few months, our team has been working on refining and enhancing Superset’s functionality to address unique requirements from various projects. In this post, I’ll dive into two key customizations we implemented, highlighting the challenges and solutions that made these features work.
1.
Hierarchical Filtering for A.T.E. Chandra Foundation
https://www.loom.com/share/c60718f5e0be450aae42740d686da92b?sid=cece153a-5e6f-453a-a1a4-81096725f88c
One of our most challenging projects was implementing dynamic, hierarchical filtering for A.T.E. Chandra Foundation. They needed the ability to drill down data at multiple geographic levels: state, district, taluka, village, and dam. The main challenge was building logic that could automatically adjust based on the filters selected by users.
Here’s the logic we developed:
This CASE statement determines the granularity level based on the filters applied. When a user selects a filter, the query automatically adjusts to display data at the appropriate level.
Here’s a sample query that illustrates this in action:
This solution allows for a smooth drill-down experience without overwhelming users with too much data or forcing them to constantly switch filters. The tricky part was ensuring the logic was robust enough to handle all possible cases within the limited time we had.
2.
Passing Parameters via URL for User-Specific Filtering
https://www.loom.com/share/84410c8bc1f94c6a81f9fb7aefe0905e?sid=589930c1-e000-4839-bf23-b30826476efd
Another key customization we implemented was URL-based filtering. The goal was to enable dashboards to dynamically filter data based on the user accessing the page. For this, we set up a virtual table and utilized URL parameters within the Superset query.
The query looked like this:
We were able to filter data specific to the logged-in user without needing manual intervention. This approach is particularly useful for creating user-specific dashboards with tailored data views, and the setup is relatively straightforward once the virtual table is configured.
3.
Adding Background Images in Superset
Adding images to Superset dashboards involves working directly with the CSS. First, we inspect the dashboard and use the developer tools to identify the correct CSS selectors. For example, in one instance, we targeted
.dashboard-char-id-215
to apply a background image.
The image is then added using the CSS editor within Superset:
Go to
Edit Dashboard -> Edit CSS
.
Write the necessary CSS to set the background image:
The main challenge lies in correctly identifying the CSS selectors and writing effective CSS.
4. Deploying Images to the Server
When dealing with images, it’s essential to have them hosted in a stable, accessible location. One recommended approach is to deploy these images directly to the Superset server. Here’s how we did it for A.T.E. Chandra Foundation:
This setup allows you to manage all assets for an organization in a single location, making it easier to update and deploy images.
5. How to change logo
Follow the same steps to copy the logo from your local system to the remote system.
2. Now since all configurations are already done , just change the name of your image that you uploaded to logo.png.
3. Inside the env file check for the OVERRIDE_APP_LOGO field and set it to true or 1.
4. Now do (docker compose down) and (docker compose up -d ) to restart the container.
5. Hard refresh the frontend and you can see the logo.
*Note->For Images we can use any link, but to change logo, we have to follow each and every step.
That’s it for now. We will keep experimenting this with
Superset
and all the custom things which you can do.Title: Enhancing Tech4Dev: Insights from Field Visits and Social Sector Collaborations

Summary
Another trip done, another report from the airport. Headed back home to San Francisco after a long 2 month trip in India, which was an amazing and rewarding experience, but at the same time quite exhausting. The most important aspect of this trip was I spent most of my time in conversations with NGOs and some amount of time in extended conversations with a few funders. So without further ado, some of the things that I?m taking with me and reflecting on what can be incorporated in Tech4Dev
Highlights
Spending extended time in the field with an NGO that does deep work really leaves an impression on you. I was fortunate to spend time with my daughter,
Pranjali
at
SEARCH
for 12 days, and we learned and experienced a lot. You can read about
our experiences here
and see a few of my
reports and notes here
. My wife, Mari did a trip of her own at
ATREE
and you can
read her experiences here.
I also enjoyed my impromptu trip to Meghalaya, and in addition to the beauty of the state during the rainy season, enjoyed learning more about the Northeast and the social sector scene there. You can read about the NGOs I met in
my blog post.
Suffice to say, am planning my next trip to visit the other 5 states (Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura) in the next year. We also need to think how Tech4Dev can potentially establish a presence there and help the NGO sector there in a deeper manner.
Loved spending time and learning more from our partners at
The Agency Fund
during our sprint in Bangalore. The Tech4Dev team learned quite a lot from the different NGOs in the room and our wheels are churning into how we can incorporate some of those learnings into our platforms and new products. Got lots of ideas on some tools (
Langfuse
,
LiteLLM
,
Weaviate
,
Ragas
and more) that we can integrate and host on our forthcoming AI/LLM platform and starting to work on the creation of a new experimental platform to help NGOs run learning experiments coupled with data and metrics in a seamless manner.
The happy hour that we co-hosted with The Agency Fund in Bangalore was quite a success. It was great to see so many folks from the social sector gather together and catch up with old friends and make new friends. Need to figure out how we can do more of these and encourage other folks to organize similar meetups
It’s been so nice and gratifying to see the Dalgo team come together and put on their
first sprint with
a few new NGOs. The Dalgo team has had a few struggles over the past few quarters, and all their hard work and perseverance has paid off. We still have ways to go, but things seem to be moving in unison and cohesion
Abhishek Nair kicking off the Dalgo Sprint
Also attended the first half day of the Glific Accelerator program and was quite amazed to see the team structure and execute a program with 24 NGOs. Lots of prep work and conversations before the event, and it showed. Amazed to see our growth in organizing learning programs like this accelerator.
Krishna Priya kickstarting the Glific Sprint
In addition to NGOs, I had the opportunity to have a couple of long conversations with folks from foundations. The dialogues we had with Hrishi from Azim Premji Foundation, Murugan and Vaishali from Veddis and Anand Deshpande from DeAsra / Persistent were quite informative for all of us. Am really pleased that we can have open honest conversations, where we get good feedback and their views on our work, but at the same time, we can push back and explain our reasoning. It was quite cool and impressive to listen to our team talk about and demo their platforms in our extended meeting with funders.
Thanks to the folks at Omidyar Network for opening up their office to us in Bangalore. Really enjoyed working from their offices in Bangalore, drinking multiple cups of filter coffee and having an amazing view of Bangalore. Seems like Bangalore is becoming the locus of our operations in India.
What can we do better
We need to spend more time with NGOs in the field, getting to know them better, see their programs on the field, spend time with their team and their community. My favorite parts of the trip were the conversations with the NGOs and the extended time at SEARCH in Gadchiroli. We’ve had an open offer to the team to go volunteer with NGOs, maybe we need to switch strategies and make it a requirements for everyone!
Our interactions with both the Dasra Rebuild NGOs and my visit to NGOs in Meghalaya, did highlight the fact that we are not in a position to help them today. This was also inline with our conversations with Anand Deshpande. We do have a few partners who focus on this group of NGOs, maybe we need to work with them closer and help them expand. The open question remains is to how sustainable can we make this?
Our in-person events are of incredible value to everyone involved and receive good-to-great ratings. However, from an organizational perspective, they are also very time consuming and a lot of work on multiple team members. How can we make them more efficient and less draining on the team involved.Title: Enhancing data accuracy and reliability for organizations: Leveraging Data Testing Framework
Author: Mohd Shamoon
Date: November 2023
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/enhancing-data-accuracy-for-organizations-leveraging-data-testing-frameworks/
==================================================

Introduction:
Picture this: you’re spearheading a remarkable project for your organization, employing cutting-edge technology to measure its impact. You have a dashboard showcasing the metrics that are achieved till date. However, a nagging doubt creeps in as you suspect inaccuracies within the data on the dashboard. Determined to validate the information, you engage with the creators of the dashboard, only to discover a series of complex transformations applied to the original data for getting these visuals. The transformations were applied based on the given requirements for the dashboard. Uncertainty lingers, prompting you to explore a solution: the implementation of a Data Testing Framework (DTF).
Understanding the Data Testing Framework
The primary goal of a Data Testing Framework is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of calculated data, which results from various transformations within a specific technological framework. This testing process involves cross-validating the data using a different technology to ensure consistency and integrity.’
Utilizing Google Sheets as a Differential Technology:
To carry out this validation, we leverage Google Sheets as an alternative technology. The process involves several key steps:
Dashboard Understanding:
Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dashboard, compiling a list of metrics requiring testing.
Calculation Methods:
Understand the calculation methods for each metric to identify datasets contributing to their creation.
Documentation:
Document the significance of each column in the dataset, explaining its derivation. Additionally, document the source tables of the original data and all transformations in the pipeline.
Sample Size Determination
: If dealing with a sizable dataset, determine an appropriate sample size for testing in Google Sheets.
Data Import and Transformation
: Import the sample size data from source tables and the dataset used in the dashboard into Google Sheets. Apply documented transformations using Google Sheets formulas.
Consistency Verification:
Verify the consistency of all columns between the data calculated in sheets and the data from the dashboard dataset.
Discrepancy Resolution:
Identify and rectify any discrepancies in the data, ensuring the integrity of the pipeline.
Accuracy Confirmation
: If all column data matches, it indicates that the data is accurate and reliable, having been calculated using multiple methods.
Applying DTF to Quest Alliance:
One of the challenges we are currently addressing is enhancing data accuracy for one of our esteemed
data catalyst
partners,
Quest Alliance
. Initial learnings from this endeavor include:
Data Context Awareness:
We should comprehend the context of the data, understanding what each dataset contains and its relevance to the program.
Walkthrough Analysis:
Explaining the pipeline to a different set of eyes aids in better and more reliable data. This is crucial as complex queries and a single mistake in joins or grouping can lead to incorrect data.
Cardinality Clarity:
For the dataset under testing, clarity on the cardinality of the table is paramount. Understanding how each row represents uniqueness, whether it is the user alone or the user along with details, is crucial.
Future Steps:
Over the next two months, we plan to run this framework with the Quest Alliance team, gauging its effectiveness and fine-tuning the process for optimal results. By enhancing data accuracy through DTF, we aim to empower organizations with reliable insights for informed decision-making.Title: Experiments with RapidPro FlowEditor
Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

Collecting data on Glific was one of the recurring themes of all our conversations with NGOs on their potential usage of Glific. While it is important for NGOs to realize that WhatsApp should not be used primarily as a data collection platform,  it was equally useful for us to realize that this aspect of the platform is super important for most NGOs.
It was always on our list to investigate RapidPro, specifically their flow editor, and see if we could integrate it within Glific. Based on our experiences with the Turn.io platform, we knew that RapidPro had a pretty good API we could integrate with. However, from a cost perspective, integrating TextIt (the Rapidpro commercial SaaS provider) increases the cost to the NGOs significantly. We were also keen on having the ability to define and execute “flows” as a core part of Glific.
Thanks to the amazing ecosystem of Elixir and friends, our progress on the Glific backend was going at a solid pace. We started experimenting with backend automation early on and quickly realized that we were re-doing (and potentially hard-coding) a lot of the work that we suspected was already inflows. Hence we decided to do a quick experiment with RapidPro. We were super happy to find out that the flow editor was an independent react app with a well-defined API to store the flows.
Unfortunately, there was no documentation on how to integrate the Floweditor with a different app, and we spent a couple of days understanding the code and structure of Rapidpro and how it interacts with the Floweditor. The code is very well structured and made our job a lot easier. The JSON structure that captures a flow was relatively easy to understand and integrate with our backend.
In this paragraph, each concept is linked to the corresponding elixir file, which details the fields that we are currently using. Briefly, a flow is made up of a list of nodes. Each node has a list of actions and exit points to other nodes or flow termination. Some actions have a potential router, which uses a case hierarchy to determine which of the potential exit routes to take, along with a default exit route. A flow can fire off other flows and resume when the sub-flow returns. Parsing a JSON file into the above data store was quick and easy due to the clean structure of the flow.
The main assumption that we are currently making is that each user can belong to only one flow. Starting a new flow via a trigger (still figuring out how this will integrate into Glific) results in all other flows being terminated.
Modeling the above in elixir was quite simple, using a combination of real database objects for some data types (specifically flows and revisions) and keeping the rest in memory., Executing a flow also turned out to relatively easy using elixir modules, with each data type knowing how to execute itself given a message stream.
Setup Flow Editor on frontend side
To give the flow editor as a core part of Glific we started seeing how we can integrate this in our frontend. As we said that there was no documentation for that we looked into the code to understand it. After doing some research we found that the flow editor is very nicely written and almost everything is configurable. (The things that are not today can be made configurable in the future very easily).
The flow editor package is available on npm. You need to install it by running a simple command.
npm install nyaruka/flow-editor
After installing the package you can use the FlowEditor component in your package in whatever way you want.
The FlowEditor package requires a config object as props. You need to pass all your application configuration with this config object only.
<FlowEditor config={YOUR CONFIG OBJECT} />
That’s how you can build your config object. You need to replace the base to your backend API and support all the endpoints. You can see the response format of any endpoint by calling a request on
https://floweditor.nyaruka.com/.netlify/functions/ENDPOIN
T  this endpoint. Replace ENDPOINT to with one of your endpoints.
After completion, your config object should look like this one.
Our goals for v0.2 include:
Ability to manage flows from the frontend (list, create, update and delete flows)
Integrate flow editor with our frontend app so users can create and edit their flows.
Have 5 flows shipped by default that the user can build on and customize? Those currently are:
Settings
Language
Preferences for a specific type of content
Profile Questions (Name, Age Group, Gender)
Menu
(NGO Specific options, the first few)
Optout
Help
New Contact Flow
Settings
Menu
Using flows gives Glific a lot of power and flexibility, which in turn empowers the NGO.
We thank the folks at
Nyaruka
for all the work and effort on flow editor and rapid.Title: Exploring Bhuj: Insights from Our First Field Visit and Conversations with the Community
Author: Akhilesh Negi
Date: March 2023
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/my-first-field-visit-to-bhuj/
==================================================

At the beginning of March, we got to know about a planned field visit with the
Dasra
team where well be meeting two out of the many NGOs
Dasra
funds under their Catalytic Philanthropy program. Abhishek Nair and I opted to join them on our first field visit to Bhuj, and it left a lasting impression on us as it gave us a glimpse into the lives of the people living in the small villages of Gujarat
We all arrived in Bhuj early in the morning and after checking in at the resort, we left to embark on a field visit, enthusiastic to explore and learn about the community. We split up into two smaller groups: one visiting an NGO named
Unnati
in Bacchau and the other in Nakrantha visiting
Janvikas
. I was in the latter group, with Sneha and Priyadarshika from
Dasra
.
After driving for about an hour, we arrived at our destination – a library established by the villagers which also serves as a communal space for locals. As we arrived, the villagers, including school teachers, field worker, aanganwadi caretakers, and principals, welcomed us warmly. We started our conversation with them, during which they shared how the COVID-19 pandemic had forced schools to close down. In response, some of the villagers utilized this space to teach school-aged children so that their education would not be interrupted. Recognizing the potential of this area, they converted it into a library, providing a study-friendly atmosphere for students. This really is an admirable initiative that enables children to concentrate on their studies without being distracted by household work.
Funding and books are obtained through donations from programs and annual events held here. This library has been a valuable resource for students over the past two years during the pandemic, allowing them to continue their education.
In the area, there are separate schools for boys and girls, as well as a college that offers science and arts courses, all of which are located within a 12 km radius. However, student dropouts have been a concern for the community as parents often have to relocate for work during the monsoons and take their families with them. To address this issue, villagers are planning to establish hostels that would enable children to continue their education while their parents are away. Also, the schools undergo regular checks by the Command Control Center to ensure that teachers and students are present.
After talking with individuals at the library, we proceeded to visit nearby schools. Our first stop was a two-story girls’ school, established in the mid-2000s, where more than 200 girls are currently enrolled. The school has plans to expand its facilities to accommodate more girls in the future. Following our visit to the girls’ school, we visited a boys’ school that has similar infrastructure and houses around 200 boys.
Both schools also offer midday meals six days a week and half-day classes on Saturdays. The schools were well-maintained and had Hindi and English alphabet charts made of tiles on the walls. This was a more sustainable alternative to typical paper charts that are commonly used in schools.
We then visited the hospital where we talked to doctors and the Community Health Officer(CHO) about what are the common diseases and cases that come into the hospital. They also shared that on a regular basis, they run camps where people are routinely checked using a device which tells by scanning blood sugar levels, heartbeat rate, blood oxygen level, and a few other metrics using which they can analyze the person.
They are also using an app that helps them keep track of each person’s medical records and results after each test. This data is also accessible by the monitoring team and helps in tracking the treatment given and creating a medical history of each person. The CHO also works with five asha workers with each asha worker taking care of 100 families. They also shared that people coordinate well and follow the medicine prescription and come for checkups. And during the Covid around 90% of people were vaccinated
After talking with doctors and staff members we had lunch together where we continued our discussion and got a chance to spend more time with the people.
Talking with the locals was the highlight of this visit, as I learned about their culture, how their lives are, and the challenges they faced and overcame together. The warmth and hospitality of the people made me feel welcomed and I left with a deeper appreciation for the great work everyone is doingTitle: Exploring Dalgo with SocialBytes: A Conversation on Tech-Driven Impact
Author: Deepak Nanda

==================================================

At the Chai Pe Charcha event hosted by Project Tech4Dev,
Girish NS
from SocialBytes engaged in a thought-provoking conversation with
Deepak Nanda
, emphasizing the importance of understanding organizational needs and tailoring solutions to meet grassroots challenges. With decades of experience in addressing grassroots challenges, SocialBytes discussed how tools like Dalgo can streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and foster collaboration between NGOs and technologists. Drawing from the sessions, Girish highlighted the unique challenges faced by social organizations, such as defining problem statements, aligning expectations, and scaling solutions sustainably. The discussion underscored how Dalgo’s capabilities, including automation, data visualization, and problem-solving frameworks, align with the sector’s needs, paving the way for a more efficient and impactful future.
Girish Dalgo Sprint
Deepak:
Thank you so much for joining us today. If you can, just begin by introducing yourself and SocialBytes.
Girish:
We have been working in the social sector for about 23 to 25 years. Our organization, SocialBytes, focuses on co-creating solutions for the problem statements that NGOs and other social organizations face. We work towards building an ecosystem that contributes to the larger social good, aligning with policies and creating impactful initiatives.
Deepak:
And like you talk about creating an ecosystem—that’s what you’re looking to build—and that’s where I think you are customizing your approach right now. If you could talk about that a little.
Girish:
In terms of the ecosystem we’re building, we’ve been exploring tools like Dalgo over the last couple of years. It allows us to streamline operations and reduce manual efforts. For example, we’ve been working on how Dalgo can help automate processes, align data, and improve decision-making for our clients.
What we’ve noticed is that many social sector organizations lack the clarity or capability to fully leverage their data. Often, they rely on tools like Excel, which, while useful, can only handle basic tasks. Dalgo offers a solution by reducing the time and trust issues associated with manual operations. It’s about simplifying complex processes, creating better experiences for end-users, and offering a cost-effective way to improve decision-making.
Deepak:
You mentioned that the social sector is very different from the corporate sector. Could you elaborate on the challenges you’ve identified in your work with NGOs?
Girish:
Sure. The challenges are multi-layered:
Requirement Clarity:
Many organizations struggle with understanding their requirements. This is often due to tight deadlines and project-oriented planning without centralized oversight. NGOs may start with a certain set of requirements, but these evolve over time as the project progresses.
Misalignment in Execution:
As the project unfolds, donor expectations may not align with the outcomes. Sometimes, the initial problem statement doesn’t fully capture the actual needs at the grassroots level. Often, reviews happen midway through a project, revealing gaps between what was expected and what is being delivered.
Training Gaps:
Training the trainers and grassroots teams is another major challenge. If the people implementing the solution don’t fully understand the tools or processes, it leads to inefficiencies and rework.
Organizational Changes:
Changes in program teams or leadership during a project’s lifecycle can derail progress, as new stakeholders may bring different priorities or technical understandings. For instance, a change in leadership often leads to changes in project priorities, sparking delays or realignment efforts.
These challenges are interconnected. For example, if the problem statements aren’t clear, the training may not align with the grassroots teams’ needs, leading to rework. Tools like Dalgo can address some of these challenges by providing better data visualization, actionable insights, and streamlined workflows.
Deepak:
That’s an interesting point. Many IT organizations come in as consultants with a product to sell, often without aligning with the actual needs of NGOs. How do events like Chai Pe Charcha help address this?
Girish:
Events like this are crucial because they bring stakeholders together in a collaborative space. Instead of pushing a product, these meetups focus on co-creating solutions. For example, we’ve seen organizations come to these workshops and realize that they don’t need an entirely new product but rather better integration of existing tools or even a simple dashboard.
This collaborative approach helps NGOs align their needs with what technology can realistically offer. It’s about building an ecosystem where technologists, NGOs, and other stakeholders can work together to create solutions that are scalable and sustainable.
When organizations have clarity on their needs, it eliminates a lot of the inefficiencies in projects. For instance, instead of adopting a completely new technology, they might simply need to automate a manual process or refine their data collection methods. These workshops help bridge that gap by focusing on human-centric, solution-driven approaches.
Deepak:
When we talk about products, platforms, and people, it’s clear that data plays a significant role in the social sector. What are your thoughts on the challenges and opportunities that data presents?
Girish:
Data is critical, but it’s often underutilized. Many organizations collect vast amounts of data without a clear plan for how to use it effectively. The key is to focus on actionable data. What decisions are we trying to drive? What insights do we need? Instead of gathering everything, organizations should prioritize quality over quantity.
Security is another important consideration. NGOs must ensure their data is ethically used and well-protected. They also need better training to understand what not to do with data. It’s about building a system that is sustainable, scalable, and aligned with the organization’s mission.
Most organizations need to be more thoughtful about data collection. Often, they don’t ask the right questions, leading to data that is either irrelevant or underutilized. The focus should be on collecting data that drives actionable insights and understanding the security implications of managing sensitive information.
Deepak:
That’s a valid point. Any parting thoughts?
Girish:
The social sector is unique because it operates on trust, collaboration, and shared goals. Tools like Dalgo have the potential to transform the way we work by addressing operational challenges and enabling better decision-making. But the success of these tools depends on how well they are aligned with the actual needs of the organizations.
Workshops like Chai Pe Charcha are a great step forward in fostering dialogue and collaboration. They help bring everyone to the same table, enabling us to co-create solutions that are impactful, scalable, and human-centric. The key takeaway here is that technology is a means to an end—not the end itself—and we must focus on aligning it with real-world needs for meaningful social impact.Title: Exploring Data Integration with PyAirbyte and Airbyte Connectors
Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: June 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/exploring-data-integration-with-pyairbyte-and-airbyte-connectors/
==================================================

Data integration is a crucial aspect of modern data engineering, enabling seamless data flow across various systems. I’ve had the opportunity to delve into the world of Airbyte connectors, particularly using the PyAirbyte library. In this blog, I’ll share my experience and insights gained from working with the PyAirbyte connector for Airbyte.
Getting Started with PyAirbyte
Installing PyAirbyte is straightforward. You can install it using pip:
pip install airbyte
Once installed, you can start exploring the available connectors. In my case, I wanted to integrate data from Avni, so I began by getting the source and available connectors:
import airbyte as ab
source = ab.get_source(
"source-avni",
config={"count": 5_000},
install_if_missing=True,
)
result = ab.get_available_connectors()
print(result)
This code snippet retrieves and prints a list of available connectors, showcasing Airbyte’s extensive integration capabilities.
Configuring and Reading Data
To configure the source and read data, I set up the configuration details for the Avni source. The configuration includes essential parameters like username, password, and start date.
source.set_config(
config={
"username": "api@rwb2023",
"password": "",
"start_date": "2000-10-31T01:30:00.000Z"
}
)
source.select_all_streams()
read_result = source.read()
The
source.read()
method initiates the data reading process. It fetches the data and stores it in the
read_result
variable. This method also provides detailed progress updates, making it easier to monitor the data extraction process.
Working with Extracted Data
After the data is read, I converted it to a pandas DataFrame for further analysis and manipulation.
avni_data = read_result["subjects"].to_pandas()
print(avni_data)
This DataFrame contains various fields such as
id
,
external_id
,
subject_type
,
registration_location
, and more, allowing for comprehensive data analysis.
Read Result
Incremental
I tried to run the incremental with this command and it was able to read only updated records
Insights and Learnings
Ease of Use
: The PyAirbyte library simplifies the integration process, making it accessible even for those with limited data engineering experience.
Extensive Connectors
: Airbyte offers a vast array of connectors, enabling seamless integration with numerous data sources. This flexibility is invaluable for projects requiring diverse data inputs.
Real-time Monitoring
: The library provides real-time progress updates during data extraction, enhancing transparency and control over the process.
Error Handling
: While working with the library, I encountered a few errors, such as passing incorrect arguments. The error messages were clear and helpful, aiding in quick resolution.
Few questions I’ve is
Currently it stores the data in cache when I read records from the source. So how does pyairbyte store the data in cache using duckdb
I’ve to find a way to push the data in to the postgres destination or biguqery to validate it.
I couldn’t find anything on this today.

==================================================

– This post is written by
Sudhakar
from the
Janaagraha
tech team
Innovation often starts with curiosity and a desire to solve real problems. My recent experience with
Dalgo
—a platform that helps simplify complex processes and enable smarter decision-making through its versatile tools—has been an exciting and eye-opening journey. Working on a proof of concept (POC) for city finance, especially around property tax, has taught me a lot.
Dashboard
How It Started
The idea behind this POC was simple: How can we use technology to make city finance easier to understand and manage? With Dalgo’s advanced tools and its integration with Superset, we worked on creating a solution to analyze and visualize property tax data. The goal was to help stakeholders make better decisions using clear and actionable insights.
The Journey
Understanding the Problem
: Before jumping in, we spent time learning about city finance and the issues with property tax systems. From outdated ways of collecting data to difficulties in accessing information, we found many areas that needed improvement.
Using Dalgo and Superset:
Dalgo’s AI features and its connection with Superset helped us build interactive dashboards. These dashboards turned raw data into easy-to-understand visuals, making it simple for anyone to see patterns and insights.
Step-by-Step Development
: We worked in stages, getting feedback and improving the solution at each step. This approach helped us stay on track and make the POC more useful for real-world applications.
Collaboration with Shamoon:
I had the pleasure of working with Shamoon from the Tech4Dev team on this project. His deep knowledge of handling and understanding use cases made the process much smoother. It was a great experience collaborating with someone so skilled and insightful.
Overcoming Integration Challenges:
One of the most challenging parts of the POC was integrating the Superset dashboards into the city finance portal. This integration was a core requirement, and it required close collaboration and technical expertise. With the help of Jeeva, our full-stack developer from the Janaagraha team, and Shamoon’s guidance, we were able to successfully complete the integration. Their support and problem-solving skills were crucial in overcoming this hurdle.
What I Learned
The Power of Teamwork:
Working with Shamoon and combining our ideas showed me how collaboration can lead to better results. Sharing knowledge and expertise made the POC stronger.
The Importance of Visualization:
Data becomes more meaningful when it tells a story. With tools like Superset, we could present information in a way that everyone—from officials to citizens—could understand.
Staying Flexible:
The challenges we faced during the project taught me the importance of adaptability. Feedback and quick adjustments were key to making the POC successful.
What’s Next
This POC is just the beginning. Dalgo’s potential in city finance is huge. We can explore building predictive models, and much more. There’s a lot of room to grow and make a bigger impact.
Final Thoughts
Writing about this journey has helped me reflect on the experience and appreciate the value of sharing our work. It’s not just about documenting what we did—it’s about inspiring others to innovate and make a difference. I’m excited to see where this journey takes us and look forward to hearing your thoughts!Title: Exploring Vanna.ai

offers a straightforward yet powerful concept: it enables you to chat with your SQL database. Here’s a closer look at how it works, using my test database, Glific DB, as an example.
https://videopress.com/v/VlznpFGj?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true
Vanna.ai leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to generate SQL queries. This model, trained on your dataset, works with most available vector stores and large language models (LLMs) to create and execute queries on the database, providing results instantly.
Visual Representation of the Idea
The core concept of Vanna.ai is beautifully illustrated in the diagrams they provide. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting it up and testing it.
Setting Up Vanna.ai
For my experiment, I used the following components:
ChromaDB
as the vector store
OpenAI
as the LLM
Postgres DB
(specifically, my Glific test database)
The setup process was quite straightforward. This time, I used the Jupyter Notebook extension with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which worked seamlessly.
Creating the Vanna Object
First, I created a Vanna object to store the configurations for ChromaDB and OpenAI:
class MyVanna(ChromaDB_VectorStore, OpenAI_Chat):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        ChromaDB_VectorStore.__init__(self, config=config)
        OpenAI_Chat.__init__(self, config=config)

vn = MyVanna(config={'api_key': 'key', 'model': 'gpt-4o'})
Connecting to Postgres
Next, I established a connection to my Postgres database:
vn.connect_to_postgres(
    host='localhost',
    dbname='glific_dev',
    user='mdshamoon',
    password='pass',
    port='5432'
)

df_information_schema = vn.run_sql("SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS")
Training the Model
I then created a training plan and trained the model:
plan = vn.get_training_plan_generic(df_information_schema)
vn.train(plan=plan)
This process creates embeddings in our vector store for the information schema of the Postgres table.
To view the training data, use:
training_data = vn.get_training_data()
training_data
Running Queries with Vanna.ai
The final step is to run the Flask app to start asking questions:
from vanna.flask import VannaFlaskApp
app = VannaFlaskApp(vn)
app.run()
Vanna.ai handles simple queries effectively. If a query is incorrect, you can modify it, and the feedback is incorporated for future improvements.
Conclusion
I can see Tejas really liking this as he no more needs to rely on us (so much time consuming) developers 🙂 . Vanna.ai also offers a Slack integration, and I’m considering a Discord integration if a relevant use case emerges.
Overall, Vanna.ai simplifies database interactions, making it a valuable tool for various applications.Title: Exploring foorlop.ai

==================================================

Main Offerings for normal users
forloop.ai
provides three primary services:
Web Extractor
Pipeline Editor
Web Watchdog
Web Extractor
I tested the Web Extractor on the website dalgo.in. It offers a visual selector to extract data from various elements on a webpage. After selecting the desired elements, you can export the data in CSV, Google Sheets, or other formats (with more options coming soon). You can also schedule extraction tasks to create a pipeline.
The extraction logic uses xpaths to navigate the tag hierarchy and retrieve text after the webpage loads. This method ensures accurate data extraction.
Pipeline Builder
The Pipeline Builder is incredibly comprehensive, offering a wide array of options. It appears to be an advanced version of the UI for data transformation that we used for dalgo, and with significantly more features. It is designed to handle various use cases with five main categories of nodes:
Currently, dalgo supports some data sources and cleaning nodes, while Glific supports the control and integration categories (in whatsapp context). The extensive list of options in forloop.ai is impressive.
I particularly appreciate the robust support for Google Sheets, allowing for seamless data loading and writing. Given the widespread use of Google Sheets, this feature is highly practical. For dalgo, integrating Google Sheets into the UI for transformation could be beneficial. Running a daily job to generate a Google Sheet with extracted data would streamline processes.
Web Scraping and Use Cases
The web scraping functionality is a valuable addition, enabling data extraction from a webpage, which can then be added to another database or sent via WhatsApp. An organization had asked me if we could web scrape data from recruitment sites can be sent to students on WhatsApp through Glific. This could maybe fulfill that need effectively.
AI Capabilities
The AI capabilities are available for the Enterprise users where it gives suggestions on data and pipelines so I was not able to explore that part.
In summary, forloop.ai offers a powerful suite of tools for web extraction, pipeline building, and data integration, with extensive support for Google Sheets and potential applications in various sectors.Title: Exploring the Impact of the fCxO Program: A Conversation with Antony Vivek
Author: Deepak Nanda
Date: February 2025
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/exploring-the-impact-of-the-fcxo-program-a-conversation-with-antony-vivek/
==================================================

Tech solutions often fail NGOs. Why? Because most tech companies design solutions remotely, without understanding on-ground realities. In a conversation with Antony Vivek, an entrepreneur-turned-social-impact-leader, we explore how fCxO is bridging this gap. Antony Vivek shares how fCxO bridges the gap between NGOs and effective tech adoption—helping organizations move from chaos to structured solutions. He dives into real-world case studies, from education in Rajasthan to tribal healthcare AI projects.
Deepak:
Antony, thanks for joining us today! Let’s start with your journey. What were you doing before joining the fCxO program at Project Tech4Dev, and how did you end up here?
Antony:
I’ve always had an entrepreneurial mindset. Straight out of college, I started my own firm—17 years ago now! Back then, we noticed that while India had a massive IT workforce, most products were being developed for companies in other countries. This idea stuck with me, and I wanted to build an
India-first tech product
that could later scale globally.
Through my career, I worked mostly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, helping businesses navigate
chaotic, unstructured environments
and bringing
order to the madness
. Over time, I got deeply involved in the social impact space—partly because my wife works in the sector. I was always supporting her work from the sidelines.
When COVID hit, I saw it as a turning point. I moved into impact consulting, where I realized a
huge gap
—consulting firms were advising NGOs on the need for tech, but
not actually helping them implement it
. Many organizations simply didn’t have the resources or expertise to execute these strategies.
That’s when I came across
Project Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO (fCxO) Program
—offering
part-time, senior tech leadership for NGOs
. It was exactly the
hands-on, problem-solving approach
I believed in. So, I joined the program, and the rest is history!
Deepak:
That’s an incredible journey. Given your experience working with startups, how do you compare the challenges faced by
NGOs
versus
corporate businesses
?
Antony:
In many ways, NGOs have it
tougher than startups
. They operate with:
Limited budgets
Small teams
Tight timelines
Huge expectations to create impact at scale
Another similarity is how
NGOs and startups both reverse-engineer solutions
. In the corporate world, products are often built for
top-tier cities first
and then adapted for smaller towns. But NGOs take the
opposite
approach—
designing frugal, scalable solutions
for underserved communities and then
scaling them up
.
A key challenge is
bringing structure to the chaos
. NGOs are juggling
donor expectations, community needs, and internal operations
, all while trying to drive impact. That’s where a
tech intervention
—even something as simple as
automating processes
—can make a huge difference.
Deepak:
Can you share an example of an NGO you’ve worked with and how tech helped them?
Antony:
Absolutely. One experience that stuck with me was working with an NGO in Rajasthan focused on
getting out-of-school girls back into education
.
From a consulting perspective, we initially thought:
1️⃣ The best way to support them was through
volunteer teachers
2️⃣ These volunteers should have
a B.Ed degree
(education qualification)
But when I visited the field, I met
a local community leader—a physically challenged man—who was the real changemaker
. He was personally convincing families to send their daughters to school,
organizing transport, negotiating with families, and ensuring safety
.
I realized that
our assumption about needing B.Ed-qualified teachers was flawed
. The real challenge was
mobilizing local community leaders
—not finding formally trained educators. We pivoted the strategy to
recruit passionate volunteers rather than just focusing on credentials
. This drastically
expanded the talent pool
and
boosted program impact
.
The key takeaway?
You need to be on the ground to truly understand problems before implementing tech solutions.
Deepak:
That’s a powerful insight. Now, you’re working with
SEARCH
, an NGO focused on
tribal healthcare
. What has your experience been like?
Antony:
SEARCH operates in deeply
rural, tribal areas
with very
limited access to healthcare
. They wanted to explore
AI for mental health support
—but they were still using
archaic software from the early 2000s!
Their challenge was
jumping from outdated tech straight to AI
without the
right infrastructure
in place. As an fCxO, my role was to
help them take a more structured approach
.
One of our quick wins was implementing
Glific
, a WhatsApp-based chatbot solution. Within
five days
, we had a functional chatbot supporting their mental health initiative. They were blown away—it showed them that
tech is accessible and scalable when approached strategically
.
This experience reaffirmed what I believe:
✅ NGOs need
structured guidance
in selecting and implementing the right tech
✅ They need to focus on
real challenges
, not just chase trends like AI
✅
Hands-on, field-driven tech adoption
is what truly works
Deepak:
That’s amazing. Unlike traditional consultants,
fCxOs work closely with NGOs over months
. How does this model make a difference?
Antony:
Consultants often work in
short bursts
—they analyze, create reports, and move on. But NGOs need
sustained support
to navigate the
messiness of tech adoption
.
I see
fCxOs as a guiding force
—like a
parent
helping a child in a candy store. NGOs often
get excited about every tech solution
but need someone to help them
prioritize what’s actually useful
. We don’t just
recommend
solutions—we
implement them alongside the team
.
This hands-on approach is what makes fCxO different. It’s about:
1️⃣
Helping NGOs define their real tech needs
2️⃣
Guiding them through implementation—step by step
3️⃣
Ensuring long-term sustainability, even after we leave
Deepak:
What’s next for fCxO? How do you see the program evolving?
Antony:
There’s
huge potential
to scale the
fCxO model
across more NGOs. Right now, many NGOs:
🔹 Know they need
tech support
but don’t know
where to start
🔹 Struggle with
finding the right vendors and tools
🔹 Need help in
defining their tech roadmap
At the recent
fCxO Sprint
, we worked with an NGO facing
major data challenges
. In just
a week
, we built a structured approach that
transformed how they manage data
.
The future of fCxO is:
✅
Expanding access
to more NGOs
✅
Building a network of tech leaders
passionate about social impact
✅
Creating a lasting impact by embedding tech into nonprofit operations
I personally hope to
work with 10+ NGOs in my lifetime
—because every NGO we empower
amplifies impact for thousands of beneficiaries
.
Deepak:
That’s inspiring. It’s clear that your journey—from tech entrepreneur to social impact leader—has reshaped your
definition of success
.
Antony:
Absolutely. Earlier, success was about
scaling businesses
. Now, it’s about
scaling impact
.
At
SEARCH
, I saw a powerful example of this:
💡 Twice a week, the entire team—from leadership to field staff—cleans the campus together at 6 AM. No one is
forced
to do it—it’s about
shared ownership and responsibility
.
That’s what I want to bring into my work—
helping NGOs build sustainable, tech-enabled ecosystems
that
outlast individual contributions
.
Deepak:
That’s a beautiful perspective. Thank you, Antony, for sharing your journey and insights. Looking forward to seeing fCxO grow and transform more NGOs!
Antony:
Thanks, Deepak! It’s been great reflecting on this journey and what lies ahead.

==================================================

We at
Tech4Dev
are all open source and promotes same, that means all our work is open source which includes our products
Glific
,
Dalgo
and
AVNI
as well. We’re always thrilled about FOSS India the annual celebration of free and open-source software, hosted by the dedicated FOSS United community. This year’s event, which came right after our Kochi sprint, was especially exciting as we geared up to join the third edition in Bangalore.
Read more about our past FOSS experience here
My India FOSS Experience
First Talk at India FOSS
It started somewhere early September, 2023 when we submitted 5 talks from
Tech4Dev
. The one I submitted was about our recent C4GT experience, and journey from code to community and how an organization can foster community of new contributors
On the day when results were announced they shared that they received nearly 180 proposals for talks and had only enough time to schedule about 48-50 talks. We were bit disappointed but later on got invite to be on the panelist on FOSS for Social Good along with other OASIS partners. Read more about
OASIS
and why it is important for social sector
here
Day 1 at FOSS
The FOSS opening ceremony kicked off at 9:30, but we were so amped up that we got there by 8:30. We grabbed some breakfast and set up our booth. We chatted with folks who stopped by, telling them all about Tech4dev and our various projects and initiatives
At our stall, we primarily showcased
Glific
,
Dalgo
,
FCXO
and
AVNI
. It was awesome to connect with people who shared our passion for tech and the community.
There were many other stalls but two which caught my attention were:
Bruno
: It is a fast and open-source API client that challenges tools like Postman and Insomnia. It stores API collections on ones computer in a plain text format, allowing collaboration through version control systems like Git.
Newrelic
: It is an observability tool that provide data for engineers to monitor, debug, and improve their entire stack.
Apart from other community partners, we also had students coming up to us all pumped about our platforms. They were eager to know how they could contribute and how they can start their journey in development. Since we’re already looking for new developers for our project, it was a perfect fit. We put up a “We’re Hiring” sign, and that got us even more attention.
If you’re feeling the same way and want to jump in, send us your resumes at
resumes@projecttech4dev.org
We then wrapped up Day 1 at 4:30, and excited for Day 2!
Day 2 at FOSS
The first half of Day 2 we spent at our booth, and we had a cute additiona poster made by Rohit’s son that said, “We’re Hiring.”
Similar to day before we had quite a traction, where people from different people reached out and want to know about Tech4Dev and various products/initiatives
In the second half, we had a panel discussion about FOSS in the social sector.
It was a real honor to be on this panel with some industry leaders like Ramya Sundarajan from
Welive Foundation
, Venay Venu from
Samanvay Foundation
and Akhila Somnath from the
Tech4Good Community
. Each of us brought our own perspective from different fields, but we all shared the common goal of exploring how tech and FOSS can help the social sector.
A big shoutout to Shemeer Babu for being an awesome moderator.
I felt pretty good about how the discussion went overall. We covered a wide spectrum, starting with the perspective of NGOs around tech presented by Ramya, then delving into how tech has made a difference and why it’s essential, as shared by Akhila and at last shared nitty-gritty from a developer’s point of view, with Vinay and me.
I hope the audience got something valuable from our chat, and I’m looking forward to seeing more folks get involved.
I’m grateful to FOSS for giving me this opportunity, and excited about future chances to showcase the work we’re doing at
Tech4dev
or share our two cents in more panel discussions.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: March 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/fast-cycle-monitoring-using-machine-learning-on-user-voicemails/
==================================================

This post was written by Sindhuja Jeyabal and appeared on the
Dost Blog
. It seemed relevant to our community and hence reposting here.
Dost supports parents of any literacy level to unlock their child’s full potential. We use simple accessible technology already in the hands of the parents to nudge and motivate them to adopt quality education practices at home. Our main product, “
Phonecasts
” – supports parents through daily 1 minute phone calls that share activities they can do right at home to get their child school ready.
We follow rapid iteration and a data-driven approach in our product development process; we incorporate user feedback through conducting focus groups to co-create our content and monthly user conversations to collect feedback on product features. We wanted to extend the same approach to monitor and evaluate our impact. This is when we came across
Acumen’s Lean Data Field Guide
which emphasizes efficiency and rapid response in data collection while still achieving a sufficient degree of rigor. The overlap in the approaches made a compelling case for us to design a rapid-cycle monitoring system
Lean Data Monitoring Design
Our monitoring goal was to understand if our users like the school readiness practices we recommend, if they adopt them at home and if they see an impact on their child. Since our core product is phone call based, IVR (Interactive Voice Response) touch tone responses were our natural choice to collect this information. But as the Acumen guide points out, IVR is not suited for getting qualitative data – data that is crucial to explain why something is happening. To overcome this issue, we used
Exotel’s in-built voicemail prompt feature
to help users record their message on the phone call. Since we started this process in Oct 2019, users have recorded 890 voicemails across the 3 different question areas mentioned above! This is a treasure trove of data but the immediate bottleneck for our small team was to get insights from it – manually going through the voicemails did not scale 🙁 This is when we worked with an
Insight Data Science
Fellow who used machine learning to cut down the manual work and get insights faster.
Using machine learning to get user insights
While recording feedback via audio was easier for most of our users and the quality of information was higher, many users were not familiar with the feature; leading to 65% of recorded voicemails being invalid – either silence or background voices. We used machine learning to automate the process of identifying valid voicemails and automatically transcribing them.
Machine learning on user voicemails reduced our manual workload to identify insights by 75%
The technical details
We built a 5 step machine learning pipeline to identify if a voicemail is valid and transcribe it. We started with 400 manually labeled voicemails to train our models. Read ahead if you are interested to know how we built the pipeline:
1. Voice selection:
This step trims out the dead time/silence at the beginning and end of the audio using Python’s
pydub
library. Doing this helped the program to directly focus on where people were speaking directly into the phone while also filtering out a majority of the “silent” voicemails.
2. Auto validity identification:
This is a classification model that identifies a voicemail as valid or invalid with the help of
MFCC audio
features extracted from the audio using the
librosa
python library. These features allowed the program to separate someone speaking directly into the phone from the remaining background noise/voices that were above the silence cut. This model has an 86% recall value.
3. Auto gender identification:
This is again a classification model that uses the audio features generated using librosa to identify the gender of the speaker, useful for us to understand a basic profile of the speaker. The defining feature for this model was to break the audio into pitch-frequency space with the male voice being concentrated at lower frequencies and the female voice spanning to higher frequencies. This model has an 81% accuracy.
Dost?s voicemail processing pipeline
4. Quality check:
While the goal is to automatically transcribe all the audio, because of the low quality of the voicemails most state-of-the art speech APIs did not work for us. So we added an extra step to only transcribe voicemails that were above a certain quality threshold. The threshold that worked for us were voicemails that were identified as valid by our model with more than 80% confidence.
5. Transcription:
We used Google Cloud?s Speech API to transcribe high quality voicemails.
Input a voicemail audio, this pipeline returns an output in the following format: {valid_tag: ‘valid’, valid_score: ’95’, gender_tag: ‘female’, ?speech_start?: 5s, ?speech_end?: 25s}. With the pipeline saving 75% of our time, the speech_start and speech_end features are especially huge time savers for the remaining manual processing since they help us seek to the exact point in the audio where the user starts speaking.
The code is available under MIT license on
github

Takeaways
Through working on this project, we have identified a scalable method for us to stay in touch with our users and continually assess the value we provide. We are now adding more options for users to provide feedback to improve the product further. We thank

==================================================

Date of field visit: May 27-28, 2025 | Districts visited: Mahendragarh, Rewari, Faridabad
🗺️
As part of the Haryana State Rural Livelihoods Mission (HSRLM), we launched the Kunji bot to provide district officials, block coordinators, and Self-Help Group (SHG) members with WhatsApp-based access to key policies and processes. Our objective for the field visit was to understand user interaction patterns, to gather feedback on current functionality, and identify opportunities to improve user centricity and adoption.
Our discussion with Radhe Radhe SHG group led by Sushma ji in Rewari district, Haryana
User demographics and digital readiness
We met a diverse range of stakeholders, including program coordinators, district officials, and SHG members. Key findings on digital readiness include:
Device ownership:
Approximately 85-90% of SHG women use android smartphones
Literacy:
Most users demonstrated functional Hindi reading capabilities
Connectivity challenges:
Network issues persist in remote villages
Digital familiarity:
Varied levels of smartphone proficiency was seen across user groups
User Perception and Interaction
🟢
Users perceive Kunji as a “
female guidebook
“—
a trusted companion with answers to all their questions
. For district and block officials, the bot is especially relevant and useful since it offers quick, accessible information during meetings or field visits. The concise responses are key, as users often struggle to navigate through lengthy policy documents.
Critical pain points
🔴
Response reliability:
Inconsistent answers caused by overlapping or outdated policy documents.
Poor response to short forms in queries:
Limited support for common abbreviations Eg: RF – Revolving Fund
Formal language:
Administrative Hindi language makes the response difficult to understand for SHG members
Response format:
Text-heavy responses lacking visual or multimedia elements make it difficult to read through
Long policy documents attached as links
: The policy documents attached along with the response are in English and some of them run into many pages. These are not useful and are never opened by SHG members.
Our meeting with District Program Manager, Aftab Ahmad ji, Rewari district
User requirements and preferences
Content format
Short video explanations similar to YouTube shorts for complex processes
Conversational Hindi in place of formal administrative language
Visual aids and step-by-step guidance format followed in responses
Interactive design
Proactive communication including greetings and policy updates initiated by the bot
Technical errors faced at the location sharing step during registration process needs to be simplified
Trust and credibility
Government branding and official attribution to the responses sent by Kunji bot will add to the credibility of responses
Adding a government logo, description and a verified HSRLM website will make the bot look official and increase trust amongst users
Strategic insights from the field
💡
Content Optimization
We need to start sending nudges to users through Kunji bot for important days, occasions to build salience
A regular content vetting process through which revised policy documents can be updated, needs to be set in place
Technical Reliability
Response consistency and speed needs to be improved
Voice note functionality needs to be improved
Details about common abbreviations needs to be updated
Meeting with NARI Shakti Nirman SHG group, led by book keeper Bhawna Sharma ji, in Faridabad district
Conclusion
💫
The Kunji bot demonstrates significant potential for democratizing access to government services through AI-powered WhatsApp interactions. However, realizing this potential requires addressing fundamental issues related to technical reliability, content accessibility, and user experience design.
The field visit was an amazing experience since it helped me connect with the users, see the environment in which they work and understand their perspective on the product. Something that one would never get through multiple meetings or brainstorming sessions. Watching their eyes light up at features we’ve built, and noticing where they struggle, gave us invaluable insights into what’s working well and where we need to improve.✨Title: Final Sprint Report to Community

This was an email sent to the larger tech4dev community. Recording it as a blog post for archival purposes.
For those in the US, we hope you had a restful and relaxing Thanksgiving weekend with friends and family. I’m super thankful to all our funders and partners for giving us the freedom and flexibility to do what we think might work and be beneficial to the sector. You’ll truly rock and the world needs more funders like you 🙂 Also grateful to have a partner like
Colored Cow
who went above and beyond to make this event a reality.
We just wrapped up the Tech4Dev Tehri sprint with a group of 35 folks across 9 organizations from 4 countries involved in the social sector space in India. The in-person event was our first after two years with the main goals being:
Bring the community together at a great location – relax, chat and have a fun time
Learn from each other and get more exposure on what other organizations are working on and why
Few scheduled activities – give people ample space and time to do their own work and have conversations as needed
Introductions and getting started
We succeeded in achieving what we set out to do and are quite pleased with the results. In general there is a certain nervousness as you plan such things, wondering if it will even work. It was great to see that it worked beyond our wildest expectations.
All the participating organizations
blogged about their experience or some specific day.

Onwards and upwardsTitle: First two days in Kenya Sprint
Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: February 2024
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/first-two-days-in-kenya-sprint/
==================================================

We’re having our first sprint outside of India and we’ve come to one of the best sprint locations so far and really want to appreciate the everyone who’s involved for doing this. I was very excited about this sprint because I was getting a chance to meet more people outside of India and was a little worried about the long hours flights which I had to take but I made it and it was totally worth it.
Day 1 Morning
We reached around 5:30 am in the morning and after some time we left for Naivasha where our sprint location was. On the way, we stopped for a wonderful view from Rift Valley and we also did a little shopping from there then we went to some old church which was along the way.
Then we reached around 10 am at the Sawela Lodges and after having breakfast we rested for 1 hour and we went to see local sightseeing which was just opposite to the resort. We saw some giraffes very closely which was a great experience and a local guide was needed for this one because of some 5k hippos in the lake so it was quite dangerous as well.
After coming from there Me, KP and vinod sat together to discuss vinod’s early starting days experience in US and in India. We also discussed some stock market investments which we all do mainly because we found some common interests amongst us.
Evening Get Together
After this we had a small get together with everyone at the lodge and by this time people from Agency Fund, Noora Health and some other NGOs had joined us. I started talking to linus from agency fund about how I met him (bec of paper survey connector) and he started telling me that he’s using paper survey connector for Shamiri use case around mental health and then we started talking about what Shamiri do and how they have a problem on ground with collecting some of the data. We also talked about the roadmap for Dalgo and He was interested to know if AI is on the roadmap. I know it’s a buzz word amongst the ngo’s and we’re trying to find some good use cases to work one also if generalizing it would be nice. I also met some of the agency fund people who I know from previous sprint but it is always good to see them but we miss Rob. Hope to see him soon. That’s if from the day. After a tiring day we slept like really early also.
Day 2
We started early on the second day. Best highlight was lobo didn’t go for a morning walk. I was hoping to tease him throughout the day but then he surprised me with 6k steps in the afternoon only.
So we started early on the second day and by 8:30 AM most of the people were already in the conference room. Agency people started with a little introductory session with everyone and right after that we had a small game where we needed to talk to any two or new people within a few minutes. So I got a chance to talk to Natacha Mugeni from V
labs
and they’re working with youth to design a healthier, more prosperous future for themselves. They’re working in around 18 countries and have worked with more than 12k children’s. This was wonderful to hear. The second time I had a chance to talk to Anubhav from Noora health. We had online communication when the agency fund connected with us last year. He wanted to know what we’re doing with Dalgo and I kind of explained to him what we did with our last few poc’s. I will be talking to him soon in detail.
Then we had our first session right after that and Digital Green was presenting and we had one more lightning talk by Noora health after that. Then Agency Fund created this segment where people had to divide in the group and we needed to brainstorm together on the topic of
Solution to give voice to program participants/two-way communication with program participants

After that we followed up with a few more lightning sessions by Educate, Jacaranda health, kabakoo. Pretty much day 2 was focused on more collaboration sessions and NGO’s talk.Title: Flushing Out Inefficiencies: SHRI & Dalgo’s Data-Driven Approach to Deliver High Quality Sanitation Services
Author: Siddhant Singh

==================================================

Access to clean and safe sanitation remains a pressing challenge for marginalized communities in India where private toilets are infeasible due to space constraints and lack of piped sewer networks often engendering open defecation. To combat this, India’s government has provisioned over 600,000 shared sanitation facilities since 2014, but the general lack of guidelines on their maintenance and regular cleaning often renders facilities unusable. Sanitation and Health Rights in India (SHRI) addresses this issue and furthers India’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), by installing and operating professionalized and community led operating and maintenance (O&M) systems at these government-built facilities. This approach ensures high facility quality, a crucial factor in maintaining consistent usage, benefiting over 7,000 daily users across 20 facilities in four districts in Bihar and Jharkhand, India.
However, tracking facility performance, cleanliness, and maintenance at scale was a significant challenge. Dalgo’s integration transformed SHRI’s ability to collect, analyze, and act on real-time data, leading to improved service delivery, accountability, and scalability.
SHRI’s Data Needs
SHRI required a robust system to track sanitation facility usage and generate actionable insights for timely intervention. To achieve this, they developed standard operating procedures, integrated technology, and trained local staff members to manage and utilize this system effectively.
Data is used to:
Track and resolve issues occurring at facilities
Get real-time information on staff attendance to ensure accountability and high-quality service delivery
Track sanitation usage patterns to optimize resource allocation
Generate reports for government, academic, and funding partners to drive policy change
Challenges in Data Use
Despite having robust sanitation infrastructure, SHRI faced significant data-related inefficiencies:
Manual Data Processing
: The manual data cleaning, transformation, and upload/sharing process took up 20-25 hours per week of a dedicated full-time resource, and was prone to a high risk of errors.
Versioning & Documentation Gaps
: Lack of structured documentation and version control made it difficult to understand and roll back changes, collaborate with others, and retain knowledge through changes in staffing.
Slow Dashboard Performance
: Google Data Studio dashboards were pulling data directly from Google Sheets instead of a structured database. They faced long loading times,
Scalability Concerns
: The manual nature of data management made it dependent on human resources and limited SHRI’s ability to expand operations seamlessly.
These challenges led to reduced operational efficiency, delays in decision-making, and difficulties in tracking sanitation usage trends at scale.
Dalgo’s Intervention
SHRI partnered with Dalgo to automate data processing and visualization, revolutionizing how data was managed and utilized and enabling them to scale with ease. Within three months, Dalgo implemented a system that:
Automated Data Processing
: Eliminated manual intervention by creating a seamless flow from Kobo forms to analysis dashboards.
Enhanced Data Accessibility
: Provided real-time insights to all stakeholders; field teams, monitoring units, and leadership.
Optimized Dashboard Performance
: Improved data storage and retrieval, bringing dashboard response time down to a second.
Established Scalability & Documentation
: Implemented structured version control, ensuring future updates and expansion could be managed efficiently.
Impact on SHRI’s Operations
The adoption of Dalgo significantly improved operations, access, insights and transparency across different levels of the organisation:
Field Team
Simplified reporting and reduced manual errors, improving efficiency.
Real-time insights enabled proactive maintenance and better facility management.
“SHRI’s digital tracking systems have made my work productive and error-free compared to manual registers.”
–
SHRI Field Worker
Data Team
Eliminated time-consuming manual aggregation and now focus on review and insights.
Improved the ability to track trends and measure impact efficiently.
Enabled SHRI to sustain operations with a lean data/tech team.
Facility staff review the reports everyday and reach out to the Dalgo team when support is needed.
Leadership & Funders
Enabled data-backed decision-making to optimize resource allocation.
Increased trust and accountability through transparent, real-time impact reporting.
“Dalgo transformed our ability to track and improve sanitation services.
With real-time insights, we’ve enhanced facility maintenance, user experience, and data-driven advocacy for better sanitation policies.”
– SHRI Leadership
Program Outcomes
99% Facility Uptime
: Ensured continuous access to clean sanitation.
Sustainable Operations
: SHRI maintains facility operations at less than ₹3.06 ($0.04) per use.
Data-Driven Advocacy
: Strengthened engagement with government and CSR funders by demonstrating measurable impact.
Increased Efficiency
: Freed up resources by eliminating manual data handling, allowing teams to focus on higher-value tasks.

Way Forward
By leveraging Dalgo’s expertise in data automation, SHRI has transformed its operational efficiency, improved decision-making, and scaled its impact. This case study exemplifies how technology-driven solutions can empower sanitation organizations to create lasting social change.
In the coming years, SHRI plans to:
Expand deployment to ~15 more facilities in Jharkhand in 2025
Expand SHRI’s current community sanitation facility (CSF) model in 400+ government schools in 2025/26.
Integrate predictive analytics for proactive maintenance.
Advocate for
government-wide adoption
of data-driven sanitation monitoring.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: November 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/formik-as-gold-standard-to-create-forms-in-react/
==================================================

React
is one of the most popular frontend frameworks that powers millions of websites. It has a great open source community and numerous packages that make frontend development extremely easy. In this blog, I’ll cover a peculiar aspect of React that is still difficult for developers. It is building
forms
. . The most challenging part about it is managing the state, validation, showing error messages
There are many
React Form libraries
which make coding
forms
easy. Some of the widely used ones are
formik, react-hook-form, redux-form
and
react-final-form
. The most popular among them is
Formik
, in fact, it is recommended by the React Community.
On FundImpact platform, we have deployed
Formik
to create Forms and ensured we spend less time in reinventing the wheel. The great thing about
Formik
is that it is very easy to use. The motto of
Formik
is “React forms without the tears!” and I think it has done a great job in achieving that.
Formiks
clean API lets us use it without worrying about a lot of state management.
Regarding Validations, we can use any 3rd party library. I would recommend
Yup
for object schema validation.
Yup
is one the best validation libraries and
Formik
gives us out of the box support for
Yup
validations which makes it more programmer friendly.
Formik gives us various kinds of props and we can pass these props to our form elements to manage validation and submissions.
We can pass initial values of the input elements, validation function, onSubmit function to Formik.
How to Install
In order to install formik we can use the following commands
npm install formik –save
or
yarn add formik
Import formik to your project
In order to import formik do this
import { Formik } from “formik”;
We pass initial values to F
ormik
and it will modify the values automatically with the help of the
onChange
function. We also pass validation function as props. The validation function will receive the values of the form as parameter and it will return an error object which will help us to show error messages.
The validation function looks like the following:-
Formik component will look like this
On every keystroke validation function would be called and errors object will contain all validation errors at any given moment.In our component, we are just checking if an error exists and then immediately showing it to the user. Most of the time, we only want to show a field’s error message after our user is done typing in that field.Like values and errors formik keep track of the fields that have been visited and it does that with the help of touched object. We can use the touched object to solve this problem.
Final thoughts
Formik provides very optimized state management which reduces performance issues, its very easy to build dynamic forms with Formik. Stay tuned for more updates on this blog for tips and tricks on using Formik libary.

Author: Antony Justin
Date: February 2025
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/fractional-cxo-at-search-gadchiroli/
==================================================

Overview:
“As we work to create light for others, we naturally light our own way.”
is one of the best ways for me to introduce this blog which is about my experience of helping an NGO in strengthening and improving their operations.
Organisation Background:
The
Society for Education, Action, and Research in Community Health (SEARCH)
is a non-governmental organization established in 1986 by Drs. Abhay and Rani Bang in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra, India. Guided by Gandhian principles, SEARCH aims to achieve “Arogya Swaraj,” or “People’s Health in People’s Hands,” by empowering communities to manage their own health and attain freedom from disease and dependence.
SEARCH
has achieved significant milestones since its inception in 1986 especially in the areas of Home based Neonatal care, Alcohol and Tobacco de Addiction and several tribal health programs. SEARCH also runs a tribal hospital catering to both tribal and non-tribal populations of Gadchiroli. SEARCH runs various initiatives towards identifying and nurturing young individuals committed to social change as part of their NIRMAN initiative.
Through rigorous community-based research, SEARCH has published numerous studies influencing health policies at state, national, and global levels. Their work has provided evidence-based solutions to pressing health challenges in marginalized communities.
Life at Shodgram
SEARCH is an organisation that is steeped in Gandhian principles and it is an understatement to say that the words of Gandhiji
“live simply so that others might simply live”
resonate in each and every nook and corner of “Shodgram” (name of the SEARCH campus).
The first thing that hit me during my time at SEARCH was how facile it is to lead a simple life and how ridiculously easy it was to take care of your environment when there is collective will to do so.
It has been a pleasure to participate in their biweekly campus cleaning activities of cutting foliage and weeds that are converted into compost that is used for the plantations and gardens inside the campus. Having been asked not to venture out of campus for my early morning or late evening jogs owing to the presence of tigers in the vicinity, I ended up walking all around the campus with my new “besties”, Alpha, Beta, Gollu and Chumki!
Objectives of the FCxO Engagement
True to their nature of being pioneers in community health research, SEARCH had identified the potential of the transformation that could be brought into the scope and scale of community healthcare and empowerment using AI. However, considering the challenges of their operating environment as well as the legacy systems currently in place, SEARCH decided to collaborate with Project Tech4Dev to bring in the necessary technical expertise and experience necessary to orchestrate the introduction of AI within the research and programs of SEARCH through the FCxO program, thus beginning my journey of working with SEARCH.
The collaboration codenamed “AI Saksham” aims at enabling SEARCH in their mission of transitioning from hospital based health care to Arogya Swaraj through community level engagement.
Clarity of outcomes
With an emerging field that is evolving at such a rapid pace as AI, it is very plausible that focus gets diluted across multiple experiments and it is the job of the FCxO to create the necessary segregations and classifications of the use cases so as to set expectations in the best possible manner. It was proposed that the AI interventions be segregated into two buckets; Operations and Knowledge.
This was necessary to establish clarity across the organisation as to the initiatives that were aimed at improving efficiency/increasing scale and those that were aimed at improving the quality of the research, data and ultimately knowledge within the organisation that can then be channeled back into the programs and research.
The interventions selected were bracketed under these two broad umbrellas to ensure fair amount of focus being given to both efficiency and learning.
Theory of change
The project is a fascinating experiment of trying to revolutionise program delivery and research using cutting edge technologies while upgrading legacy systems in tandem while ensuring uninterrupted delivery of services.
It is very important, at such junctures, for the FCxO to understand existing processes and infrastructure (read tech tools, servers etc) and to weave an upgradation roadmap that is both necessary and catalytic to the big bets envisioned by the organisation.
Existing infrastructure and processes were reviewed in detail to understand the objectives of the respective processes. For each of the processes reviewed, upgradation ideas (wherever necessary) were formulated that would be beneficial both to the program in isolation but also to the progress towards the eventual tech ecosystem as envisioned by the NGO.
Powered with an understanding of the current setup which includes a tech assessment of the existing tech landscape and clarity about the big bets that the organisation is looking towards, a theory of change was proposed that presented the future state of the tech ecosystem and a visualisation of how this was necessary to achieve the end state which in this case was using AI for both operational efficiency as well as better research and predictions.
The onus is on the FCxO to take a birds eye view of the entire organisation and be able to visualise and present the extent of the impact of the proposed changes across the organisation. The FCxO is to ensure that the proposed changes address digitisation, modernisation as well as be able to champion process changes wherever necessary to reduce redundancy as well as wastage of human resources.
“Saksham” (empowerment) and not replacement is to be ensured so as to make the changes be executed in a manner where  it not only replaces older systems but also empowers and enables the existing teams to operate these tools better and make better use of their time.
Roadmaps and the “Divide and conquer” mantra
Having driven alignment with the organisation leadership on the broad spectrum of changes required to achieve desirable state, focus shifts now to creation of breaking down of the overall plan into smaller deliverables that are then used to draw up project plans and timelines based on the relations and interdependencies among these smaller blocks.
Each of these plans are planned to be executed in an “agile” manner so as to shorten the timelines of incorporating feedback and learnings into future iterations.
Low hanging fruits are being chosen that can act as a primer for related activities and are being addressed so as to provide early feedback both the success of the pilots but also about the capability of the teams to adapt and evolve.
The aim is to gradually build robust and scalable foundations for the entire tech ecosystem but also ensure identification and experimentation on use cases on the ground to drive alignment to latest trends and advances, especially in the AI space.
I look forward to future blogs where I will record more progress, wins and learnings from this exciting initiative.
Personal reflections on being a FCxO
One of the best benefits of being a FCxO is the opportunity to be as close to the ground as possible with people who are committed to bring about social change and make a difference in the lives of the common people.
Personally I found it very inspiring to understand their personal motivations that make them do what they do and this makes the process of enabling and empowering them a deeply satisfying and humbling experience.
I now look forward to as many more engagements as possible for more learning, collaboration and meaningful contributions.
And I now am able to truly understand Roy.T. Bennett when he said that

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: September 2022
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/fractional-cxo-program-from-tech4dev-for-your-technology-strategy-data-and-technology-needs/
==================================================

Tech4Dev runs a technology, data and tech strategy assistance program called the Fractional CxO program. This program assists NGOs with a combination of their technology strategy, technology/data needs by placing a seasoned technology professional at the NGO for 3 – 9 months.
How it works
You fill out a form giving details of your organizations technology/data needs, vision and plans.
We evaluate your needs, vision and plans and choose a few NGOs to work with that meet our criteria
We assign a seasoned technology professional to work with you. This person is embedded at the NGO and spends 10 – 20 hours a week working with NGO executives to
Define technology and data strategy if needed
Whet the technology and data vision and help identify tactical elements such as software partners, build vs reuse decisions,  etc
Set up engineering processes to streamline solution creation and rollout
Be a hands-on technologist if needed and act as tech lead/architect.
Advise on best practices on maintaining data issues including security, privacy and consent.
Help NGO with the recruiting process as they build their internal tech team.
We have weekly check-ins with all our embedded CxOs so they can compare notes and learn from their peers. Tech4Dev will mentor and work closely with the CxOs and support them when needed.
We expect each fractional CxO to work with 2 or 3 NGOs at the same time
We expect a CxO to work with an NGO between 3 – 9 months
The NGO pays 2/3rd of the salary of the CxO, while Tech4Dev will pay the remaining 1/3rd. We expect the cost of a half time CxO for an NGO to be approx 1 – 1.5L/month. Yes, we know it’s expensive, but we do believe that we need to pay good salaries to recruit great people.
Tech4Dev will continue to support the NGO as it transitions to hiring its own tech resources and/or working with a software partner.
Most of the work that a CxO will do with the NGO will be online. In-person meetings can be arranged based on geographic locations and proximity of NGO and CxO, and preference from each party. NGO will be expected to pick up travel expenses for CxO.
Expectations from NGOs
Your main technology and data systems for your program are relatively stable.
You have decided to invest significant amount of time and resources into your technology and data systems
This is a top 3 priority for your NGO
The CEO and/or COO is driving the process and will work with the CxO especially in the first month.
The CxO will need to spend time across different layers of the organization and also do a few field visits as needed which the NGO will enable.
Next Steps for an NGO
We will be accepting NGOs on a rolling basis based on the capacity of our fractional CxO team. We plan on accepting 5 more NGOs into our pilot cohort in 2022.
Please fill out
our form here
and we will get back to you in 3 business days.

==================================================

It’s been a bit more than 4 months since we kicked off the Fractional CxO pilot program as part of Tech4Dev 2.0.  Vinod and Erica wrote
about our experiences
with
SNEHA Mumbai
. As part of learning more about this space we’ve been having multiple conversations with foundations, collaboratives and NGOs. We’ve also been super lucky from a recruiting perspective, and have managed to get 3 additional individuals at a senior level to help us with this program going forward. Details on this when they start working officially with us from Sept 1. A lot of the below learnings have come about via Vinod’s experience, our collaboration with
The Agency Fund
, and conversations that Erica and I have had with multiple NGOs.
Our first and probably biggest learning was that CTO is a misnomer. While we always knew that technology is a small part of the equation, we soon realized that process + tech strategy, and data were as important as the technology/tools aspect of the program. So we fairly quickly pivoted to using CxO to encompass the things we planned to do which include: in-depth technology support, data strategy and implementation, and process+tech strategy.
We need to engage across the organization to truly determine needs.. When we first started at Sneha, all we heard was Tableau and visualizations but meeting more and more people across Sneha it was apparent the whole data chain needed to be looked at. This coincidentally led us to starting a new
data platform initiative
. We expected the Fractional CxO program to give us ideas on potential new platforms, we just didn’t expect it so soon!
Super surprised but happy to see engagement even at field worker level for data and efficiency in their job – Working digitally because of Covid has changed people’s minds on how digital data can help them work more efficiently and really help them in their jobs – Field workers/supervisors were comfortable using CommCare, WhatsApp and Google sheets doing their jobs and even using it to push back against data teams when there were data discrepancies.
Free or cheap is not exactly free or cheap – what you gain in a free/cheaper product you lose in NGO time and effort away from programmes. I think we all know this but easy to overlook initially and then get stuck. For e.g. super-cheap licenses of Tableau desktop is limiting as the organization grows bigger and field workers start accessing dashboard, the process is cumbersome and not real-time.
Trying to push out stuff faster doesn’t really help in long run if not thought through. This approach is ok for pilots but pilots get integrated into the mainline and then there are issues. For example,SNEHA is now pushing a scheduling application to be prebuilt in CommCare – this was built as a separate app TeamCare which now has been given up and scheduling process is being reworked into CommCare now. This should have been considered before building TeamCare. As a side effect, this also means our team needs to have a good sense of the capabilities of existing platforms like Avni, CommCare, Survey CTO and more.
Issue in all of tech but I think more in especially NGO world – time allocation for up-skilling leading to singular points of failure or slowdown of processes. In SNEHA’s case a week to two of training effort per year for personnel in SQL and possibly Python/R (some have rudimentary skills in this) would help alleviate a lot of this. As part of the Fractional CxO program, we need to focus on up-skilling and increasing the tech capacity of NGOs. We don’t want them to depend on us forever.
NGOs need to make the Fractional CxO a priority. In SNEHA’s case, Vanessa (the ED) was driving the process which helped everyone realize the importance of the project and hence we could make rapid progress and meet with folks across the hierarchy. If it takes an NGO multiple weeks to respond and follow up on our meeting notes and action items, it is likely not to be a successful engagement.
Process is more important than technology. Organizations need to have a good understanding of who will be using the product, how will they be using it, and how will they integrate it with their existing systems.
NGOs and collaboratives need to start taking data consent, privacy and security a lot more seriously. While data sharing is good and beneficial to the sector, we need to ensure that we respect the individual’s right to privacy and get consent while following applicable best practices. While we are not experts on this (as yet!), we know enough to be dangerous.
This is a bit ironic since I am also a funder. Funders in general should not be involved in technology decisions / implementation. In the few cases where they should be, it should be more of a partnership and for the long term. Making recommendations to folks who know a fair bit about the space is probably the best approach. We’ve seen a few projects languish due to this.
More learnings from the field to come in the next few weeksTitle: Fractional CxO – A brief recap on our pilot experiments
Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

We started experimenting with the
Fractional CxO
concept approximately 6 months ago. At that time we really did not have this planned, but knew there was something that we should test out with a few NGOs and see what happens. This blog post is also my way of documenting things, so that we remember what we did and hopefully avoid some of the mistakes we’ve made in the past. The ongoing pilot talks about our experiences with the 7 NGOs, though 3 of them are in the super early stages (less than a month)
Our first experience was with a small NGO, with a budget of 1 – 2 CR. From a tech perspective, they were attempting to solve a fairly nice problem and had an issue with some of their previous software partners. This was also when I shockingly heard that WordPress is not scalable from a software company that came highly recommended.  Yes, this is what some software companies use to justify building custom solutions. Our main concern before starting the engagement was if the founder had enough bandwidth to manage the project. He was super committed, but had too many things going on, and could not delegate this to anyone else. So while it was high priority, given all the other things on his plate, it was not the most important. In a few months, we realized this would not work out and decided to move on. Fortunately, we did not spend significant time on it either.
The second NGO was a medium sized NGO working in the community health space. We found a volunteer in the US who was moving to India who seemed keen to give it a shot. This was a match made in heaven across all parties. The NGO was committed, was using technology in a really effective manner, had pretty good processes and the project was strongly supported by the CEO. We lucked out with an equally committed volunteer who was curious, methodical and interested. This was an amazing success, the volunteer has now joined Tech4Dev full time. The NGO is now our first paying Fractional CxO engagement. Overall this is how we prefer all pilots to go 🙂 A win-win-win for everyone involved.
The third NGO was a small tech first NGO doing some pretty innovative work, but with tech systems semi-cobbled together. Due to some good luck on the timing perspective, we managed to have an all day face-2-face meeting with the NGO with most of the folks in the room. At the end of the meeting, we felt there was some unknown in the program delivery. We decided to potentially engage with them in the future when things were a bit more clear. I went into this NGO fairly certain that it was a great match, but have realized that having a better understanding of the NGO along with their needs is super important. Going forward we will definitely meet with an NGO for a longer meeting before deciding on them
The fourth NGO was a medium sized NGO that we matched with a volunteer. While we do not think the Fractional CxO is a volunteer type engagement, we’ve gotten a few good folks who were planning to move to India soon, willing to commit 10 hours/week and interested in working in the social sector. Due to multiple factors, this did not work out from our end. The volunteers are continuing to work directly with the NGO which we agreed might be a better model in this case. Still trying to learn and digest the lessons from this one, and what we could have done differently. I do think we need to play a bigger role in the initial process (maybe first 3-6 weeks) and ensure that both the volunteer and the NGO are living up to their commitment and we can get things moving earlier.
The seventh NGO is a work in progress. We are incorporating the lessons from the fourth NGO and are going to get involved immediately. Hopefully this will help kick things off and get things moving in the right direction.
The fifth and sixth NGOs have been long time friends and partners of Tech4Dev. We recently hired a full time fractional CxO to work with these two organizations exclusively. Since all of us were venturing into the unknown, we figured a 3 month trial period would be a good way to start things. We do think the two NGOs have potentially quite a lot in common from a tech perspective and can afford a CxO as a joint entity, so am curious as to how this will turn out. For now our strategy is: Month 1 is mainly with NGO 5, with 10% of time on NGO 6. Month 2 is mainly with NGO 6, with 10% of time on NGO 5.  Month 3 is potentially mixing and matching the needs of both and deciding on next steps.
As we are looking to expand our pilot programs, we just put out a
call for applications to NGOs earlier today
, We’ll continue to document our learnings, successes and failures and bring you on our journeyTitle: Fractional CxO

==================================================

NGOs typically dont have in-house technical expertise and they feel intimidated by technology. Often, the NGO staff have the vision but because of their non-technical backgrounds, they feel unable to engage with technology professionals. This pattern is fairly prevalent in the social sector in India.
Over the past few years, Tech4Dev has built a network of whetted and reliable software partners who know how to work with NGOs, have proven experience of working with NGOs building applications for them and work with NGOs professionally and with high integrity. Tech4Dev technologist associates act as Fractional CxOs to evaluate technology needs, help recruit technology personnel and to recommend and evaluate a reliable and proven software firm to carry out software projects.
We see this program to help NGOs that dont have any technical expertise in-house as well as those that need help evaluating their technology needs, suggest solutions etc. The details of the program are as follows
An engagement with a technologist who spends a few hours a week with the NGO.
Assistance with identifying a technically sound solution
Assisting with hiring technology personnel at the NGO
We believe this program will also help NGO participants to demonstrate to their funders that they have a reliable organization helping them with capacity building.Title: Free Tech Consulting for Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Providers

==================================================

By Jessica Hubley, CEO,
AnnieCannons
We?re excited to kick off service provider consultation as an initial step in planning the scope and functionality of the ReferAll platform. We?re first offering Bay Area providers in housing and case management the opportunity to get free technology and process consulting on their existing services model. Here?s how that works:
Our CEO and one of our developers will reserve a half-day with the providers to conduct interviews that help us understand the details of current operational processes like intake and qualification, services delivery, personnel setup, and impact measurement. We?ll look at what technology tools are already being used and whether they are being used efficiently. We?re looking to understand where staff spend the most time and/or energy, or where the organization spends the most money, to scope how the application of technology can help improve processes. Next, we?ll dig deep on reporting requirements for major funders (both digital and analog) to understand the data outputs required of each participating provider.
Providers can host us on-site, or meet with us near their site if their physical location cannot be accessed by visitors.? Either way, we?ll provide a Confidentiality Agreement to give comfort that anything the provider shares – from location to impact measurements – stays confidential.
With this information in hand, we will prepare customized technology recommendations of free or very affordable solutions that can assist staff, or entirely replace the need for staff time to complete critical functions.? We?ll then prepare a written report for the provider of these tools and where to find them, and set up either a video chat or a second brief visit to help install them as well as train key staff on using them.  All of this is free to the provider, because Chintu Gudiya Foundation has provided support to cover the costs of this consultation, and it also serves to help us plan for the most effective development plan for our ReferAll platform.
We aim to do this with minimal time commitment from the provider to help them ensure they can continue focusing on their work. We?d schedule:
60 minute interview with the Executive Director or CEO on intake, criteria, continuum of care services offered at the provider, duration of services, reporting obligations, and technology usage from a management perspective
30 minute interview with the head of Operations (if different) on staff time allocation, staff performance evaluations, and reporting obligations/pain points as well as criteria, capacity and turnover review
30 minute interview with head of fundraising or development on reporting obligations and impact measurements
10 minute lighting session with other each staff member to survey and document how their time is typically spent throughout the day?
Following this session, we?d prepare a custom written report on process improvements available through use of technology solutions to share back with the participating service provider. We will also schedule a 30-45 minute session with the provider?s team (attendees to be selected by the provider) to present our findings and teach you how to install and use the recommended technology tools.

==================================================

A
Housing Provider Technology Consulting
Offering
by Jessica HUbley, CEO, AnnieCannons
AnnieCannons will provide free tech training to participating housing and/or case management providers in exchange for research partnership on a software platform solution we are developing in partnership with the Chintu Gudiya Foundation. We?re choosing these partners because we value their insights as those who have a long history of serving survivors, and want to leverage their experience to make our technology solutions better.  In exchange, we’re offering free consulting to help them do their work better now with training on free or low cost tech solution that can help them work smarter.
The tech consulting and training will include both (i) a standard set of free or donated software that we believe can help anti-trafficking organizations run more effectively for less cost and (ii) a follow-up written recommendations of additional technology tools that we believe could help the particular challenges faced by the organizations we interview and research.
What?s Involved?
This will involve both (a) a pre-submission of existing materials to us and (b) an in-person interview session. Both will allow us to understand what challenges your organization can overcome through free or donated technology.
How do we protect Confidentiality?
Confidentiality agreements are available if desired by the provider. Alternately, we can host staff in our Oakland offices if a physical location must remain confidential. If possible through confidentiality agreement, we believe we can provide better insight by observing physical systems, so prefer to visit your site.  Either way, and regardless of any agreements, we are intimately aware of the need for security in this work, and will maintain careful protection of any information we receive or review during this process.
Information Sharing
. Your organization will be asked to provide copies of existing materials and spend less than 30 minutes gathering them for us no less than 1 week before your interview day so we can review them before our visit. We ask that you provide:
A list of your Staff and a summary of their roles
List of funders (only if you have reporting requirements to them)
Any technology tools currently in use and/or being paid for
Survivor consent forms/process
Survivor residency requirements ((i) age, demographic, dependents, etc.; (ii) participation requirements such as AA meetings, Bible Study, surrender of devices, etc)
Data points gathered during survivor intake, including the questions candidates are asked
For anything not easy to gather, we will collect it day of and consider it in the custom technology recommendations.
Interview and Workshop Day
. The participating organization is asked to schedule a half-day session for our team.  During this session, we?d both conduct interview and the standard offer training. While as many staff as desired can attend the training, for the interviews we specifically plan for:
60 minute interview with ED/CEO on mission, intake, criteria, continuum of care services provided, duration of services, reporting obligations (especially grant reporting), fundraising challenges that tech might help with, and current technology usage. A services program director may provide this information, if more suitable to your organization.
30 minute interview with Operations director (if different) on staff time allocation, staff success evaluations, and reporting obligations/pain points as well as hiring criteria, staff capacity challenges and attrition review
30 minute interview with Fundraising director on reporting obligations, current data collection practices, and impact measurements
10 minute workshop to quickly build ?self-org charts? with each staff member for small orgs or each manager for larger orgs.  These charts reflect how the staffer/manager spends their days
Custom Technology Report
. Within 2-4 weeks following your interview day, AnnieCannons will share back a written report noting additional technology tools or discounts we?ve found that might help your org operate more efficiently and ease staff pain points. Follow-up written process recommendations report will be shared with Tech4Dev and applicable provider only.?

.Title: From Architecting Tech Giants to Strengthening Grassroots Impact: Devi’s Journey into the Social Sector
Author: Deepak Nanda
Date: April 2025
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/from-architecting-tech-giants-to-strengthening-grassroots-impact-devis-journey-into-the-social-sector/
==================================================

“What am I doing?”
This single question sparked a journey of transformation for Devi, who went from leading engineering teams in major tech companies to embedding herself within the fabric of nonprofit systems that often lack even the most basic technological infrastructure.
In conversation with Deepak from Project Tech4Dev, Devi shares the arc of this journey—one that many professionals in the private sector may resonate with but few dare to take.
A Leap from the Known
After 18 years in tech, including roles as a Principal Engineer and Architect across global MNCs and startups, Devi had reached a professional high. But with that came a sense of detachment.
“I had it all—global roles, diverse domains, scale, influence. But then I found myself asking repeatedly,
‘What am I doing?’
I realized I needed to pause.”
That pause became a one-year sabbatical. During this time, she volunteered to teach 4th-grade English and supported small-scale education and climate-focused startups. But most importantly, she explored. There were no concrete plans—just a desire to discover what
really
mattered to her.
Finding Her Fit—Not as a Founder, but as a Force
While surrounded by social entrepreneurs building their own initiatives, Devi had a realization.
“I was exploring whether I could start something of my own. But through that process, I realized that I’m far more suited to contribute meaningfully
within
existing efforts.”
It was serendipity that led her to the
Fractional CxO (fCxO) program
by Project Tech4Dev. A LinkedIn post brought her attention to a role that bridged her skill set with a purpose-driven path.
“When I saw the description, it clicked. I could see how I could apply my skills, even coming from a tech-heavy background, to problems that matter deeply in the social sector.”
Transitioning into Scarcity
The move wasn’t just a change in domain—it was a shift in mindset.
“Coming from an MNC, I’d never even factored cost into my architectural solutions. We were optimizing for scalability, uptime, performance. Here, I now check the
pricing page
before even considering a tool.”
Working with NGOs that lack dedicated tech teams—and sometimes even data clarity—meant learning to navigate resource constraints creatively. Devi’s first engagement was with a Pune-based NGO running five programs
without a single tech person on staff.
“It was a crash course in building trust, working within limitations, and finding solutions that are ‘good enough,’ not perfect.”
Tech Isn’t Always the Answer
One of the most refreshing parts of Devi’s role is the freedom to say
no
—not to NGOs, but to unnecessary tech.
“Sometimes, it’s clear that what an NGO needs isn’t technology—it’s a process fix. Our application process actually helps them realize that. We ask:
Is tech even in your top three priorities this year?
”
This clarity ensures that when engagements do move forward, they’re grounded in real needs, not just trends.
Reframing Innovation and Ownership
Working in the social sector also brought up questions around data, openness, and trust.
“In tech, we talk about open-source code. But in nonprofits, data—especially research or beneficiary data—is the core IP. I began asking:
Can we treat program data like open-source code?
Can it be reused, built upon, shared?”
This often meets hesitation, rooted in fear, compliance, and the sector’s own trust deficit. But through gentle conversations and “aha” moments—like showcasing relevant open data examples—Devi is planting seeds for a culture shift.
Lessons in Humility and Co-Creation
What makes the fCxO experience unique, Devi believes, is the intentionality behind the matching process and the mutual respect that it fosters.
“There’s no savior complex here. We’re not parachuting in with all the answers. We ask questions. We listen. We
build together.
”
She credits the first three months of just shadowing fellow fCxOs—like Thomas and Vinod—and observing their engagement styles as being foundational to her own transition.
A Call to Tech Professionals
Devi’s story is both inspiration and invitation. For tech professionals wondering if there’s a more meaningful way to apply their skills, the social sector offers rich, complex problems that demand empathy, curiosity, and collaboration.
“It’s not about doing less. It’s about doing differently. And often, with far more impact.”

Author: Akhilesh Negi
Date: October 2023

==================================================

The Tech4dev Sprints hit the road again, this time landing in Kochi This time we were staying at
Courtyard by Marriott, Kochi
conveniently next to the airport  perfect for the squad coming in from all over the world. This sprint was split in two: first, exploring our experimental initiative, Data Catalyst, and then, a deep dive with our Glific NGO partners on generative AI.
To give a  bit of background about Data Catalyst,
Our platforms:
Glific
,
Avni
and
Dalgo
have a focus on on-boarding as many NGOs as possible at relatively low cost. Hence our close interaction with most of these NGOs (beyond the onboarding and initial setup) is fairly limited. On the flip side, our
Fractional CxO
program is a highly intensive (half time typically) 6-9 month engagement with medium-large NGOs. We had enough data points from both these interactions, to realize the need for a program around data in general and
responsible technology + data
in specific. Read in detail here in  Abhishek Nairs
blog
With Data Catalyst, we  wanted to give NGOs the tools to work with data like pros. But, were also humble enough to admit we didnt have all the answers. So, we teamed up with
Dasra
,
GoalKeep
and
Agency Fund
.
Most of us arrived in Kochi on sunday as we prepare for next 4 days of work, socializing, understanding NGOs program, brainstorming solution and a lot more.  I was quite excited for the both part of the sprint as for Data catalyst I was with Lobo and Radhika where we were SPOC for two NGOs namely SeSta and OBLF
A bit about them:
SesTA
empowers North East India’s rural communities, especially women, through socio-economic support in over 2200 villages. They provide skill development, link women to social security schemes, and promote sustainable agriculture. Through an 8-year model, SeSTA steers communities towards self-reliance and tech enhancement.
Sudha and Faiza sharing about OBLF
OBLF
aims to uplift underprivileged communities in Anekal Taluk through education, women empowerment, and healthcare. Despite India’s urban growth, places like Anekal struggle with 30% illiteracy. OBLF’s approach includes English teaching programs, women’s training, and primary healthcare. They’re now amping things up with their digital platform, Invigorate, to reach and teach even more folks.
Radhika and I teamed up to work with SesTA, while Lobo dove into things with OBLF. Our days were split between morning presentation and discussions and evening work sessions. At one point, Swapneel shared how each NGO could choose one or two focus areas for growth in next three months. SesTA went for data collection and visualization. It was great working with Ritika from SesTA as she explains the ins and outs of their work, how they gather data, and the challenges they’re looking to overcome. Excited to see where they’ll be in three months. We’re catching up again in January for round two of Data Catalyst!
Another thing I was really looking forward to was meeting Edmund from Agency Fund. We’ve been collaborating on this OpenLLM repo for the past few weeks. Basically it is a generative AI to generate answers from a custom knowledgebase which will then be integrated into Glific via APIs.
Read progress with GPT and generative AI in Glific so far here:
ChatGPT comes to Glific
ChatGPT Unleashed: Journey to Production and preparing for launch on Glific
We kicked things off with Jugalbandi, a decent starting point for ChatGPT and generative AI exploration from NGO point of view. It gave them a chance to run a small pilot, see how it felt, and figure out if it’s their cup of tea. But as we start making more progress in this and talked with a few other NGOs, we come across few other amazing capabilities of GPT like function calling, and retaining conversation memory for better context aware answers  exactly what many NGOs are after. So we chose to work on our own LLM project because these aspects match what many NGOs require, and Agency Fund has been a big help
So far in the past few weeks we were able to setup base version of the LLM capability where user ask question and answer is generated from custom knowledgebase.
In first few days we were able to knock off few issues which are significant steps forward in our LLM repo. Huge shoutout to Edmund for all the work which he had done that helped greatly in getting things done quickly. Once development was completed, we deployed the latest version of it, Thanks to Rohit Chatterjee
In just a few weeks, we got the basic LLM feature up and running, where users can ask questions and get answers straight from our custom knowledge base. Early on, we knock off few issues that pushed our LLM project forward big time. In addition to helping us in development, Edmund also held a session where he explained the basics of ChatGPT and LLM and how powerful it is and can be used by NGOs
Once we done with the development, Rohit Chatterjee helped in deploying the laterst version, bringing more of the new magic of generative ai.We even had a sneak peek demo showcasing how it works with Glific and shared what’s our plan for  upcoming weeks will be.
Stay tuned, because we’re gearing up to weave openLLM even tighter into Glific for a seamless integration.
Key highlights from the sprint are
Morning walks started gaining more and more traction with new sprints, this time a majority of people joined morning 6:30 walks led by lobo
Finally a sprint with great filter coffee to begin our day and get charged for the day, we used to have two cups atleast to begin our day which worked like double battery to run all day
The Data Catalyst sessions were on point: started and wrapped up as planned. On the other hand, Glific LLM sessions were more flexible, letting NGOs and experts dive deep into the wonders of GPT and collaborate more
Nothing beats working in person and having long coding sessions. Really enjoyed working with Edmund from Agency Fund
As we’re teaming up with NGOs for a solid three months, it gives us a good chunk of time to really dive deep and assist them. It’s not just about the tech side of things. We get to understand their challenges more intimately. In shorter projects, there’s a tendency to quickly jump to solutions without fully grasping their issues and seeing where they’re coming from.
Sessions held by Edmund and Aman really helped in educating NGOs with nuances of GPT and pushes them to start implementing and building on top of knowledge the acquired in these insightful sessions
Undoubtedly one of the most intense sprints with long hours of work. But the best part was we all achieved a lot in such short duration and a day off at the end. A perfect chance for us to hang out, chill, and really get to know each other outside of work.Title: From Flows to Forecasts: My Khopoli Sprint 🚀

==================================================

This was my
third sprint
at Tech4Dev, but unlike the last two, this one had a slightly new flavour to it —I’m officially no longer a probationer this sprint (yay! 🥳), and just when I thought I could catch my breath… boom 💥 — new beginnings came knocking (in the best way possible).
The Shift That Just
Clicked
🔄
This sprint hit different. I moved from the world of Glific consulting and product (flows, PRDs, stakeholders’ perception/expectations management, webinars, streamlining internal processes —each experience shaping my learning.…) to
Dalgo BizDev
(lead generation, outreach, pre-sales, partnerships, market research, pipeline management, sales strategy, customer discovery, forecasting, demos, relationship building, feedback/follow-ups and much more..)— or how I like to put it, from
flows to forecasts
, from
product to pipeline
📊. What I hadn’t fully realized was how these very experiences were quietly preparing me for areas I feel most energized by—business development, strategy, process-building, and action-oriented execution.💼
The best part? The shift didn’t feel like a big “announcement” or “role change” — it felt like a natural next step, deeply supported and encouraged 💛. There was so much
trust
and
openness
from everyone. And just when I was ready to explore, the opportunity with Dalgo came at the right time — like a door opening the moment I reached it. Couldn’t have asked for a better transition.
Big thanks to the
Glific team
for shaping me (spl. thanks to Krishna, Radhika, Anandu, Aishwarya & Sangeeta), and massive love to the
Dalgo team
(spl. thanks to Ashwin, Abhishek, Siddhant & Himanshu) for taking me in with so much warmth, faith, and space to grow 🙌🌱.
The Sprint — Heartfelt Highlights ✨
💬
Day 1 @ Dalgo
started with a retro, and sure, I was nervous (new team, new domain..). But honestly, the team made it feel like I already belonged. I wasn’t just “joining,” I was being
integrated
— with so many 1:1s, deep convos, direction, and space to pitch in. We wrapped up the week with a solid plan. 🔥
🎯
Anto’s & Deepak’s Strategy Simulation
was a total highlight for me. It was like being in a high-energy zone of ideas, debates, and lightbulb moments 💡. What hit me most was — despite being from different teams, our reflections were surprisingly aligned. That’s the kind of
shared mindset
that keeps the culture here strong 💪.
🤖
Major shoutout to Akansha
for using the Glific chatbot throughout to keep the sprint lively! 💬 It was so refreshing to see tech used like that — quizzes, reminders, nudges — all inside the bot. That’s
real innovation
in how we do even the smallest things 👏.
Where Values Showed Up (Without Saying the Words) 💡
had to reach Mumbai earlier than others due to a personal work, and the team supported my travel without any ifs or buts. No fixed rules like “you can only fly when the sprint starts.” Some team members arrived earlier or stayed longer around the sprint and took leaves for refreshing themselves — and no one was grilled. There’s
trust and maturity
in how personal choices are respected. That freedom is rare, and it says a lot about the culture here. 🙌
🗣️ We had a
dedicated feedback session
during the sprint. What I loved most wasn’t just that we were
allowed
to share, but that the
top leadership genuinely nudged us to
. Here, feedback isn’t a checkbox. It’s a temperature check. And if something’s off — they don’t just say, “We’ll look into it.” They actually do. If a fix isn’t possible, they
tell us the why
. That transparency builds way more than satisfaction — it builds
trust
. This kind of
openness and collaboration
isn’t easy to find, and I don’t take it for granted.
👀 Another reflection —When people get siloed within their departments, it’s easy to lose sight of what others are dealing with. That’s where
cross-team understanding
and
leadership
step in — not just to remind us of our own responsibilities, but to help us see what others are carrying and how deeply interconnected our efforts are. Whether it’s bizdev, product, support, HR/admin, or engineering — everyone has their own load, pressures, and priorities. And the same is true for the NGOs we work with. They’re already stretched thin with program implementation and monitoring, often juggling far more than what’s visible. That’s why it matters when we think ahead for them — when we proactively simplify, support, and make their experience smoother. What struck me is how this same mindset applies within our own teams too. If we can look out for each other with the same care and empathy, real collaboration follows. That’s how we start to truly appreciate one another’s work and build deeper trust across the board. That’s
true collaboration
❤️.
Our sprint happened alongside the
Dasra retreat
, and that gave me a rare chance to reconnect with my batchmates and the team there. During one session, I joined a discussion on a use case — and got to help them think through how tech could be leveraged to address on-ground/program challenges 🧠📱. In return, I got a deeper glimpse into their lived experiences in the field — and that’s the kind of
ecosystem learning
I treasure.
Looking Ahead 👣
This new chapter in
bizdev
feels just right. My previous learnings in product, consulting, research, stakeholder engagement, communication, biasness towards  action — everything now adds up as I build pipelines, think strategy, and align efforts with our larger vision.
Grateful for every single person who made this sprint meaningful, exciting, human, and full of possibilities. You reminded me why this org exists — not just to build tech, but to
build better systems with and for the social sector
🌍.
Let’s keep showing up with curiosity, building with care, and dreaming with boldness 💛💭Title: From Funnels to Prototypes: A Journey through Banglore Sprint
Author: Glific Admin

==================================================

This blog is written by Arushi Kapoor and Poojita from
Avanti Fellows
Working in a social sector can sometimes be very demanding and overwhelming where we are constantly striving for the larger good and sometimes work in isolation. Key tasks of the 3-day sprint were majorly divided into:
User Funnels
Identifying which segment of the funnel to focus on & building a prototype
Experimentation – A/B testing
On the first day, when we presented our funnel, we deliberately focused on Desired Outcome, the segment we were unsure what/ how to track, to get ideas and suggestions from The Agency Fund (TAF) & the other organizations. As we proceeded with that day’s activities, we quickly realized that our WAU definition would have to be tweaked to be more aligned with our theory of change. We realized that we needed to track % watch time of plios for weekly active/regular students (engagement of students) instead of just tracking attendance. This was our major takeaway from day 1. This fed into our Day 2 activities and most of the exercises revolved around improving Plio watchtime.
The second day started with a session by Yuxi Liu on User Experience. This was particularly significant for us as we could discuss a critical decision we recently made to pause development on one of our products, the Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), due to the user feedback we had received. She dug deeper into it and gave us valuable insights on why it could have gone wrong; our clickable prototype might have been viewed as too finalized and students were perhaps overwhelmed and felt that they could not make any changes – this could have limited their feedback. She, along with TAP’s UX Designer, Fatema, suggested that we go to them with paper-drawn prototypes and invite them to the drawing board (we’ll probably write another blog on how this goes!). We might start thinking about LAD in some time.
We had a very active session with James from TAF on Intervention Design, where we deep-dived into how to identify the funnel stage to target, brainstorm on how our end user’s motivations & capabilities affect the action we want them to take, generate intervention idea and prioritize them based on impact and feasibility. We identified that our largest drop-off was at the engagement stage and the action we want our students to take is to increase their watchtime on our Plios. The activities were designed in such a way that we could logically come up with ideas that could improve this metric. Our students are highly motivated by the scorecard that appears after completion of the Plios; they take screenshots, edit them with their photos/ trophy emojis, and share them in the WA group. The scorecard highlights the Accuracy % and has no mention of the Watchtime. We decided to replace accuracy with watchtime on the scorecard and test if that has an impact on the average watchtime%. We then moved on to build prototypes for this intervention. (details of the above can be found
here
)
On the third day, we delved into how to design an experiment and A/B testing mechanics. We were in the process of structuring an experiment to see which of our two intervention ideas would yield better results but unfortunately, ran out of time. We got to learn about the A/B testing software that is being built for Rocket Learning. We never knew that it could be so easy to pull out the sample for A/B tests by using such software where the entire data of our program is already stored at the backend and we just need to put in our requirements and tada the experiment sampling is ready.
The Agency Fund Sprints have always been useful for meeting organizations working in the same ecosystem we learned a lot, to name some:
Rocket Learning – The scale they are targeting is massive. Some of the features they use in their teacher product are interesting -. Signals (green, yellow, red) to indicate the status of their target metrics
Saajha – They presented the list of experiments they had run on the ground. It was so grounding to hear about what was learned from every experiment and how funding also plays a key role in the scale and choice of experiments. Their experiment log discipline is very commendable!
The Apprentice Project – TAP is working in the domain of 21st-century skills. We are also building a career guidance vertical for our product. We can learn more about their product since we need to equip students with 21st-century skills to make them career-ready.
Thinking after a few days about the sprint now, here are some of our reflections on the 3 days we spent together:
Sprint Positives:
We could deep dive into the gaps in the data we track for our product during the detailed prework while discussing with different stakeholders within the team.
We interacted with many organizations and understood their processes through the activity pairing. We didn’t have to just do the activity on our own as every organization was paired with another and we had the opportunity to discuss both products. It was refreshing to have a second opinion on how we were going about our solutions.
Facilitators from The Agency Fund were always there to facilitate the group discussions. There was someone from TAF who would go over the activity each team was doing and either give their input or suggest how we could overcome whatever complication we were having. They suggested we connect to the researchers and organizations working in the same field. In our case, they suggested looking into healing classrooms to improve the attitudes of the students.
Some suggestions:
In a few sessions, we could not complete the given task but had to jump to another task due to the time limit. There was a lot of time spent on the first few agenda items that were covered in the prework, such as what are funnel metrics, how they should be defined, etc. The later activities like the experiment design, which are more complex could have been allocated more time
There was no intersection between 2 tracks, LLM and User Engagement- if we had some intersection, maybe some solutions to our product issues may have been solved there and then.
One of the combined sessions: Reflections on Udhyam Foundation’s Journey
Overall the sprint was very useful in giving us a framework/ process towards identifying where we need to focus on and design thinking. It also greatly enabled us to network with not just organizations in the same ecosystem but with individuals in similar roles, engaging in similar day-to-day product work. We, for sure, are going to ring up at least three PMs we met in this workshop, the next time we need a second opinion or guidance!
It’s a wrapTitle: From Glific to Something Bigger

==================================================

It’s been three months since our small team started working on the new AI platform. You can check out the full list of our initial goals and ideas in
this kickoff blog
.
As we wanted to centralize our AI efforts, which were previously scattered across multiple products like Glific, Dalgo, and Avni. We also want to make them accessible to NGOs without needing to be customer of one of the platforms while still be able to use the AI in their existing solutions. To kick things off with version 1.0, we began migrating Glific’s filesearch use case onto this centralized platform, starting with a few NGOs and then expanding gradually. By doing this, we’re also setting the stage for integrating helpful tools like Langfuse for better observability and evaluation.This blog is around Glific migration and changes we did to make it happen
About Glific
Glific is an open-source, WhatsApp-based communication tool we’ve been building over the past 5 years. It helps NGOs connect and communicate better with their communities on a larger scale. Last year, we integrated OpenAI Filesearch into Glific. This lets us quickly create a searchable knowledge base from uploaded documents, link it to an AI Assistant, and get answers directly from it.
Read more about our journey here:
Enhancing Communication with AI and Text-to-Speech in Glific
OpenAI has a Python SDK for Filesearch, but we built our integration using Elixir because there weren’t any existing packages for Elixir at that time.
AI Platform Implementation
Initially, we’ve created a new endpoint,
/threads
. It accepts a user’s question, an assistant_id, and optionally a thread_id. It either creates a new OpenAI thread or uses an existing one, runs it, and produces an answer. We also include a callback URL parameter, which OpenAI will ping with the results once the thread run finishes.
The process looks like this:
Glific Implementation
In Glific, we’ve added two things:
A new node,
call_and_wait
, which takes, API Key as headers, input parameters and an endpoint to call.
A new endpoint,
/flow_resume
, which validates responses via a signature, and then resumes the conversation flow based on contact_id and flow_id provided in the response.
While these two things are right now configured to be used AI Platform, it can also be used by NGOs to plug and play with their own hosted models and try on Glific.
While these additions are wired to work with our AI platform today, but they’re flexible enough for NGOs to experiment with their own AI models as well using the same steps
Wrapping Up
This migration was more like a step toward making AI more accessible and modular for NGOs. We’re keeping things small, focused, and transparent—starting with Glific, but with the flexibility to support other tools and custom use cases down the line. It will also help us stress-test the AI platform with real users and real workflows. More updates soon as we continue to expand and learn.

At Antarang Foundation, the mission is clear: to equip youth from underserved communities with the guidance and skills they need to build meaningful careers. Working with students from government schools between grades 9 to 12, the team supports their career development journeys through structured guidance and skill-building. In this blog, we learn from Akshata who is an Assistant Manager (Product Development) at the foundation, on how the organisation used Dalgo to automate data insights.
The Challenge: Too Many Tools, Too Much Manual Work
Before Dalgo, Akshata and her team faced a mountain of data management hurdles:
Student and program data came in from various sources like Salesforce, Kobo toolbox, Glific, and more.
Data would be pulled from Salesforce to Google sheets, wherein if the sheet limits exceeded, the team would have to create another sheet.
It became challenging for 1-2 people within the same organisation to handle large datasets.
Every change required building connections between tools — a time-consuming and error-prone process.
“We used to create reports in salesforce and pull that data into google sheets manually, and if the limit for google sheets exceeds, we would have to create another google sheet.” Akshata shared.
Enter Dalgo: A Smart, Flexible Data Layer
Seeing the possibilities Dalgo could provide, the team at Antarang quickly adopted it.
With Dalgo, the following changed:
✅ Automated Data Ingestion: Data flows seamlessly from Salesforce and other sources.
✅ Customizable Pipelines: The team can now define their own data transformation rules to clean, join, and map fields as needed.
✅ Orchestration Made Simple: Once configured, Dalgo takes care of running and updating these pipelines on schedule.
✅ No More Manual Sheets Overload: The Google Sheets workaround is now a thing of the past.
“We got to know there is a tool that automatically ingests data from any source and automatically orchestrates. And we happily adopted Dalgo. ” Akshata explained.
The Result: More Time for Impact
By removing the friction from data workflows, Dalgo has enabled Antarang team to manage and visualise their data efficiently. With better visibility, faster reporting, and far less manual work, data is now an enabler for teams.
“Dalgo automatically ingested data from Salesforce, google sheets and Kobo toolbox and we could customise the same.” Akshata said.
Looking Ahead
Antarang Foundation’s journey with Dalgo is just beginning, but it’s already a powerful example of how the right tech can empower social impact teams to do more with less. Their story shows how complex, multi-source data can be streamlined, unlocking the path from raw data to reliable insights.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Glific

==================================================

It?s been almost a month I?m working on the open-source project with Tech4Dev. Prior to this, I had been a part of many enterprise applications in several domains including the social sector. With a deep desire to explore more areas, I found one of the interesting aspects of this project to be functional programming. We?ve taken our time for exploration and strategize how we will mold it to fit our use case.
Why functional programming?
As the core of the project is to maintain two-way communication and capture data exchanged between nonprofits and beneficiaries, we knew from the beginning that our tech-stack should support the following requirements:
Message sending and receiving capabilities in real-time.
High performance and low response time.
Capacity to store a huge user base where each user may have hundreds of thousands of chat messages and media files.
Searching through these vast amounts of information should be fast.
Concurrent processing and the ability to send multiple requests/seconds.
All these to be supported easily by average hardware and easy installation.
It?s clear that we need a solid framework with a robust underlying foundation that handles these needs out-of-the-box. After thorough research, we found our match with Elixir.
Elixir uses the Erlang VM, which is known for its lightweight nature and it?s pretty common to have millions of processes running concurrently in the same machine. Telecommunications markets use it to maintain high-speed data flow.
This article
elaborates more on why Elixir is better suited for these concepts.
All of this started my journey into functional programming.
Transitioning to Functional Programming
I?ve been a big fan of Javascript, especially due to its flexibility. That?s where I first get acquainted with functional programming concepts. Like any new language, I started from the
Elixir documentation
and the articles from the community experts.
Coming from Object-Oriented programming, this was a paradigm shift for me. As I dug deeper into the concepts, I was curious to know what more it can do.
Once I got a good grasp on the basics from the documentation, I moved to
Exercism
and started solving the exercises there. I also posted some of my exercises
solutions on GitHub
.
If you are also starting your journey into Elixir/functional programming, here are some recommended tips which have always worked for me:
Start with the official documentation. Don?t take any shortcuts.
If possible, get someone to mentor. He/she will give you a lot of insights that you?ll not be able to find online.
Focus on exercises that are more in-line with your use case.
Try sticking to a small prototype for your project.
Once I finished a small prototype of the use case, I could clearly see where and how Elixir is helping to overcome challenges using its concise modules and functional workflows.
Conclusion
When you start a new technology, the possibilities it opens up to build ideas are just infinite. Lobo has been a great partner in pair-programming sessions and helping to see through abstractions in the early phase of our exploration.
It?s a long journey and I along with my team are taking one step at a time. There are many things I discover every day and I?ll keep sharing them on this channel.Title: From Project Selection to Building an Airbyte Connector: My ongoing Journey with C4GT 2023�
Author: Aviraj Gour
Date: June 2023
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/from-project-selection-to-building-an-airbyte-connector-my-ongoing-journey-with-c4gt-2023/
==================================================

Hey everyone, I am Aviraj Gour, a 3rd year student Mathematics and computing at NIT, Hamirpur. Today, I am excited to share with you my journey of working on an exciting project as a part of C4GT 2023. Let me take you through my exciting journey of seizing this incredible opportunity, starting from choosing the project to crafting a proposal, and sharing my experiences so far.
Excited by the program vision, I started by exploring the project available in the c4gt 2023 program. With over 100+ projects from 30+ organisations, options were abundant. So all the projects were listed on github, on the basis of my skill set I started  marking projects, and ended up marking more than 15 projects. Then I again went through all the projects and started understanding the projects, then I came through 2-3 projects that hit me and I was like this are the projects I want to work on. After investing additional effort and conducting thorough research, I ultimately made the decision to work on the Airbyte connector for the Avni project under the DevDataPlatform.
After selecting the project, I started interacting with DevDataPlatform/Tech4Dev community, I started with introducing myself then started working on project basic details. Siddhant, my project mentor, has been an invaluable source of support continuously. He introduced me to the Avni platform and has been there for me whenever I needed assistance. We have regular meetups to discuss the project, and he consistently ensures that I am making progress and offers guidance along the way.
About project :
The goal is to develop a source connector for Avni, enabling NGOs using Avni to utilize Airbyte for their data management requirements.
The source connector for Avni will enable Avni users to extract data from Avni’s databases or APIs and replicate it into Airbyte’s standardized data format. This integration will provide NGOs with the exibility to connect Avni’s data with a wide range of destinations, including databases, data warehouses, and analytics platforms supported by Airbyte.
My progress:
I started  with exploring the Avni platform, Siddhant introduce me with Avni channel and I asked my doubts there and asked for any help related to Avni on that channel. Avni is an open source platform for on field service and data collection. Started with creating forms and eventually got  familiar with Avni platform.
With a solid understanding of Avni, I then turned my attention to Airbyte, an open-source data integration platform. Airbyte simplifies the process of collecting, transforming, and loading  data from multiple sources to various destinations.
Then started with building connector, After exploring the Avni and Airbyte platforms, I decided to build the Airbyte connector for Avni using the Python SDK. Till now I have implemented the subject stream functionality. In Avni, a subject represents an entity for which data is collected. This could be a patient in a healthcare system or a student in an educational institution. Pulling subject information from Avni and transforming it into a format compatible with Airbyte was the primary objective of this implementation.
One of the hurdles I encountered was figuring out the authentication process for the Avni API. Since the Avni API utilizes AWS Cognito for authentication, the traditional Airbyte token authenticator method wouldn’t work. I spent considerable time grappling with this challenge, trying to find a solution that would allow me to authenticate the API. I thoroughly examined the core code of the Airbyte token authenticator. To my surprise, I discovered that the method I had been using was actually deprecated. However, even after exploring the new method, I found that it didn’t offer a viable solution for my specific needs. And at last finally come up with a solution by overriding the existing method.
The major lesson I learned from this experience is that sometimes the solution can be simple, but finding it can be challenging. It taught me the importance of perseverance and exploring different approaches as an integral part of the problem-solving process.
What next :
Moving forward, my next steps involve implementing additional streams to ensure seamless usability for Avni users. This will be followed by incorporating incremental sync functionality, writing comprehensive unit tests, and documenting the entire process to enhance the connector’s reliability and accessibility.
I want to thank Siddhant for providing me with this opportunity, as well as his ongoing suggestions and efforts to keep things flawless.Title: From the Field Visit with Jan Sahas in Dewas – By Tejas Mahajan

Category: Tech4Dev 2.0

==================================================

Date: 7th, 8th November 2023
Jan Sahas
is an NGO that works for two major causes, support for migrant workers (MRC abbreviation used internally) and prevention of violent crimes against women and children (PVAWC). The visit was aimed at understanding the PVAWC vertical for the fractional CxO arrangement they have ongoing with Project Tech4Dev.
At a high level PVAWC serves two major functions, i.e.
Prevention,
under which the team does work with the community to set-up safe spaces for women and children of the community to educate themselves and equip with tools to fight such crimes and on the other hand is the
Response Rehabilitation Reform
work which is important and crucial to the survivors of such crimes.
The organization and work is scaled to about 78 districts where there is strong ground presence and operations like identification of cases, fact finding, support to the survivors and the family in form of legal assistance, mental health support, preparation for the trial, accessibility to the benefits and compensations and so on.
A survivor case in best case usually takes anywhere between 1-3 years to come to a conclusion with compensation being provided to the victims, and still the rehabilitation work of the team continues to help survivors overcome the sense of trauma and blend in the normality of life. Each ground team tracks the journey of each of the cases manually by maintaining meticulous notes and following the system of logging details of each case in ledgers for future use and reference. Navigating cultural, social and political pressures in the society as well as the fear and mistrust from the survivor families.
Context of the Field Visit: Jan Sahas team is looking to digitize the work being done through the vertical and the onground team members, so as to reduce the time spent by ground staff in duplicating or triplicating the handwritten notes from one ledger to another, as well as to drastically improve the reporting of work done to the donors as well as to the larger organization itself. Another outcome of a digitized system could be the potential of cross learning between multiple districts and the immense value consolidated data of field notes from response to violent crimes against women and children can inform the future policies and laws.
Day 1: Immersion and Discovery
We arrived at the office at 10pm and were promptly greeted and taken to the first meeting with the mid-managerial staff, where we were introduced to the heads of clusters who have overseen the delivery of this program for more than 7 years on average. We learned the nuances of how the present team is structured and the problems being faced in reporting to funders under the present structure and systems.
Ankit also demonstrated a quick prototype of an envisioned app for the cluster coordinators to take a look and share any initial feedback and suggestions.
We witnessed the helpline and staff that anchors the helpline. We learned the process they follow to answer queries and deal with emergency situations that come their way.
A team member engaged in conversation over the helpline
Post lunch we visited a stakeholder office One Stop Centre which is a facility by Govt of India made specifically for women who are seeking refuge from domestic violence. We had an insightful conversation with the Woman Empowerment Officer who gave us a lay of the land, the kind of cases that come up and the challenge involved in dealing with such cases. Jan Sahas seemed to have a very cordial fruitful rapport with the local administrator.
Post this we were driven to the field office outside of Dewas called the Resource Centre. This is the main hub of activity where the case workers, district coordinators, field counselor and other support staff work. We spent a good 1.5 hours interviewing them, understanding the work they do, the nuances involved, the challenges that they face, their previous experience with using technology and many more such details.
A pic of some of the registers/ ledgers the team maintains which contains similar information
Through this meeting we understood the process involved for the field team to respond to violent crimes, the day to day and the journey of a case. Through this conversation we were able to discover that there have been attempts to introduce an app which was failed which has created a sense of doubt to any technology, and that field workers keep track of a single case across multiple ledgers over any given period of time and reducing this work is a potential value add that they will look forward to.
We ended the day by making plans to visit the local temple early in the morning.
Day 2: Going deep in the field
We started the day bright and early. Did a mini trek to the local temple and had ourselves a good local breakfast.
Picture of the local temple famously called as tekdi
We then set out for a day of going deep into the field of the office, meet some of the survivors, have deeper conversation with the district coordinator accompanying us to really understand the process and purpose of each of the ledgers being maintained in order to get an essence of the documentation, what can be digitized and what is best left as is.
We visited 3 survivor families, as a routine part of the follow up. All three families were supported in the past, whose cases were resolved and compensation done. These families had great respect for the visiting Jan Sahas team and as a result treated us with equal respect and affection to invite us in their abodes and offer us tea and fruits.
We also visited a Dignity Centre in one of the remote villages, this comes under the prevention vertical. The dignity centers are anchored by a member of the local community, who is recruited as a part time Jan Sahas team member. Their work is to set up baal or balika panchayats, constituting 20-30 adolescents from the village. These dignity centers and the panchayats provide a platform for the local children to learn about the rights, the tools, and educate themselves about gender, violence and legal aspects of these things. Apart from this, a major focus of these centers is to develop the leadership and citizenship skills of the kids who are a part of it.
A picture of the entry to Dignity Centre we visited
We also visited another local administration office – called the woman and child friendly police station, another one of the government initiatives being supported by Jan Sahas team. The police station room outside the police station and away from the usual melee inside a station is to provide a safe and comfortable place for the survivor to report the incident and seek help and protection.
The police station is one of the main sources of leads to Jan Sahas team to identify the cases to support.
Key Learnings:
Field team works dedicatedly on the ground and their success at the moment is not hindered by the presence or absence of a tech solution
The field team is doubtful of a tech solution mainly because they do not want to see their meticulous notes on the cases disappear because of a glitch or a crash.
Field team does notes taking in different ledgers, and is super data and process oriented. But it is a major pain point for them to add the same notes 5-6 times in different ledgers to follow the process
The field team is fairly well versed in the use of technology.
Reflections:
There are a diverse range of activities being undertaken by the field team, data from some of them is more critical than others. It is worth considering a strategy to start by digitizing a low consequential process, in order to build the trust of the team, get them used to the technology, as well as for the implementing and developing team to learn the necessary skills to adopt.
The evaluation of any tool or system being adopted will depend on how flexible it is to allow making changes to the processes, with very less dependency on developers of the system.
A very objective Why to adopt the tech solution or in other a very objective value add will have to be articulated for each level of the organization to rally behind and implement the system in the long run.
Gratitude
Deep appreciation to the entire Jan Sahas team, Ms Reena and district coordinators who took us around, and answered each of the questions we posed at them patiently to help us understand the ongoing processes.
Very few times in life does one feel like Yes, my faith in humanity is restored. Seeing the work of Jan Sahas, observing the team do their thing passionately, dedicatedly, seeing the smiles and relief they brought to the families of the survivors was one such rare moment.Title: Fueling Success: Antarang’s Data Breakthrough with Goalkeep and Dalgo

==================================================

This Blog is written by Jainish Patel from Goalkeep
About the nonprofit:
Antarang Foundation is a non-profit organization based in India that focuses on youth development and career guidance. Their primary goal is to empower young people, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, by providing them with the skills, education, and support necessary to make informed career choices.
Objectives and Challenges:
Antarang’s mission was clear: Senior management wanted to track the effectiveness of their programs in order to make impactful decisions to improve overall student performance. Their dashboard to monitor student growth was taking too long to load and data was not centralized.
Here are some challenges that Antarang faced:
Inability to synchronize data at frequent intervals.
Reports were created manually and shared through Google Sheets due to limitations imposed by Salesforce.
Difficulty in working with Google Sheets because of row limits.
Each data sync was a full data transfer which took up a lot of time.
Solution
:
To tackle these challenges, we first needed to pinpoint what information Antarang wanted to uncover. They had two main areas of inquiry: “Are students improving?” and “Are students mastering the endline assessment?” Through multiple discussions and interviews with the Antarang team, we broke these broad areas down to what we call Key Questions. This also involved diving deep into actions the team were planning to take and understanding the data sources available, particularly within Salesforce. Here’s a snapshot:
Once we had a clear understanding of the questions at hand, the next step was getting our hands on data. This involved setting up a robust data pipeline. We began by designing a data lineage diagram, that would structure the incoming data in a meaningful way.
Then, using Dalgo, we ingested all of Antarang’s Salesforce data and stored it in a central data warehouse (BigQuery). Dalgo facilitates incremental syncs, reducing data-sync time by pulling only those records that have been created or modified data since the last sync times. Its interface provided a clear overview of all tables available on Salesforce, allowing us to select only those we required for the dashboard. Once the data was in place, we began the process of modeling it for analysis. Here is what the Dalgo interface looks:
Through dbt, Goalkeep transformed raw data into pre-calculated tables using a set of modular and reusable blocks of code. Dalgo also enabled us to set up automated syncs (i.e. orchestration) so that end users would always be looking at the latest data.
With the data pipeline in place, it was time to bring everything together into a user-friendly dashboard. We started by designing mock-ups to visualize how the dashboard would look and function, and then build the same on Looker Studio, ensuring that it provided actionable insights to address Antarang’s key questions. Here is a glimpse of the final dashboard:
Results:
The new dashboard loads instantly and provides a strong base for creating more advanced analytics. Thanks to Dalgo, Antarang now has a tool for bringing in all their data in one place, transforming it, and managing orchestration for both existing and potential new pipelines. This process is highly scalable, as Dalgo allows data ingestion from different sources and orchestrates multiple pipelines simultaneously.
Here is some of the immediate feedback we heard when we demonstrated the dashboard to the Antarang team: Akshata Hawaldar: “The dashboard loads so quickly and looks so neat .
Kumar Arunachal: Having multiple dashboard mock-ups to choose from is such a nice experience, and receiving such a clean and beautiful looking dashboard just exceeded our expectations.
At Goalkeep, we are honored to have played a role in building data culture at Antarang by enabling seamless and scalable data consolidation. As Antarang continues to evolve, we’re excited about the brighter future it promises for youth development.Title: Fund Impact

.Title: FundImpact Update – A refined concept of the platform
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/fundimpact-update-a-refined-concept-of-the-platform/
==================================================

We have been exploring product ideas for FundImpact through an extensive user research program and have come to realization that the product concept development is a continuous exercise. In our interactions, the stakeholders would present a unique pressing need that is ‘The Solution” they have been looking for, however, the workflow for such a feature is a specific to their organization and can’t be generalized.
In our brain storming sessions for developing concept of FundImpact, we therefore, try to draw our attention to a generalized feature set that impart a proven management practice of getting things organized and done. We want features of the platform that facilitate organization in managing their projects rather than becoming another operational overhead. These overheads could be managing configuration of the platform, a workflow which requiring technical expertise, complex systems that require operational knowledge, or porting data from external systems, etc.
We have kept the consideration of being “
Flexible
” in design of the FundImpact, so that varying need of users can be addressed but at the same time we are rooted to “
Generalized
” feature set that cater off the shelf solution to a large section of our target audience.
The core concept of FundImpact is to help organizations
manage funds
,
track projects deliverable
and
report impact
“. These are the three pillars of FundImpact that would facilitate organizations in streamline workflows and help adopt a good practice, thereby saving time, effort and money.
Core Solution of FundImpact
Management by Objectives
“Management by objectives” or MBO is a management approach coined by Peter Drucker in 1950s and later Hewlett Packard led to its popularity
[
link
]
. It is the process of defining
specific objectives
within an organization that management can
convey
to organisation members, then deciding how to
achieve
each objective in sequence.”
They key concepts of MBO are:
Review organizational goal
Set objective
Monitor progress
Evaluation
We are designing digital workflows of FundImpact that are rooted to MBOs. The organization will deliberate upon
Goals
and
Objectives
that they would like to achieve through the project being sponsored by Donor. The ‘O
bjectives
‘ would translate into
Deliverable
(the core activities project will deliver) and
Impact
(results of these deliverable). The organization would be systematically ‘
Monitor progress’
of
Budget expenditure
and Deliverable achieved and ‘
Evaluate’
the impact that the project is bringing on ground.
A snapshot of Project Dashboard
A project dashboard gives a snapshot of critical indicators of the project. It displays Fund Status, Project Achievements, Impact Indicators and Geographic Coverage of the project along with some basic information about the project. The
card layout
allows the user to modify the presentation of the dashboard. This conveys broader objectives and progress of the project to various stakeholders in the organization.
A
tabular view
gives a detailed information of the three important components of the project i.e. Project Budget, Project Deliverables and Impact. It presents the targets vs actual position of various indicators along with requisite documents such a FUC, Field Reports, Fund receipts, etc.
The three core features of the platform are explained in the following sections
Fund Management
The Budget Tracker or Fund Tracker on the platform allows the users to keep track of
overall budget of the project
. It gives a status of original budget allocated and budget spent till date under various line items and heads. The budget tracker is not intended to be used for tracking individual expenses or replace any accounting or expense reporting tool.
Its purpose is to give a
snapshot of the budget remaining
for the project under various components or heads.
Deliverable Tracker
The Deliverables tracker allows the organization to report high level progress of the projects based on the deliverable set in the MoU. These are not intended to be operational level tracking of ongoing processes and achievements of the project, but rather achievements/objectives as stated in the Project Charter or MoU.
Impact Reporting
The Impact Indicators are the cornerstone of the FundImpact. They help organization report the impact of their programmes using standard impact library developed by FundImpact. The organization can also create their own set of impact indicators and link to the Sustainable development goals.
End note
Its has been a great learning experience interacting with various stakeholders who giving their insights and ideas about the platform. We would recommend you to visit our first blog on original concept of the FundImpact

In our earlier blog, we shared the conclusion of User Research program, which gave us a broader
wishlist of features
that can be prioritized in the Product Roadmap. In this blog, we shall explore the process that we evolved in managing Product ideas during the User Research program. Another purpose of writing this blog is to aggregate links to original documents and findings of the user study at one place.
If you are interested in knowing how we are shuffling ideas in backlog and prioritizing features for Product Roadmap, please read our blog on
Managing Ideas for Product Roadmap
.
Step 1: Free Flow Discussion with Stakeholders
We are thankful to participants from various organizations who gave their time for this study and gave valuable insights on FundImpact from their practical ground experience. The interactions with the participants of the study have contributed greatly in shaping the roadmap of the platform.
The interaction session was kept for one hour long. The objective of keeping a short interaction session was to keep the discussion focused on high level requirements and not digress into feature details or specific problem area of the organization. Again, the objective was not to gather detailed requirements but get a better understanding of problem areas of the stakeholders, how important the issue is, what solution design does the stakeholder prupose, etc.
Another important aspect we maintained in our conversation was to keep it free flowing and not bring in the mould of FundImpact feature set. We didn’t want to ask if a particular feature or idea of FundImpact would fit their need, rather we wanted to know more about how problem they are facing and what kind of solution they are thinking of.
Checklist of User Interaction
Keep the interaction short and focused
We are not capturing detailed requirements gathering
Agenda should be to capture problem areas and stakeholder’s perception about solution
Don’t restrict stakeholders to validate your own ideas of product, let them share what they think about the solution
Have a list of questions ready that help you facilitate the discussion and lets the stakeholder explore/contemplate about solution
Make sure you capture rough notes of the conversation for later reference
Step 2: Finalize Notes of each interaction
I extensively use Onenote to capture rough notes or meeting notes for any such interaction or simply dropping ideas, tasks or web links. It is a great tool and brings in a lot of discipline to work. I prefer this over any To Do list, Reminder Tool, Quick Notes, Sticky Notes or Google Docs because of sheer ease and accessibility. You can also try similar note taking apps Evernote, Notion.so, Coda.io.
We interacted with stakeholders from six organizations working in different sectors and at different operational scale. The detailed notes for each interaction can be accessed via following links. Please note that we have removed names of organization and stakeholder due to privacy concern.

Step 3: Prepare a Jamboard of Feature Ideas
The detailed notes are extremely important when original conversation needs to be referenced back for further researches. However, they are not so handy format during team discussions and finalizing features during sprint planning.
We have setup a process to synthesize these long notes into more manageable form during our Product Roadmap discussions. We try and identify the common elements of these features and label then under a feature category or module. Labeling or naming the features help us build a common vocabulary of the Product Roadmap and team members can easily recall the scope of a feature being referred. For example, team now has a better understanding of what a Donor Communication Management entails and how it is different from Donor/Proposal lead management.
For each of the conversation, we have created a Jamboard to populate and label all important features/modules.
Sticky notes used to create a Wall of Features using
Google Jamboard
.
Step 4: Comparative Analysis of Feature Ideas from Stakeholders
Finally we brainstorm to conduct a comparative analysis of feature ideas proposed by stakeholders and how much they are relevant for other stakeholders. This exercise helped in evaluating the criticality of the feature ideas and how badly are they required across the board.
Now, we stand with a refined list of feature ideas that is prioritized as per stakeholders needs and can be included in the final version of the product roadmap.

==================================================

The User Research Program is opening up new dimensions for FundImpact. With each discussion, we are gaining useful and practical insights on features that will help organizations in efficiently managing their funds. We do understand that the participants in the user study represent a wide spectrum of audience working in different sectors and at varying operational scale, and therefore the scope of platform is getting wider. We are trying to find a balance on how
flexible
a feature should be so that organization can adapt its workflows without compromising on any data point or investing management overheads in maintenance. At the same time we are trying to keep the features
generic
, so that a large section of the target audience can adopt good practices available via off the shelf features.

The platform holds a lot of potential in serving the most pressing needs of the organizations. Currently, NGOs struggle with different systems serving their own specific purposes of accounting or project tracking. These systems have their own user management, data structure, reporting formats, technology stacks, etc. that makes it even harder for the teams to track projects across different business aspects (finance, operations, compliance,etc.).
Data Interoperability and Integration with existing systems is crucial for successful implementation of FundImpact in any organization. The platform with its own unique feature will end up working in silos and create additional processes in maintaining data flow across business verticals and systems. In our experience of having developed solutions for hundreds of organizations, we have realized that a custom solution that is handcrafted to serve a specific purpose and has tailor made workflows, would eventually fail to reach its intended objectives due to integration issues. The organizations are rapidly evolving and need systems (no matter how tailor made they were) to adapt with changing needs.
In this blog, we capture our thoughts on the future of FundImpact and possible pathways for the Product Roadmap. We explore various aspects that can help ease the adoption of FundImpact and organically evolve the technical features with the changing organizational needs.
Building Blocks vs Integration
There are two approaches to expand the feature of the FundImpact. The first approach is to offer building blocks which help NGOs perform their operations related to Fund, Project Tracking and Impact Reporting. These building blocks are pre-requisites for an organization to perform these three core processes.
For example, an NGO would need to maintain its donor database before it could use FundImpact, or they have a requirement to manage the proposal or grant pipeline before they could manage projects on FundImpact. Even utilities like bulk importing of data from legacy systems is a critical building block.
The building blocks serve minimal viable features and are not intended to reinvent the wheel. They are useful for organizations that do not have systems in place and can rely on these blocks/modules to have a seamless experience in managing their projects.
The second approach is of Integration. We want to repurpose existing systems and digital workflows as much as we can. This approach shall make FundImpact a versatile solution that leverages existing IT infrastructure of the organization and ensures data interoperability and integrations.
The system will have Data APIs to push and pull data from other systems. We are also thinking of creating integration modules with some of the most popular Apps and Systems being used by NGOs such as survey tools, accounting tools, donor CRM, etc.
Wishlist of Features from User Study
In our User Research program we interacted with stakeholders from six social purpose organizations working for different causes and at different scale of operations. Out of these, one organization had a very particular mode of operation and purpose, hence we kept its requirements as edge case and didn’t include in this study.
The final result of our user study program is the Comparative Analysis of various requirements suggested by the participants of the study. This list will help in prioritizing the backlog of features to be developed. You can access the result

Comparative Analysis of Feature Requests from User Study Participants. (
view here
)
In the following sections, we briefly describe functionality of various features and what issue they address of the stakeholders.
Donor CRM :
Managing Donor database along with the Donor Contact Details. The feature should allow managing communication history with the donor and record next action/request from the donor. The feature should also allow prospecting Donors and manage the new donor leads.
Proposal Management:
Managing project proposals via a sales pipeline like feature. It allows teams to manage proposals across multiple stages. A donor may have multiple projects with the organization or multiple donors may be supporting a particular project.
Contracts Management:
Managing various project contracts being undertaken by the organization for easy retrieval during project closure, audit and compliance activities. The feature would allow organizations to track updates in contract as addendum, modifications, etc.
Budget Negotiation Tracker:
Some of the organizations have mentioned that the negotiation on budget approval is an integral part of their project proposal. The organization would like to have a workflow for managing budget negotiations. Although we don�t seek much adoption of this feature among larger audience.
Compliance Management:
This module allows setting up business rules that presents either a checklist which users can manually verify or system rules to verify compliances on documents, procedures, reporting timelines, etc. The module will ensure that organization is adhering to a set of pre-defined compliance rules while uploading the data and following a particular schedule of reporting, fund disbursal, statutory reporting, etc.
Smart System Alerts:
Complimentary to Compliance management is the Smart Alerts which send reminders to the team manager to conclude a task as stipulated in the project MoU, activity schedule, or request from donors or statutory authorities. It can also help teams set business rules to keep track of project related achievements such as alert on not completing a project activity at defined schedule, offshoot in project budget, tapping on budget variances, etc.
Planner (Activity and Budget):
This feature is important for organizations who would like to forecast their budget expenditure based on targets set during annual planning. The module allows you to set the Targets for the year and forecast budgetary requirements. It can also be used for tracking the target vs actual and report deviation/course correction measure.
Project Tracker / MIS / Survey Tool:
Different projects have different data capturing requirements and therefore one tool can�t cover all aspects of data collection for Project Tracking. The purpose of this module is to give a bare minimum feature set for online web based data collection (something similar to Google Forms).
Team Task Tracker:
It is a PM or Todo List feature that would allow team members to keep track of the tasks assigned to them, and ensure the activities that they are performing are tied to project deliverables, responsibilities are well distributed and communicated to all, members are aware of the deadlines, etc.
Team Management (Organization Organogram):
This feature can be considered as an extension of the HR tool. Some of the organizations have requested that they would like to assign the members of the organization to certain projects and track their activities/performance/compensation accordingly. The system should provide feature to build up organizational organogram and assign team members to various features/modules/projects on the platform. For example,  Creating user hierarchy based on team structure,  Program structure, Geography, etc.  (District Coordinator/State Coordinator, State wise team, national team, education team, training team)
Project Expense Tracker:
Feature to allow ground team members to report project related expenses, upload receipts and tag them under appropriate budget heads. It facilitates the team members and finance managers in tracking project expenses at ease (and don�t have to be worried about lost receipts, scanning of receipts, etc.)
Theory of Change Designer:
Some of the organization have proposed using a log frame to design their project deliverables and track them in this particular format. A log frame allows the organization to set targets for Input and output activities and measure its result as outcome or impact. A log frame is a widely used approach in social sector for managing projects that deliver concrete results.
Document/Knowledge Management:
This feature facilitates organizing of various documents, receipts, contracts, project reports, statutory documents, etc. to be categorically organized for easy retrieval and ensure adherence to compliance. This feature will ensure appropriate access control in the organization and ensure privacy and confidentiality measures are taken on sensitive information. The feature can also archive and remove access control to team members on certain data items (such as donor list, beneficiary list, project expense reports).
Managing Sub-Granting:
Some of the organization collaborate with 3rd party agencies and local partner organizations to implement a project. This feature would allow subletting of certain activities or project deliverables and allow the parent organization in managing these aspects. The partner agencies can also get access to certain features on the platform to report back their assigned tasks, budgetary expenditure, etc.
Donor Dashboards (reporting):
This feature would allow Donors to get access to a dashboard to track in real time the progress of the projects they are supporting.
Donor Related Features:
The feature would give a donor counterpart of the FundImpact platform. They�ll have donor specific workflows in adding new organizations, managing projects, tracking budget expenditure, reporting across sectors, geography, organizations, etc.
Accounting Tool:
This feature would be a bit ambitious. We can think of giving basic double entry system to capture journal entries, create chart of accounts and produce Balance Sheet and Cashflow reports. The idea is not to cover any advance accounting feature or taxation features on this feature/utility
Integration with Survey Tools:
Providing ETL layer to some of the popular survey tool such as Dhwani�s MFORM, Survey CTO, Collect platform to fetch and tag survey data to appropriate project trackers and dashboards.
Integration with Accounting tools like Tally:
Tally is one of the most popular accounting tool in India. The feature would allow integration with tally to fetch aggregated data and tag them to various project budgets. The idea is to avoid any duplication of efforts in data entry and maintain a single source of truth.
Stay tuned for more updates on the FundImpact User Research Program. In the next blog, we’ll write about the process and detailed notes of this program.Title: FundImpact – List of agile tools to manage Development Plan

==================================================

Imagine a dream of embarking an adventurous journey to a remote island in Indian Ocean for hidden treasure. You have traveled enough islands, experienced enough waters, that you feel tired to give up your journey. But at last you stumble upon the treasure that can change your life forever. That’s how I felt when I discovered an amazingly feature rich platform to manage IT projects. I know it is bit dramatic, but I got joyful to discover this platform and how simple it makes to manage sprints and product delivery.
This is not a paid promotion of the product (although the referral link would help us gain an extra mile). I am sharing a product review to let people know that there are amazing tools beyond JIRA, Asana, Trello, etc. to manage your IT projects.
What’s out there in the market?
The most widely used tool for large scale IT projects has to be Atlassian’s JIRA. It offers a whole suite of application from ticketing to product wiki. People also use Trello or Asana which offers them good flexibility in tracking
just what is needed
. I have tried categorizing these tools into two broad heads
Agile Management Tool
– These are tools are tailor made for agile development, and one can’t use it for non-IT projects.
Project Management Tool
– These are generic PM tools which focus on tasks to track project progress.
Below, I present a decent list of tools that I have discovered so far. Please feel free to suggest more tools in the comment section below.

Note:
I have not reviewed all the tools in the above list. I am sure some of them would be as good as the one we have decided to use for our context. The list is for reference purpose so that readers of this blog can discover and explore tools themselves.
What suites our need?
After evaluating a handful of tools, we have finally decided to give
ClubHouse.io
a long shot. I particularly like how neatly it is designed and gives a good workflow to those who are new to agile methodology.
Developers and Managers who are familiar with Agile Methodology would find this as a complete package with Burndown charts and other reporting tools that can ease the management aspect and bring all the team members on one page.
The crux of any Agile Tool are
Stories
and how you are able to organize these Stories into Epics, Themes, Iterations, Projects, Releases, etc.
Stories can be further broken down into
Tasks
. The tasks can be promoted into stories. The tasks allows the developer to write down aspects of tech module that she or he needs to work to deliver the complete functionality under the story.
Epic
is a collection of stories. It represents a broader functionality or feature set that requires many modules to work together.
Milestones
: We are using milestones to manage product release cycles. One can assign epics to the milestones and group functionality that needs to developed and released at particular point in time.
Iterations
: Iterations or Sprints are a series of planned work cycles that help you prioritize stories and deliver product functionality in incremental mode without loosing focus from priority list and product timeline.
The wonder box in this tool has to be
Projects
and
labels
. The projects and Labels act like meta tags to categorize various Stories in a more logical grouping. You can group all the stories under API project or FrontEnd or Dashboard projects. This can also help various teams to manage stories which are relevant to them and also see the bigger picture of how their work contributes to the success of sprint and product release.
The projects can have customized workflow (Kanban workflow) to manage stories based on their context. For, example the team can have Knowledge Week to upskill themselves. The stories in such sprint would have a different workflow than the development sprint.
There are tons of other functionalities that make this tool an ideal candidate for our context. I hope this blog gave you references to other tools to manage your IT projects. Please drop in your suggestions on this blog post or new IT tools in the comment section below.Title: FundImpact – Product Roadmap FAQs
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: March 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/fundimpact-product-roadmap-faqs/
==================================================

Vision
of the Platform
What is the larger purpose of the Platform?
The larger purpose
of the FundImpact is to empower organizations in addressing the transparency
and accountability with regards to Statuary compliances, Donor Awareness and
Internal Audits. It enables organizations to take data driven decision making
and measure the impact it is delivering.
FundImpact provides
off-the shelf features that are easy to implement and serves the basic needs of
the NGOs (i.e. tracking funding from Donors/Funders and tagging very high level
activities (milestones) against it.
How will the platform be positioned as compared to
bespoke platforms offering similar functionality with freemium models?
The core philosophy
of the platform is to provide free and opensource solution that is highly
modular and extensible. The organizations can use the base platform and extend
the functionality tailor made to their requirements and workflow.
The vision is not
force fit a particular workflow or data structure of the freemium solutions in
the market but to facilitate organization with core set of tools that can be
further extended to a project management tool, leads management, survey tool,
impact assessment, etc.
Will it be a complete package of ERP for NPOs?
The platform has a
very specific purpose to help organizations keep track of funding from donors
and measure activities against a set of impact indicators. The platform will be
extensible enough to plug into other solutions or applications through APIs to
perform workflow driven data entry operations or reporting. (For, example,
integration with Project Management tool to keep track of Project Activities,
Integration with Billing Apps to keep tracks of accounting)
Accounting
How do we address different accounting practices to
track funds?
FundImpact will be
shipped with Minimal Viable Features with regards to management of Funds. We
are tracking funding support at an aggregate level and not at granular level
for each bill or expense. It will give a snapshot for three main indicators –
Funds Committed by donors, Funds received by organization and Funds Utilized by
the organization for each project/portfolio.
For accounting
purposes, it is best that the organization sticks to its accounting packages
and use its APIs to integrate the FundImpact and fetch relevant data points.
Is it going to be an accounting software?
No, FundImpact is
not intended to be an Accounting package. It is helping organizations
(specially project managers and fund managers) keep track of the current status
of the projects undertaken by the organization by reporting Fund and Activity
status.
Will it integrate with accounting packages like Tally?
Yes, the platform
will be designed to fetch relevant data points from 3rd party applications. As
of now, we haven’t thought of providing off the shelf support to any of these
accounting packages.
How will it help the accounts department? They already
have a financial tools in place and extensively use Excel or Tally for their
work.
The platform is
intended to facilitate better communication between accounts/finance department
and rest of the team in the organization. The accounts personnel can upload
audited/approved numbers of funds to the platform. The same can be
accessed/tracked by the other team members through project dashboards.
The platform is not
designed to provide features for accounting workflows (like double entry system
or approvals/audits of payments/funds or budgeting). These operations can be
continued on the existing tools (like Excel, Tally)
Project
Management
How will the platform serve the difference management
practices and approaches in the organization?
FundImpact is not
designed to be used a project management tool. The product will be shipped with
Minimal Viable Features to track project deliverables as committed in the MoU
or against funds allocated.
The project managers
can use any of the 3rd party applications outside the FundImpact to assign
tasks to team members and time track their deliverables.
Is it a project management Tool?
FundImpact captures
and tracks the project deliverables and not individual members tasks. It is
therefore not designed to be used as a Project Management Tool for managers to
oversee implementation of a plan or deliverables of the individual team members.
It is more like tracker for high level project deliverables (like activities
committed under the MoU)
The platform will
give a high level dashboard of various projects categorized under different
portfolios (Workspaces) for the managers and team members to review/track where
the projects are heading. They can get a high level view of target vs actual on
Funding and Committed Activities.
Will it be a reporting tool?
In a very broad
sense, the FundImpact platform can be used a reporting tool to display high
level indicators for the project (e.g. No of centres established, No of
training camps organized, Funds received till date, Funds utilized till date,
etc)
The dashboards will
generate relevant reports at four Levels – Deliverable Card (group of time
bound activities), Project, Workspaces (Portfolio) and at organization level.
Can this be used as a survey tool? Who will enter
project data on the tool?
The FundImpact is
not designed to capture survey data or enter granual details for a project
activities. It is intended for the project managers to enter the aggregated
details of the project activities (the target deliverables of the project, like
no. of health camps organized).
Will this act like a document repository for the
projects?
The FundImpact
captures the high level indicators of a project for tracking purpose. It is not
intended to be used as document repository for various projects in the
organization. Although we can upload attachments as reference documents.
Will this tool serve like a contracts management for
the organization? (Managing and monitoring contracts/MoU)?
Contracts management
is workflow driven application which requires custom logic and approach to
manage various leads and prospect projects. The FundImpact is not intended to
be used for prospecting projects or donors.
Impact
Measurement
How will we measure impact?
The high level
indicators captured through activities (deliverables) gives us primary data to
evaluate impact of a particular project or activity. The organization can tag
multiple indicators to such activities as probable outcomes/impact. For,
example a project activity of “Organizing 
WASH campaigns” can be tagged with the impact indicator of health,
school education.
This way
organization is able to keep track of various impact areas it is able to work
on and are measured through (target values of activities and allocation of
funds.) For example, Dashboard will give an overall figure to the organization
like “Investments influencing child health”, “No. of villages
where SDG4 was addressed”.
In our approach,
Impact Measurement should be taken as portfolio management across most common
indicators of various projects.
What impact framework will we be using? Can the
organization create their own?
The FundImpact
doesn’t propose any impact framework. Rather it supports capturing of primary
data and categorizing the data into relevant form before the organization can
process it using any of the impact frameworks. The FundImpact facilitates the
aggregation and structuring of the data as per organization’s strategy and
requirements by allowing them to categorize/tag project activities into
attributable impact indicator.Title: Github Badges: How it fulfills Glific�s need
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/github-badges-how-it-fulfills-glifics-need/
==================================================

GitHub badges, a consolidated way to present concise pieces of information about a project. These badges help in increasing the readability of the readme file because they provide metrics about the repositories that help the readers to get a clear idea of the repository very quickly just by scanning the attached badges.
For
Glific
, we�ve added badges. Let�s have a look at what was our expectations and how ti helped us to achieve it.
What we needed
For an open-source project, the readme should be sufficiently readable so that anyone can have a look at the readme and have a quick glance at the project. The badges can provide the following metrics:
How can someone contribute to the project?
This will help in attracting the right kind of contributors to our open source project.
It will help to attract the investors as well by giving them more confidence about the product.
Making sure the new contributor is not breaking any existing functionality.
What is the frequency of maintaining the project?
The level of code/test coverage?
Whether the project is documented well?
For an open-source project, the readme should be more readable so that anyone can have a look at the readme and it should provide the users with a quick way to collect metrics about the repository.
How it helped or can help to achieve the expectations.
These badges provide information simply and quickly.
As it is visually appealing as well to the visitor, it will help to attract the right contributors as well as the sponsors/investors.
Provide a quick overview of the quality of the product, how/who is maintaining it, what are the best practices we are following so that the new contributor can maintain that sanity as well.
The badges that we have added to the
Glific repositories
to cover several topics and areas. Starting with the license of the project, the list is below.
License
Public repositories on Github are often used to share open-source software.
So the question is, how we can say that our repository is truly open-source
?
For a repository to be truly open-source, we’ll need it to have a proper open-source license. In that way, the others are free to use, change, and distribute the software. A good way to catch the user’s attention to the license is by creating a badge. There are many ways to include badges about license and I found
shields.io
as the easiest. You can simply create the badge you want by filling the relevant details there. You can visit
https://shields.io/category/license
for more information.
Continuous Integration
As we are using the
GitHub workflow
for CI, we use the status badge as the Continuous Integration badge. You can have a badge for each of your GitHub Actions CI workflows.
For the significance, it shows whether the code changes are integrated and tested well before merging to the master branch. This will ensure that any new changes are not breaking the existing functionality.
Code coverage
The code coverage is an important thing to It displays the code coverage and test coverage of the project.
The code coverage can be generated locally, but for an open-source project, it is recommended to automate it so that it will show the updated coverage all the time. For that, we have integrated
codecov.io
in CI so that, every time the CI runs, it generates the latest coverage report and update it to
codecov.io
and we�ve access the coverage data from there itself.
Hex
The
Glific documentation
is generated and hosted using Hex. The badge shows the version of Hex we are using for Glific.
Conclusion
As we can see the badges are giving a quick way to collect metrics about the repository. These were the few badges we have included till now, there are a lot of other relevant badges as well that we can include as the project grows such as
Github issues
,
Chat (for discord)
,
Size
,
Downloads
and many more. You can check all of these out on
shields
.io
or

Key Education Foundation
Oh the joy of waking up to pitter patter! I can never get tired of the sound of rain, even when it is incessant. I must admit the weather forecast predicting rain throughout the week got me doing a little happy dance before leaving for Dehradun.
As this was our second sprint and we were all fairly aware of each other’s work, we spent some time everyday discussing our own work with
Glific
and calling out challenges within the support group. I found this circle to be very helpful and reassuring, also creating a segue for multiple conversations with fellow participants and allowing room for new ideas.
Yesterday when Abhishek asked me for one word to describe tech4dev, I said collective and I think its just wonderful how everyone is not always thinking of just a feature for one but how can you really create something that can be adopted in multiple use cases and contexts. We started Day 2 with Nadeem and Vinitha from team Sneha presenting their work in the morning along with Vinod highlighting their work on Data for the organisation.
While walking to get my third cup of coffee for the day (thanks to the
Glific
team for the french press this time) before my next session, Rishi from
Quest Alliance
asked me what Id like for him to focus on in his talk on conversation pedagogy and on my way back up, GP (Gautam Prakash) from
Reap Benefit
checked in on what kind of data we collect to make better connections to different use cases during his talk with Akhilesh on the location mapping feature they were going to present to us today.
Rishis talk on conversation pedagogy was very interesting. It channeled some of our thoughts towards how one can go from Message A to Message B for a target audience. I frivolously scribbled some things in my notebook to take back to my team in Bangalore. We also had Akhilesh from
Glific
and Gautam present the progress they have made with location mapping and Frappe specifically for Reap Benefits work. I must call out that they did a fantastic job of presenting their work (even without much help from the internet) but surely some help from Abhishek aka Mr. Corporator who joined in to add essence to a particular use case they were acting out!
Writing this blog and having been in this space filled with so much energy and so many possibilities yet again, also got me thinking or rather wondering if were so caught up in running day-to-day operations that, sometimes slowing down, sitting down to actually think, tap into those ideas weve been putting away is what we dont know were losing out. Being able to express that one little break in the chain thats been bothering us but we had put them away because bigger challenges took precedence and now sharing this with the cohort knowing well that someone may relate to you and give you almost immediate next steps that may help is what makes this experience so special.
What makes the sprints even better is the picturesque location the team always manages to host them at. The green around you in this place is so calming. By this place, I mean
The Sal Woods
. Its around 6pm now and were on our way to Mussoorie and Im trying to put all the bite sized pieces of information I can place together from multiple conversations I have had in the last 2 days. Thanks to all the reflection Tejas made us consciously do, we were thinking of what we want to take away from this space right from Day 0.
Im pausing again to relish some hot chocolate at Little Llama cafe. It tasted just as good as it did 5 years back! Well I got most of them on the table to get one too! Talk about collective eh?
Im already looking forward to the next sprint. For now, Im super excited to take new ideas, possible solutions for existing challenges and a fresh batch of motivation this space has helped me brew over the last couple of days. Oh and of course, one last round of playing Exploding Kittens and terribly losing to the veteran of this game before day 3!Title: Glific Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: July 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/glific-faqs/
==================================================

A quick way to understand the possibilities of communication with WhatsApp -for-Business and Glific is to have a quick look at the FAQs.
What are the pros and cons of using WhatsApp for business for your communication requirements?
WhatsApp for business as a solution is a good way to handle your organization level conversations with your audience. However there are few advantages and disadvantages to it-
Cons:
You cannot use a group structure for conversations or send bulk messages to contacts. All conversations are 1-2-1.
If you want to message your audience, you can only do so within a 24 hour window which opens with them messaging you first. However, you can send them template messages outside the 24 hour window, which needs to be approved by WA.
WA chat method is not very effective for collecting
structured data
. Ex. you may ask your audience of the current weather expecting to hear Sunny or Rainy etc but you might receive completely disconnected responses like depending on the chat context and their understanding.
WhatsApp for business API incurs a cost for sending each message.
Pros:
It allows you to send your message/content to a large scale audience. You can send rich media content with images, videos, emojis, and formatting.
It provides an available channel to receive response, hence setting up a two-way communication between you and your audience.
You can have personalized 1-2-1 conversations.
You can have your audience OPT-IN to your no. to freely exchange messages without the limit of a 24 hours window.
You can send google form links to collect data. While it created a disconnect between the messaging app and where the data reside, it does open a possibility.
What are the benefits of using Glific?
Leveraging WA for business, Glific allows you to do the following:
You can schedule and send time-based content.
You can categorize your chats to send contextual messages/content, and prioritize when you respond to them.
You can set up automated messages to handle a common pattern of conversations. In case you have to send the same message to many different people at different times, those cases can be automated.
You can assign specific conversations to be managed by your staff members.
Handling various languages, as we continue to find better ways to build language support.
What are some of the use cases that Glific can help with?
Communications targeting a community are generally a good use case. Ex. community healthcare, or education and counselling where the beneficiaries need to seek information from time to time.
Glific helps with connecting over quick information as per the beneficiary needs or to build a long term connection with multiple touch points for a prolonged period.
Glific is suitable for use cases where your conversation can be handled through a chatbot structure.
Apart from these, well be happy to hear from you with a potential use case and find ways to support it via Glific.
What are some of the not so good cases with WhatsApp for business?
While Glific which is built on WA for business API is great to handle a large scale of communications, there are some cases which may not align for a maximum output:
Handling a user base in hundreds might not be beneficial with Glific. And you may want to do that using whatsapp groups.
Having a lot of options (more than 9) for beneficiaries to access will not find great support since indicating an option after 9 will be challenging over chats.
An unresponsive audience which means sending messages one way over longer periods of time would not be a great use case.
What makes Glific relevant despite the various limitations and challenges?
Looking at alternative solutions, NGOs would have to build their own custom application to carry out conversations over WhatsApp for both the use cases Glific offers and any other custom features.
Some of the existing applications may pose challenges for onboarding and matching the use case for various NGOs. Most of them like Telegram, ChatWoot, Twilio will have an additional threshold of onboarding the beneficiaries onto these platforms.
On the other hand, the 24hr window for sending a session message to beneficiaries isnt that big a concern as many workflows can be created to keep them engaged and to keep the 24hr window alive.
Were continuously thinking of better ways to manage the 24hr session window and keep the conversations going.
With Glific we’re also working on better ways to reduce costs for some of the indirect uses such as setup, hosting etc… as much as possible so that, the budget only applies to the most important use. Glific being an open source product is a testament to that.
Is there anything an NGO can do to know whether Glific is right for them?
Running a pilot with 30-40 beneficiaries is a good first step. The pilot can help you discover:
How similar or different are the questions asked by your beneficiaries
Identify a pattern in conversations
Try a question answer process with about 20 beneficiaries
Create an FAQ database based on your conversations
Create a set of data points you generally need to collect
These inputs can help create a right fitment between your communication needs and what Glific can offer.
Will there be options to build it further and customize Glific to a specific NGOs needs?
Definitely. Glific is open source and the way were building the platform right from the beginning, organizations will have options to customize and build features into it for the specific use cases. It will also support webhooks and APIs to integrate any other applications.
Can you create or continue to use groups for conversations?
WA for business API now does not support group functionality anymore. It was supported earlier, and has been discontinued starting July 8, 2020.
NGOs wanting to use two-way chat platforms will have to orient their conversation structure and communication workflow to match with the 1-2-1 model.
It could be a good sign for many use cases avoid the issue spams and losing connects. Also in many cases for using groups, the admin itself would be driven out by the members since knowing the admin and their credibility gets difficult as time passes and the group grows.
Are there any steps before starting Glific?
Yes, there are three steps that need to be checked off before starting with Glific since it relies on WA for business API:
You will need to get a verified facebook account to apply for the business API.
Here are some steps to do that
.
Once that is done, you need a
gupshup.com
account also, which is our current whatsapp business provider
Before that, it also helps if the org has done a small pilot project (with 20-100 users) from their personal phone or a whatsapp business account. This gives them a better idea of how they might want to structure the interaction to begin with.
Once this is done, for all alpha and beta users, we’ll setup your Glific account to use.
Documenting a use case of conversation is a good idea too.
Here’s a good example of use case created by Slam Out Loud
. It is not the only way but a good reference. You may want to still keep in mind when documenting, that you’d be catering to 1000’s of stakeholders.
Are there any good implementations we can refer to create our communication flow?
You can refer to FunDza for their brilliant literacy program (
here’s the link
).
You can also check out Arist and how they use WA for business to run course program (
here’s the link
).
What is the Technology Stack powering Glific?
Glific is currently built as two different application. The frontend and the backend exposing all the functionality via a GraphQL API. The frontend is a React application built using typescript, Apollo data graph platform and Material UI components. The backend is an Elixir + Absinthe + PostgresDB application.
What is the Glific Pricing Model? Is Glific free?
Glific is a free, libre, open source platform. As such you can download and use the codebase for free. While the platform per se is free, it is built on the WhatsApp Business API and there is a cost involved with sending and receiving messages via WhatsApp Business API. The exact cost of this depends on your Business Service Provider (BSP)
Glific today using Gupshup.io as its BSP. Gupshup rates for India are 0.1 cent (7.5 paisa) to either send or receive a session message and 0.5 cent (38 paisa) to send an HSM message. Thus for example if your NGO is in touch with 1000 beneficiaries sending/receiving 40 messages from each of them and sending 10 nudge messages to them, your messaging cost will be $90 (INR 6,750)
For the
SaaS platform
run by ColoredCow, they have not yet determined rates. Our initial guess is that for low volumes, it will be in the range of INR 5,000. For higher volumes, it will be a percentage of the messaging costs.
What languages does Glific support?
Glific is designed to have built-in support for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) from the early releases. The platform per se, does not constrain the NGO from using the language of its choice. Our goal is to add additional languages as we work with our pilot NGOs. Some of the advanced AI and ML technologies might be restricted to a smaller subset.
How does Glific track and analyze impact?
Glific does not support this in v0.4 and below. We anticipate working
What is the difference between WhatsApp, WhatsApp for business and WhatsApp Business API?
WhatsApp
is the regular communication platform available to all users, how we normally use,  for personal 121 or group communications.
WhatsApp for business
is a separate app by WhatsApp specifically for small businesses to connect with their customers easily by using tools to automate, sort and quickly respond to messages.
And lastly, WhatsApp allows medium and large businesses to use their
Business API
to build custom products on top of WhatsApp. Glific is an example of that. It runs on WhatsApp, meaning, a custom application built using Business API can interact with WhatsApp to get the relevant data, information and send/receive messages without disturbing the WhatsApp experience for the end users.
Is there a possibility of having documents/file management in WhatsApp?
By itself, WhatsApp does not have a file/document management system. Using Glific you can send documents/files/video links in a separate message. And each document will be sent as a separate message.
Can we send a message to a group or a batch of users?
The answer is yes and no both. You will be able to create groups of users in Glific and can trigger messages to all of them at once. However, these messages will go out as 121 chats, think of broadcasting a message. But you will not be able to leverage group chatting functionality here, which means users cannot chat with each other. After you send a message to a group, each user will be able to respond to your message in a 121 format.
Additionally, if there are users in the group/batch for whom the 24 hr session window is over, the message will not be sent to them.
Other than that, you can use the group message feature to send a message to multiple users in one go.
How do you send the FIRST message to users i.e how do you on-board?
After the Glific setup process, you will have a phone number that your users/stakeholders can message directly at, similar to messaging any other family or friends phone number. This will initiate a conversation between you and your users. You will be able to see their message on Glific. There are multiple ways to do this:
Your users can save your number and message like any other contact
You will also receive an optin link which you can share with your users. Click on this link to see how it will work >
Optin to Glific whatsapp
. Once this happens your users will be able to send you a message.
They can also scan a QR code to onboard to your no. and begin chatting.
You can advertise your number in many ways to get users onboarded and start a conversation.
You can share the phone number and QR code on print materials or digital communications
You can place a push button on your website which redirects users to optin link
How can you be a part of the pilot?
To be a part of Glific pilot youll need these three things:
Your use case and how you plan to use it. For what programs, the scale etc…
Your proposed workflow. See here for an example from Slam Out Loud:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQAFkDsktgk-2dUb_qOkeVZyLuObCyBql5wI3V3kT2E/edit
Details and description of any pilot experiments your NGO has done using their personal whatsapp account

You can copy
lobo@chintugudiya.org
and
abhishek@coloredcow.in
with these inputs and we can plan with you how to move forward.
Where does the engagement data such as conversations, inputs received from beneficiaries stored?
All the data is stored locally on Glific servers. All NGOs will have complete access to their data. NGOs can also host Glific on their own servers.
How do our partners and team members access the platform?
Glific supports any number of your team members and partners to login in and access the platform. We will also build an access control support, so that the NGO admin can decide the level of access each team member has.
If an NGO already has a dedicated member base, how can they be on-boarded when using Glific?
NGOs with an existing member base can advertise the phone no. where Glific will be set up along with other methods for opting in before you can send them a message. There is no feature to bulk upload or import contacts since WhatsApp only allows users to initiate the conversation to avoid spamming.
How does automated communication flows get created, does Glific team help NGOs with that?
The Glific team will support the NGOs to learn and create automated conversation flows. However, NGOs will themselves have to prepare content and create the flows.
If NGOs self-host Glific, will the upgrade path from version to version be complex as new features are added?
Since our aim for Glific is to build a great community, well try to make it as simple as possible for self-hosted platforms to adopt new updates as per the version releases.
Are SMS and IVR also supported with Glific?
Sorry, SMS and IVR are not supported with Glific. Since it is built on top on WhatsApp. SMS may be employed later on to manage the fall through cases, and if the users do not have WhatsApp.
Is there a cost for signing up for WhatsApp Business before we can start using Glific?
No, theres no cost for signing up for WhatsApp business and neither for Glific. Theres a monthly subscription fee when you go the SaaS route for the platform. And the rest of the charges are pay per use for the number of messages you exchange.
Is it possible to integrate the bot with google sheets?
Yes, in Glific, there is the concept of web-hooks that you can integrate with any data source. For common data sources like Google Sheets, we’ll have tighter built-in integration
How can we get our users to discover our bot?
There are various ways you can do that. Channelise your whatsapp groups. If you run IVR broadcasts and call centers you can certainly onboard users from there. You can also send an SMS blast to your beneficairy contacts.Title: Glific Frontend Update

==================================================

It is been three weeks since the project kick-off. It really feels great to be involved in bootstrapping another open source project along with Lobo. It definitely reminded me of good old
CiviCRM
days.
I have been primarily focusing on the frontend aspect of the project along with my team. Based on our initial research we had decided to go with
React
for the frontend. The next task was to layout the coding practices, the toolsets and shortlisting of other libraries that would constitute the project.
I feel we have made good progress and most of the technologies are finalized. Just to summarize, we will be using Typescript for the static type-checking, Redux for the state management along with redux-thunk, Jest /Enzyme for testing and the UI will be based on the
Material Design
concept.
Here are the details:
Libraries / Packages
Yarn
– Javascript/CSS package management
Babel
– JS es6 compiler
Webpack

Webpacker
– Module Bundler
React
– JS UI library

UI Design
In the first iteration, our goal is to develop a simplified user-centric interface which will be very much self-explanatory. Additionally, the user will have the ability to label the conversation, use predefined response messages and most importantly use it just like Whatsapp Web app along with an ability to send the rich text format and media.
We like the clean interface of another open source project
chatwoot
Besides this, we have been working on a boilerplate for the project and have most of the core package functioning nicely.
Looking forward for the exciting days ahead.Title: Glific Mahabalipuram Sprint – Experiments and Learnings

==================================================

Glific NGOs at Mahabalipuram Sprint
The first sprint of the year in Mahabalipuram started with long walks along the beach for me and good South Indian food. I was ready to start the sprint at 2pm on Monday, but travel brought in everyone later in the evening, than expected. The “half day travel and work right after” didn’t really jive with anyone in team. Lesson learnt for future sprints. Though thanks to Amisha and Krishna, the kick off activity boosted everyone’s spirits with positive thoughts from team members.
The first two days had internal Glific team discussions lined up. We started the very first day after the team reached Mahabalipuram, with a “Future of Glific” brainstorming session. I was part of the Dev group, and we focused on operational excellence. We do need to continue this discussion into Platform Ux excellence post sprint. The product team focused on how we could measure Glific’s impact and Biz dev group looked at scaling, this session continued the next day, and we were able to prioritize initiatives we would pick up in 2025 for biz dev and those we pushed to the graveyard. This session needed more time than planned, and was not timed well since it was the day everyone arrived. Another lesson learnt.
The next day we started early morning for a team outing of Mahabalipuram’s amazing monolith sculptures. A 2-hour long walking tour took us back into 600AD; thoroughly mesmerizing! I loved the Arjun’s Penance sculpture, it had such detail, that I could spend an hour there and not finish seeing everything. The whole day after breakfast was full of discussions with different verticals in Glific. It was quite fulfilling for me with sessions on current churn on Glific and what we could do about it, Glific Consulting direction, Accelerator Biz Dev and Marketing kick off and Dev Tech Debt deep dive. By nightfall I was ready to relax my mouth and hit the sack. Next day NGOs arrive starting 4am, something we didn’t expect and the team worked promptly to make them feel comfortable, since rooms would not be allocated until afternoon tomorrow.

It was a good NGO sprint all in all, with over 20 Glific organizations attending various tracks. I can certainly count more highlights than misses. We had AI, Data and Refresh tracks for the NGOs to choose from. Prep-work prior to the sprint ensured that the NGOs and their PoCs in each track were aware of what they wanted to achieve at the sprint in 2 days. This was our first of its kind “Maker’s Gathering” where 60-65% of the time was allocated to designing and building using the Glific platform for the AI and Data tracks. The Refresh track had a few more sessions, since the NGOs in this track were beginner users. They had either onboarded Glific recently or had not been leveraging it to its fullest. Krishna led this track along with Sangeeta and Akansha. The NGOs in this track were extremely happy at the end of the sprint, to have gained hands-on learning and support from the team. The AI and Data tracks were for all purposes the same group, though their focus for their prototypes was different. Tejas led the AI track along with Anandu and Priyesh and Gautam led the Data track with Amisha.

Kicking off the Maker’s Gathering
Refresh track in session
I got to talk to several NGOs during the two days. Waste warriors joined us from Uttrakhand. Their work on Climate Action has been inspiring for me. Their bot is used to spread awareness of their work, and they were looking at how to draw some insights from the bot onto a dashboard. Their energy and enthusiasm was contagious. They also invited the Glific team to come volunteer with them in cleaning up our beautiful mountains. Another NGO, Vipla Foundation joined us from Mumbai. They were struggling to use the bot due to bandwidth and right skillset support. We asked them to join the Refresh track, and in talking with them at lunch I realized how thrilled they were to join at the Sprint, in spite of personal challenges at home. They picked a few learnings at the sprint, and I hope they continue to join our webinars to take these learnings forward. Another NGO eVidyaloka, has been around for 14 years in the sector of engaging volunteers to teach in public schools, they built their bot for the first time, though they have been with us since 4 months. The learning in the sprint pushed them to design and create in a way that they thought would not have been possible on their own. Some of the AI track NGOs, also leveraged the prompt engineering session by Tejas, to build their bot using the new LLM UI in Glific platform. LAHI was one such NGO. They also had a need to feedback some of the information from the bot to the document repo, which Glific doesn’t support today (Looking at AI platform team!). All these NGOs had one thing in common, they had the drive to create and demonstrate their prototype. The exhibition-style demo on the last day was like a busy market, with everyone curious about what others have created. We only had 1 hour, so not all NGOs could be visited by each of the participants or Glific team members.
The Sprint end Exhibition
After the sprint, Akhilesh, Sangeeta, Aishwarya and I had late departures on Saturday, so we indulged in the local food, Dakshina Chitra Heritage Museum and Silk Saree Shopping (Akhilesh and I were spectators here). Dakshina Chitra is worth a visit if you are interested in history and art. There were handicrafts by artist across India, and we ended by buying beautiful carvings on palmtree leaves called Patta Chitra. We also saw glass work artist who gave us a demo of making animals out of a rod of glass. Extremely impressive.

Highlights
Conversations with NGOs and internal team. Learnt some inspiring and heartening stories and had some candid conversations with people that boosted my humility and trust in the values Tech4Dev and I share.
Conversations with some team members led me to believe we can aim even higher keeping our users in mind – “Get new customers to start using Glific in 2 hours instead of 2 weeks”. It’s won’t be easy, and needs problem solving in biz dev, support, tech and product, but I think the team is ready to take this challenge on.
Tejas’ experiment for makers gathering had a lot of positive feedback. It also allowed the entire team to interact with all NGOs at the same level, and didn’t put undue burden of sessions and sprint mgmt on just a handful.
The venue allowed us to enjoy the beach along with good conversations. I thoroughly enjoyed the Mahabalipuram’s history and monolith sculptures of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Though turned vegetarian 5 years ago, this time I had decided to try some seafood. Definitely enjoyed it, but it affirmed my decision to stay vegetarian. 😊
AI sharing sessions by DG (unfortunately I couldn’t attend all) was very interesting. Took me back to pure tech experimentation in my previous life.
Internal discussions that were prepped well led to good debates and outcomes, like the Customer Retention deep dive driven by Krishna, Biz dev brainstorming & accelerator kickoff for marketing and biz dev by Sneha, and dev ops deep dive by Anandu.
Our partners Social Bytes and 10xImpact joining us made the partnership stronger in my mind. They learnt from others and were able to come closer to the Glific NGOs work.
Lastly I’m amazed at how much the entire team has grown in their own role and as a group. Stepping in for others instead of watching uncomfortably. Not just a handful, but everyone is now wearing the armor of confidence (in spite of certain self-doubt brewing in within them). Some first timers that made me proud – Aishwarya was able to take several video interviews though its new to her (blog and case studies follow shortly), Sangeeta held a session on Google sheets integration with a smile and confidence. Amisha’s talk on Big query and SQL was appreciated by all NGOs. Akansha pushed herself to personally talk with everyone and learn about their thoughts on Glific platform (summary coming up soon)  and Priyesh (with support from Gautam) handled hotel logistics with finesse I could learn from.
We obviously had some misses, in terms of certain internal and external sessions that could have been planned and executed better, sprint schedule plan and hotel logistics. But overall seeing the team, I’m content and energized to aim for ambitious goals in 2025 and meet them! I do though always miss seeing the entire Tech4Dev team when we do Glific-only sprints. Looking forward to seeing the entire team at the April Sprint.Title: Glific Reporting Analytics: Making use of Google Bigquery and Datastudio
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: February 2021

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/glific-reporting-analytics-making-use-of-google-bigquery-and-datastudio/
==================================================

Glifics reporting and analytics primarily makes use of Google Suite Products (Bigquery and Datasutdio). Although I have had experience working with several open source reporting and BI tools offering 0 to full control in terms of automation, this was the first time I made use of either Bigquery or Datastudio for data management, dashboarding or reporting. I must say I was fairly surprised with the ease with which I was able to pick it up.
In terms of Bigquery, a working knowledge of SQL is all thats necessary to get around using it. With an easy to navigate UI, a familiar-looking SQL editor and a working pane that allows you to go back to all the messy queries you wrote, Bigquery is exactly like any other SQL admin tool + more. The only difficulties that you ever experience is when you have to set up a project on your console. This however is mitigated with the amazing documentation that Google provides to get you started immediately.
Bigquery SQL console
Datastudio is another great product. Even though my training as a data scientist has seen me work with programming languages offering great visualisation libraries, I always resort to using Excel when it comes to quickly drawing up charts. And Datastudio offers me exactly that – it’s just simple excel layered with options to add filters, styles, templates etc to convert your sheets into good looking real-time dashboards. I love how Datastudio connects to any datasource whether it be your offline CSV files, Google Forms, Google Sheets, your MySQL server etc. and how it allows you to blend them together to visualise multiple datastreams within the same view. It’s very flexible to work with. The visualisations available within Datastudio however are fairly limited (charts, tables, time series – excel stuff) and if you need to use fancier visualisations, you will have to rely on the charts made available by the open-source community within Datastudio.
Snapshot of Datastudio reports
My work at Glific has involved talking with social impact organisations about their monitoring and evaluation needs and best incorporating them within our reports and dashboards. At times, when I was asked to extract nested fields or to convert JSON objects for workflows into tables that can be visualised, I was able to easily query views for these use-cases using Bigquery and connect them with Datastudio to visualise. Adding new data requirements, modifying and updating fields, building new report pages or downloading dashboards for external consumption are all possible using these two tools.
An example of visualisations within Datastudio
Over the course of my involvement at Glific, I have seen how these two tools have unlocked the monitoring and evaluation use-cases for NGOs who have often come to us to embed a new feature request or to co-create analytics solutions to enhance their outreach efforts. It’s been extremely fun working alongside them on these use-cases and standardising them for use by all other NGOs.Title: Glific  Setting up the right foundation

==================================================

The strength of a building is heavily influenced by its construction process. Planning and plotting of the site determine its fitment with the terrain and the society. Well, it?s the same for software too.
Like buildings, the foundation of software determines its longevity and adaptability in the world. To sustain, it should be able to cope up with the needs of the people it is built for. And for that, the base work needs to be solid.
A recap of the first month which had been the most crucial time for us. Everyone had a single target to work on:
Starting It Right
. Like any other project, Glific too had a lot of abstract areas and the team not knowing where to begin.
Here?s what we did to overcome these challenges.
Devising a process
We knew that each phase of the project has several unknowns. Be it requirements, research, design, tech, processes, tools, customers,? everywhere. Breaking down complex items into smaller pieces helped to set a direction and get the
action items
ready.
The first step was to set up a process to tackle these unknowns. A communication channel and regular team meetings were set up to keep everyone in sync and foresee anything going off track.
Conquering abstraction
After breaking down the areas of abstraction, the teams were ready to work on all the unknowns.
Content team targeted the following:
Documenting requirements
A clean and detailed requirement
will guide the team on what to build.
Release plan
A
comprehensive release plan
setting up direction on where to begin.
The tech team worked on the following:
New frameworks, languages, and tools
Getting familiar with the
building blocks
to leverage the advanced concepts and utilizing various design principles.
Setting up best practices
Coding conventions
and guidelines will be there with the project forever. Important to have them in place from the beginning.
Planning the architecture
Both the backend and frontend teams had been rigorously focusing on shaping a robust architecture.
Integration with external services
Most of the rework is needed here if things go haywire. Flexibility to switch third-party services was the target.
Aiming for the long run
While it’s always exciting to work on new areas and deep dive into specifics, it’s important to not lose focus on the larger picture. With the following items, the team ensured we’re there for the long run.
Naming the project
Everybody wants their software to stand out from the rest. That’s why we put so much effort into getting it right.
Read the story
behind naming Glific.
Planning for community engagement
An open-source project will thrive if people find it easy to contribute.
Documentation and guidelines
were priority from the beginning.
Bringing in automation from the beginning
Be it as simple as code formatting or complex as
Continuous Integration
, reducing manual work would definitely help.
Understanding the market
Weekly demos
with the various non-profits helped to understand the accurate use cases.
It had been pretty much the first month of Glific. A lot was covered and still a lot is remaining. The team had been persistent and patient to cover this milestone through small steps.
As of now, most of the unknowns have been resolved. We’re progressing towards the first release with a strong foundation in place with the hope to contribute to a greater cause.

Alohomora
empowers young people from underserved communities to make career decisions aligning with their strengths & aspirations. Our flagship program CareerShala along with our large-scale partnerships with the Delhi government impacts 7.5L+ students.
Recently, I joined a week-long sprint (11th-15th April 2022) organized by Glific at the
ColoredCow
‘s office in Gurgaon. Through the sprints, organized at regular intervals, Glific supports NGOs in pushing their projects forward by working closely with them in person. We,
Alohomora Education Foundation
, have recently partnered with Glific to work on a specific project that aims to provide career exploration to young adults and joined the sprint to leverage the expertise of the Glific team in order to move quickly.
Experience working with the team
I had a wonderful experience at the sprint. The team is quite approachable and eager to solve any issues that I faced while building the chatbot. They provided me with a comfortable environment where I could speak my mind and share concerns about the project. The team was continuously suggesting ideas on which we can improvise the current flows. Getting the doubts solved 1:1 was the best part of the experience. Abhishek and Mohit have been quite active in following up on the progress of our work. Constant support on ideating, structuring, and building the bot through the teams expertise helped in pushing forward the project in a much faster way. Overall, the work that would have otherwise taken many back and forth conversations over meet and discord got done in days. Not only that, I also learned new ideas that I am going to implement in the chatbot.
Opportunities to network and collaborate
I also had an opportunity to present Alohomora Education Foundations work with the entire Glific team and other NGO participants. Through the discussion, multiple ideas were generated on how we could automate part of our offerings. The sprint also provided a great opportunity to network, collaborate and learn what other non-profits are working on and find ways of working together. I thoroughly enjoyed talking to Gautam from
Reap Benefit
on ways to enhance the user experience by putting better content and navigation. My interactions with Gayatri and Shruti from
Hyperverge Academy
have led to new possibilities for working together for finding the right set of applicants for their program. I had an insightful conversation with Lobo on how to build a stronger bot vs scaling an average product.
My only suggestion for the Glific team would be to do an intro with everyone on the team and other participants early on in the sprint. The last-minute Intro provided less room for collaboration and understanding each other beyond work.
Overall going to the sprint was a huge benefit not only to the organization but also to me. I got to make connections with people on the Glific team and found a new office space to work from in the future. I highly recommend people sign up for the sprint and get in-person support to accelerate the progress on their bot. Glific team is quite warm and welcoming to all sorts of ideas at work.
Last but not the least, conversations about work and life over coffee with everyone was fun! Looking forward to joining more sprints in the future.Title: Glific Sprint: Experience of our NGO partners

==================================================

With the mission of interacting and working in person with our NGO partners, the Glific team organized a week sprint (28 Feb 2022 to 6 March 2022) in Mumbai.
We asked NGOs to put down a requirement for a specific use case that they want to tackle and wrap it up by working together with us. We got a good response from the NGOs working and operating in Mumbai.
Mukkamar
,
Bandhu
,
and
Slam out
Loud
were one of them.
It was a great experience to meet with
Jacob
from Bandhu,
Ishita
from Mukkamar
,
and
Drashti
from Slam out Loud during the sprint and work with them closely. It was surely an opportunity to understand the vision about their goals and the impact their making in society.
I connected with them to get their views on Sprint and learn from their experience and suggestion with which we can make the next sprint better.
Sharing the set of questions and their response to it below.
Were your expectations and goals for the sprint met?
Jacob
–
Yes, expectations were met and we made good progress on most of the tickets that we created for the Glific team. Other items were clarified, such as how to use webhooks, and some training was provided on what our team could do ourselves as we got more familiar with certain new/previously unknown features.
Ishita
–
Yes, the expectations were met. We had the SOW laid out, out of which we could pick and choose. What worked (because of being physically present) was to modify the expectation basis complexity. Because we dont fully understand what is easy or tough to do on Glific, we come up with super complex things to do, which the Glific team was able to simplify and break into smaller goals, which allowed for a few things to get knocked off in a couple of days. If we tried to do this ourselves, we would have taken a much longer time.
Drashti
–
We found the sprint to be really useful and what we haven’t been able to catch up on in the past 3 months, we were able to do that in a day. Looking forward to building robust systems for our programs.
How was your experience working in person? Anything specific you want to share?
Jacob
–
Very positive experience working with the Glific team, appreciated your patience and willingness to work one-on-one.
Ishita
–
I really enjoyed meeting the team in person and putting a face to the names. Since we are going to be working on this program for a long time, it really helps to be in the same room and allows for richer exchange.
Specifically, I think the last discussion, which was unplanned, around rewards and user motivation was very fruitful. Although it has not been put into action yet, it would be very useful to test with users. Often with competition and leaderboards, one has to be mindful of the disparity it creates, and hence, we think, if it works, the solution would be great for other NGOs too.
Drashti
–
In the last 3 months, Slam Out Loud (SOL) has been working with Glific for building additional features on our Chatbot to develop dashboards and organize our student data. The meeting in Mumbai was to understand the progress on the developments and share about SOL’s programs for the upcoming year to align the Chatbot services to the program needs.
We had the opportunity to discuss and work together for over 4 hours and that was very useful in identifying gaps in the dashboards and redesigning our flows to cater to program needs.
Any suggestions for us going forward.
Jacob
–
To prepare for the sprint, request that clients use a Kanban board as opposed to Google doc for submitting requests. Our doc ended up being very long and hard to track in some places. This will also help both teams scope out the time required for tasks, i.e. 3 hours per day, etc.
Also related who is responsible for which change as the ticket/task is moving through the process. A few times it wasnt so clear to me whether I was waiting on the Glific team to complete something, or if I should be waiting for my team to make some change, so that cost us some valuable time during the week. This will also help in planning; our team does daily coordination meetings and can plan better for 2 scenarios:
Before the sprint week, to plan the items that Glific will need from us to hit the ground running;
During the sprint week itself, i.e. if Glific sets up a task on Monday and follow-up is needed from our team on Tuesday
Ishita
–
My suggestions are mostly around community building and sharing. So I wouldve loved it if a couple of NGOs could have shared a meal together. Listening in to what others are doing would help everyone, and also help the Glific team, so you wont be repeating the same conversations with multiple stakeholders, assuming we all face similar challenges.
Drashti
–
Review meetings like these could be really helpful, especially in the Development Phase. We would like to thank Pankaj; he has been our go-to person for all our queries and has consistently supported us through the development process. Looking forward to the next Sprint and building robust tech systems for our programs.”
What will you tell other NGOs about the sprint?
Jacob
–
Well worth it! The sprint accelerated our development process and is helping us deploy features much faster than otherwise.
Ishita
–
Make time if you can. Dont worry about what a chatbot can and cant do, more often than not, if you imagine something crazy, the Glific team would find a way to make it possible. And l would look forward to meeting some of you in person too.
In conclusion, The sprint gave us a possibility to work closely with our NGOs partner and understand their use-case a bit better, we shared lots of stories and thoughts at the lunch table 🙂 and something to take with us as learning. We are definitely looking forward to organizing these sprints more often and connecting with our NGO partners
Thank you
Ishita
,
Jacob
, and
Drashti
for taking the time to share your experience, thoughts, and suggestions. They really mean a lot to us. We will surely learn from these and try to be better in the next sprint.
FYI: Our next sprint will be in the week of April 11th in the Delhi / Gurugram area. Let us know if you are interested in being part of the sprint.
Glific team has also shared their experience working with NGOs in these blogs. Please do give them a read as well.

==================================================

Hi everyone! My name is Calvin and Im currently a rising senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science. Ive been working with Glific as a front-end engineer intern over the past 8 weeks or so, and Ive learned a whole lot along the way. Let me tell you a little bit about my time with Glific!
How it all started
At the end of the school year, Audrey, a friend of mines in Cal Blueprint (a UC Berkeley club focused on developing software pro bono for nonprofits), mentioned this opportunity to work alongside a long-time friend of hers, Lobo. I immediately reached out to her with my interest and I scheduled a chat with Lobo to discuss what the project is all about and what my role would be with the team. It was refreshing to hear that there were other opportunities outside of Blueprint where I could once again develop software to help a variety of nonprofits, and I was incredibly excited to get started.
The technical work
Over the next couple of weeks, Lobo made arrangements for me and Cindy (another intern) to get onboarded with the Glific team and learn about the technologies that were being used. I hadnt developed with Typescript, Apollo GraphQL, Elixir, or Jest/Enzyme frameworks before, but luckily YouTube was around for me to do a little bit of self-studying. I spent the first few days of the internship watching tutorials and developing on my own and eventually ramped up to working on small tasks with the Glific platform itself. It definitely wasnt easy at first (Typescript was incredibly annoying to get used to), but over time found my footing from different examples in videos and the codebase. Now, it was time to take on the real tasks.
From this time (week 2?) to the end of the internship, I was getting started with bigger issues and taking more ownership of parts of the platform. I could see myself learning and developing quicker and smarter, and I was consistently able to learn and get feedback from my peers at our different standups. I took a lead on developing a few tasks, consisting of the server-side pagination tables, speed sends and template chat UI shortcuts, rich text editor, search functionality, and others, where the framework of different tasks became turning different back-end endpoints into usable user interfaces/features.
What worked
Through the internship, I felt like I definitely had a lot of support from the rest of the Glific team. I could always ping Kurund for better guidance through different confusing front-end tasks and Lobo whenever some back-end issues were becoming real head-scratchers. Our teams structure also allowed for a lot of flexibility as well. Since we had a couple of days or so to finish different larger tasks, it allowed me to spend a lot more time outside with family than I wouldve had working in the office. I was able to push my work schedule to later in the day (work afternoon to night) so that I could spend my mornings with my family out hiking or hanging out.
The tasks themselves were also incredibly interesting work. A lot of these tasks were functionalities I had never developed with before (overlaying conditional divs, server-side search/pagination), and it allowed me to explore and grow my expertise I could not have been able to otherwise. Now, if I ever face these challenges again, Ill know what to reference back to whenever I need help.
What did not work
For the most part, I think independent work was a huge plus. However, there were times when I felt that a little more structure might go a long way. For example, one issue I faced, which was much more my own fault, was the fact that a flexible schedule and later work hours meant I would often find myself working until our standup, without taking a break to eat with my family for dinner. I did feel a bit burnt out at nights when this happened, as I would finish working at around 10 pm, and maybe a little more scheduled structure mightve helped me derive a better work-life balance (though, again, this is also my responsibility in the first place).
Another component that mightve worked better was also related to independence. Though there were many tasks I would have been able to ask for help with, there were a few where it was difficult to reach out for help with. Since they were very niche/specific to certain package behaviors, it was hard to get help from anyone outside of StackOverflow or the package maintainers. I felt this with a particular issue when I worked on integrating DraftJS to develop a rich text editor (inline styling for bold italics, etc.), and definitely felt at times that another pair of eyes and expertise might have helped me get a better handle on how to scope the best packages to use and the best ways to use them. However, it all ended well in the end, and Im happy to finally see it fully-functional and working in the codebase.
Conclusion
This internship experience was definitely a little bit more unorthodox than I think most mightve been. Last summer, I had worked at Zenefits, a much bigger startup, and though they also embraced me into the team, I think I really felt much more connected with the rest of the front-end team at Glific. Not once did I feel like an intern vs. the rest of the team, and not once did I feel like I couldnt contribute just as much or wasnt asked as much of as the rest of the team. I think this lack of orthodox structure let me really understand what its like to work as a full-time, remote front-end engineer, and gave me a better understanding of what the different use-cases and benefits Glific can provide towards these NGOs with a variety of different communication scaling issues. Im proud to have worked and learned alongside a light-hearted team always ready to crack jokes at standups, and I cant wait to see what else lies in store for the rest of the team and the platform.Title: Glific Thanksgiving Report

==================================================

It seems like forever, but it has just been a bit more than 5 months since we made the
first commit to Glific
. But what an amazing time it has been. From thinking of the product five months ago to having a great group of 10 NGO paying customers by the end of this month, it has truly been a great way to spend all the extra time we had during the pandemic!
Since we just wrapped up Thanksgiving and are heading into the holiday season, it is a good time to acknowledge and thank the various groups that make things like Glific a reality
The core Glific team composing of Abhishek Sharma, Anshul Gupta, Vaibhav Rathore, Pankaj Agrawal, Dignesh Gujarathi, and Kurund Jalmi.
The larger open source ecosystem that is making the product a reality. In specific thanks to the team behind
Elixir
,
Ecto
,
Phoenix
,
Absinthe
,
Oban
,
PoW
,
React
,
Apollo
, and
AppSignal
.
Our NGO Pilot Program participants, specifically
Slam Out Loud
and
India Literacy project
and our WhatsApp Business Service Provider,
Gupshup
. All of them answered all our queries and persistent questioning with so much grace and patience.
And finally, the Tech4Dev Funders, a group of old and new friends, who have put their faith, trust, and money behind everything we do. Thank you for making this possible
Kurund, Michael (his new boss) and the CiviCRM doc team
To be honest there were two events that happened this week that triggered this post. My good friend and colleague, Kurund Jalmi, moved to the UK today and hence moved on from Glific and Tech4Dev. We’ll convince him and twist his arm to give us a fair bit of time over the next few months as we try to fill in his super big shoes. I’ve known and worked closely with Kurund for 15+ years, and I’m both sad that he has left, but super happy for him to try new things in a new country. The above is a photo of Kurund (in his younger days) on his first US trip for the
CiviCRM
documentation sprint @ Lake Tahoe
We also managed to hit our first major operational snafu this week, which kept Pankaj and I awake for the past 3 nights. This was expected, and we will have a few more of them over the next couple of months and years. The more important point is it gets the team to learn how to analyze and debug operational issues in a calm and composed manner, putting in the extra hours as needed, but always approaching it from a logical and reasoned position. For the techies amongst you, as with everything, it was a combination of multiple things including bad database queries, too many API requests coming from the frontend, and some magic that we are still understanding in the underlying framework.
This started off as a 5 month retrospective, but midway thru the post took a detour and we ended up with a thanksgiving thank you. I’ll be back with our 6 month retrospective by the end of this month

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/glific-update-a-7-week-retrospective/
==================================================

Hard to believe, but it has been 7 weeks since we kick-started the
Glific
project. The past 7 weeks have been amazing, a lot of intense work, way too many meetings, and lots of learning all around. For me, personally, it has been a great experience to dive in and build another open source project from scratch, but at a very different pace, and more importantly, with a strong focus on the developing world.
I’m struck by how much the technology and open source world has changed in the past decade. The number of tools and platforms that we are building on to make Glific a reality did not exist a decade or more ago when we started
CiviCRM
. The speed at which we are moving and developing features and infrastructure is super impressive. Coming in, I assumed it would take us 3 months to get a better idea of what we wanted to do and how we’d approach it. And here we are, in week 7 and we have a pretty awesome work-in-progress which handles a lot of things which were in our dreams and potential post 1.0 candidates. Overall, we are super pleased and stoked at our velocity and we will continue pushing hard and fast.
A couple of screenshots to display where we are today:
A couple of highlights and salient features of our process. I’ve incorporated both technical and non-technical aspects in the below list, since I do think that a synthesis of the two is essential to create great products.
The backend and frontend teams are marching at their own pace, with limited communication. However, the API allows the frontend to interface with all the cool stuff the backend is building, without significant in-person communication. This is super-important since this is the same API that we will expose to out NGOs (actually their software partners). So for the backend group, the frontend team is a client, just like any other third-party client.
UTF-8, multi-lingual, switching languages on the fly are super essential and core to what we are building. We recognize and realize the importance of this especially in the context of a country like India, where this is so important.
Talking to multiple NGOs on a weekly basis really influences what we are building and why. Being able to switch languages and send messages to a user based on their chosen language came from our conversations with
Slam Out Loud
. The ability to create user profiles and personas came from multiple conversations with organizations like IDInsight, Digital Green, Leap For Word, Dost Education, and others.
Emphasizing process early on in the lifecycle (yes, 20 years ago, I would scoff at this very idea) has really helped us. Shooting for a goal of 90%+ test coverage, good documentation generated early, and often, re-writing the same code base 3 times in different ways in the span of 2 weeks (yes, this did happen!) is frustrating, but at the same time helps us create a better product. Something that we are proud of 🙂
I’ve specifically stayed away from describing some of the v0.1 features (since Abhishek will be talking about it in a future blog post), but we do have conversations, automatic tagging, global keyword automation, menu-driven automation and more working in a prototype version with a fairly solid architecture behind it (along with great test coverage)
To all our NGO partners out there, who have been so gracious with their time and inputs, thank you :). We’ll be showcasing v0.1 to our NGO advisory group and the tech4dev partner group in the second week of July.
We are stoked and proud of what we have build in v0.1, we will definitely raise the bar and aim higher for v0.2 and go live with at least one NGO!

Date: September 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/glific-v0-3-takes-off/
==================================================

A new month, a new glific release.  Really like the pace and duration of these sprints, makes the entire team accountable and focussed towards a specific goal with everyone pulling in unison towards it. I’ll let the video do most of the talking and highlight a few things and next steps for the team
We’ve accomplished a lot in the short span of 3 months and as a team, we are incredibly proud and thrilled to see how far we’ve come at this time. A couple of highlights and other tidbits:
We have a new logo for the product. Kudos to Sunna, Abhishek, and the team at
Colored Cow
. Our website will be up later this month.
We’ve onboarded two NGOs in the pilot program and getting a fair bit of feedback and insights from them into how to make the product work in the real world and in their day-to-day operations.
Focus on automated testing, comprehensive documentation, and API first build philosophy.
Functionality to manage tens of staff and thousands of beneficiaries via groups, collections, and flows.
Ability to customize flows and track usage of how beneficiaries are interacting with the flows.
Improved Search and Tag Management.
Support for sending and receiving rich media messages (video, documents, audio)
With that in mind, we are switching gears a bit for v0.4, and rather than a big release, we will focus on all the small things that will make the platform a lot easier to use and deploy. We will focus on testing for scale and make it easy to add both new organizations and new languages. This also gives us a chance to take a step back., look at the bigger picture, polish off a few things we’ve recently added and improve the codebase. So instead of one large release, we’ll come out with improvements on a weekly basis. We are tracking this in our
GitHub project list
In addition to the above, our goal will be to onboard 3 new NGOs in September. If you are interested, please read the
Glific FAQs
and if your NGO is. good fit, get in touch with us via
email.
We’ll also have our monthly webinar to give you a broad overview of what we’ve accomplished so far, showcase an NGO or two using two-way communication effectively, and answer your questions. The webinar is scheduled for:
Wednesday, Sept 23 @ 10:00 am IST.

==================================================

We continue rolling out new versions of Glific loaded with new and improved features twice a month. At some point in time, we will slow down our release cycle, but at the current moment, release early, release often seems to be holding us in good stead. Documenting all the new features and improvement that are part of the 1.3 release.
Easy identification for flows in drafts
. If you make some unsaved changes to the flows or have some flows as a work-in-progress, you will see it in the flows list screen. The last time you published the flow and the last time you made any changes to the flow are displayed.
Important alerts and notifications on the platform
. You can access the notifications page from the flows screen. It serves as a centralized place to see any critical errors or warnings that happened in the background, like when sending a message failed, any errors in the flow due to unexpected input, errors from BigQuery and/or Google Cloud. This will serve as the system status page for your organization going forward.
Organization phone number in settings
. If you often find yourself scrambling to find your org phone number to send to beneficiaries or whenever you need it, you can now find it under Organisation Settings.
Access more options for collection from the chat screen
. Some time back we made collections accessible from the chat screen in the right sidebar. Now when you select a collection, you can perform more actions: Like adding contacts to the collection or viewing all the details of the collection.
Added support for media in templates
. You can attach images, videos, documents to all HSM templates now. We’re in talks with gupshup for audio with Template messages.
Enhanced performance for higher messaging volumes
. We worked with a couple of organizations:
Weunlearn
and
The Apprentice Project
to ensure the system can scale to meet their needs. We hit a few bumps in the road, but we now have a stable system as a result.
BigQuery, next-generation
. We continue to iterate on our BigQuery (BQ) Integration to make it reliable, and we’ve released another attempt at this. This has been one of the harder integrations, primarily because BQ is different from a regular database, and we are trying to merge the two in a seamless manner, to make it easier for reporting and analytics.
DataStudio Reports.
Organizations can now see stats based on an hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Stats include the number of active contacts, messages exchanged, flows started, and active users. This should give an organization a pretty good idea of their monthly bill.
A few changes coming down the road in 1.4
The pricing model
. The base price includes up to 10 staff users and 250K messages. There is a charge for additional users and additional messages. This is primarily to offset the price we need to pay for additional capacity on our servers to handle the increased load. The pricing buckets are mentioned
here
under the SaaS platform section.
Payment method
. Starting in mid-April, current NGOs will be required to use a credit card to pay for the setup and monthly charges. This will streamline our invoice generation and collection process. We will be using Stripe as our payment processor, and will not be storing any credit card details on our servers.
Localization: A new NGO has requested to have the interface available in Hindi. This gives us the required nudge to translate our interface to Hindi, and hence build in the ability to support the interface in any language. We will manage all our translations on

Date: April 2021

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/glific-v1-4-april-updates/
==================================================

For the second release of this month we are introducing new payment methods, interface language support, account creation, performance, and security along with other minor issues that our NGO partners have raised. Here they are in detail:
Payment method
:
In our effort to automate billing, Stripe integration is in progress and NGOs need to pay their monthly subscription for the SaaS offering via credit cards soon, rather than processing invoices manually.
Check for message size
: Messages beyond 4096 characters cannot be sent. To make sure you dont meet any unexpected errors, weve placed character limits on the interface when setting up the flows or sending custom message.
Language options for interface
: Few NGOs wanted to use the platform in local languages such as Hindi. Hence, staff members will be able to set the interface language to Hindi and English now as per their comfort. More languages can be introduced later too.
Folders by contact names in GCS
: It is now possible tosegregate media files into folders created by contact names. This is a custom feature, that needs to be requested specifically by the NGO to the product team, and not enabled for everyone.
Ease in account creation
: Earlier, the Glific team gave admin access to the first staff member as a part of the onboarding process. Now the first admin account will be approved automatically without Glific teams intervention making the process a lot faster, and smoother.
HSM template preview
: While creating or editing an HSM template, you can preview the template message in a mobile simulator. This helps you view your message formatting & avoid errors.
Enhanced system security
: More secure API endpoints for authorised access.
Enhanced performance
: You should witness faster loading of the platform with the most recent updates.
Image aspect ratio
: There was slight issue with images not showing in the right aspect ratio on the Glific platform. That has been fixed.
Minor scroll enhancement
: When staff sends a custom message, the chat window will scroll to the latest message to stay within the context of the conversation.
Support for variables in parent and child flows
: A parent flow can get the value of a variable set in a child flow and a child can get the value of variables from the parent flow.

==================================================

Application localization is the process of adapting an existing application to the target market’s native language and culture. It refers to the process of translating an application into a different language and culture.
We are pleased to announce that the
Glific
interface is now available in Hindi beginning with v1.4. Users simply need to go to My Account and change the Change Interface Language setting. Since the majority of the NGOs are from different parts of India, this Hindi language interface might be useful to them; however, we would like to add other languages to provide more support.
When it comes to React localization, there are also plenty of internationalization (i18n) libraries to choose from.
18next
is one of the most common, and for good reason: the library is stable, feature-rich, and frequently updated.
i18next
is also learn once, translate everywhere, as it works for a variety of front-end and back-end frameworks.
I’d like to express my gratitude to
lokalise
for providing us with a complimentary license.
Lokalise
is a localization and translation management tool that allows you to integrate with your code repository so that any changes you make to the code are automatically imported into Lokalise for translation. After it has been imported, we should add the translations for all of the keywords that have been added. The

Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

We as a team are into the second month of project Glific (also popularly known as Two Way Communications) & it has been very eventful. The initial month was all about learning, listening to NGOs & exploring different technologies to use for the project in the long run whereas now I would say we are in a phase of working our plan. Among a lot of things we are learning every day & using GraphQL is one thing which I liked the most & I will be elaborating more on it here.
For those coming from REST background, stick towards the end of the blog to know how GraphQL might make it even better a choice for your applications.
What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs. In web application context, it’s all mostly getting data from the server & showing it client side. GraphQL makes this process much more efficient & light.
Why should one choose GraphQL?
Removes limitations that REST has – When we start thinking about REST APIs one can imagine creating as many API endpoints as the application UI expects. In case the UI changes, the API might not be completely relevant & would need an immediate change to it.
Fetch what you need – GraphQL is powerful in terms of fetching what is needed thereby increasing performance of the application
It makes it easy for both frontend and backend team to work independently
We can update APIs without following versioning, quicker adaptability.
Core Concepts
GraphQL has three main building blocks:
Schema
,
Queries
,
Resolvers
.
Schema
A GraphQL schema is at the core of any GraphQL server implementation. It describes the functionality available to the client applications that connect to it. GraphQL can be used with any backend framework or programming language. We are using
Absinthe
(GraphQL implementation for Elixir) In schema, we define the query & mutator structure for the type.
Queries
Compared to REST, when working with GraphQL there is only one endpoint exposed & the structure of the data returned is not defined. Query in GraphQL is the information that the client needs to specify on what structure of data is expected in return.
In the above example, the query is the operation type, GetMessageByID is the operation name & $id is variable definition saying, what is expected.
Resolvers
A resolver tells GraphQL how and where to fetch the data corresponding to a given field. Resolvers can be used for mutation (altering/ creating records) in the database. Another important concept in resolver is ‘context’ which is the one which provides access to the database.
One can write logic inside the resolver to make the most of it.
How we are using GraphQL in Glific Project
At the backend, we use
Absinthe
to implement GraphQL .
At the frontend,
Apollo Client
writes GraphQL queries.
My Experience in learning & using GraphQL
Coming from a background of using REST APIs extensively in building robust web applications, I was curious to learn how GraphQL can make an impact. At the start, it felt like, why are we writing a lot to achieve the response we need, but the more & more I am reading & implementing it I see the advantages it brings in.  I have been a great fan of it.
The fact of exposing one API endpoint & leaving the flexibility of the structure of data expectation at the hand of developers who use it makes it so better of choice.Title: Glific

==================================================

About Glific
Glific
is an open-source two-way-communication platform. It is a simple to use tool, with a complex setup of Whatsapp business API, Gupshup, Google cloud storage, BigQuery, etc running behind the scene.
Tides
is the SAAS platform for Glific, hosted by ColoredCow, which NGOs subscribe to and use for their needs.
We launched v1.0 a few days ago. The team is excited more than ever and now building new features and functionality every day. Every day there are intense conversations around features that should go first which helps NGOs connect with their beneficiaries efficiently and in an easy manner.
Glific welcomed by the NGO community
Glific is received well by the NGO community. We are onboarding new NGOs on a regular basis. Currently, Glific has 17 NGOs who are using the platform to connect with their beneficiaries and making an impact.
Growing NGOs and their queries
As the number of NGOs is growing, the number of their queries, issues, and new requirements is also increasing. At first, the product team and the technical team helped NGOs with their onboarding queries and issues. As these queries are coming from Glific NGO users, it is very important for us to respond to them in time. This is a growing challenge as the same team is working on developing new features as well as supporting them. They needed to concentrate on their respective areas to fasten the development process.
The need for a dedicated support team
It is evident that a dedicated support team is needed to help the customers with their day-to-day issues and free up the product team and the development team from this responsibility. The support teams role is very crucial. It has to work as a bridge between NGOs and the product team. They needed to empathize with the NGOs, understand their issues, resolve them. Hear out their suggestions and convey them efficiently to the product team for further evaluation of their value to the larger NGO community.
I joined the team during the last week of December 2020. The purpose was clear, to establish the support process. Share the burden of the product and development team, so that they could concentrate on their respective work. And gradually phase them out from the daily support needs. The prime challenge here was that this transition of support to a new team shouldnt impact NGOs and their functioning.
Formation of the support team
In order to transition the support quickly and seamlessly, it is decided that the support team gets involved in the day-to-day activity from day one. Learning the support needs on the go, observing how the product team is resolving the issues.
Learning and observing
The initial target was to just listen to what NGOs were saying, understand their requirements and provide support from the documents available. If something goes beyond that, involve the technical team right away and resolve the query then and there. We are using the
discord
channel to answer NGOs questions and it is helping us to collaborate and respond to queries real quickly.
We started learning more from the support calls. To learn even more about the issues NGOs were facing we started doing collective
sessions
with them. We answered their queries about the features and took notes of the challenges they were facing.
As our knowledge grew, we started documenting it. The approach is to document every query NGOs are asking us. Thereby creating a true support knowledge base.
Streamlining the support process
We started managing these support articles in Google Drive and started sharing them with the NGOs. But as the number grew, this model isnt working as efficiently for a larger audience.
During one of our daily standups, we discussed this challenge among the group. Lobo suggested evaluating
Slab
, a tool for efficiently managing these articles. We found this tool useful and started migrating the support articles. It helped to keep all the documents in one place. It is easy to review and publish the articles and share them with the NGOs.
Any time a new kind of query or issue is asked, we create or update the articles. I was learning on the go while resolving issues and creating these support documents. After completing my knowledge about the product, I reached the state where I started handling supports independently.
The next step is to understand the system better. I started exploring the system, myself, wherever I needed help I looped the product team in. This helped me to understand the system better and I started creating documents about the product features, which I learned during my exploration of the system.
Easy accessibility of help documentation
Slab is working fine for the documentation but the way we were sharing them with NGOs, it is getting tough for them to remember the relevant documents URL. With the increasing number of documents, it is becoming even more difficult. They were either saving the URLs somewhere or adding them as bookmarks on their browsers.
The team then came up with an idea to place these documents
http://docs.glific.org/
on the Glific dashboard itself. This made the documents easily accessible for the NGOs which they could use whenever they needed to.
Gradually, I have reached a point where I am keeping pace with the launch of a new feature and its support document. NGOs can now get immediate help on any new feature.
Support impact to the product
From time to time, NGOs have suggestions about use cases that can ease their process of connecting with their beneficiaries. We have started capturing them in a form of requirements. These requirements are now added to the list of future feature candidates. Which upon passing the evaluation during our internal team meeting gets added to the
product roadmap
.
Further, we plan to have regular meetings and training sessions with all Glific NGOs to get their suggestions and requirements, which can make Glific more useful for the NGO community.Title: Goa Jan Sprint – Recap and Reflections
Author: Donald Lobo
Date: January 2023

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/goa-jan-sprint-recap/
==================================================

Have been in Goa for 8 days now, first for the BMW Responsible Leaders Conference in North Goa, and then for the Tech4Dev sprint  in South Goa. I’m hoping that other folks from the OpenBrackets,
Development Data Platform
and
Glific
teams will soon post their version of the sprint events. The
Avni Project
has already published a
fabulous set of blogs
. Start with with
Maha’s amazing recap.
Hosting an event in Goa is not cheap, but then I’m always reminded of the conversation that I had with Markus @ BMW Foundation at their last Global gathering in Merida: If we can afford to be generous to our NGO and ecosystem partners, we should. Many of the participants from our ecosystem had not been to Goa, so it was indeed a treat to interact with them in a beautiful place, where we could walk on the beach for hours and hours.
Seems like I’ve made it a habit to fall sick just before/during the sprint, and I lived up to it. Managed to lose my voice on Day 3, so I was mostly a silent participant, and could not be involved with most conversations, which are the best part of the event. In addition to the 20+ NGOs that we had across the course of the event, we also had 3 foundations (4 people) visit us over the course of the week. Overall it is super exciting to see funders interested to learn more about our work and approach. Here are some of my key takeaways
Our approach has always been to get foundation folks to talk to as many people from the ecosystem across all levels of experience. I think it is important and good exposure for everyone involved..  So we had the Fractional CxO’s, Glific Team, DDP Team, Avni/Glific NGOs and ecosystem partners interact with the funders.
In general, I do not sit in those conversations, since we want to allow a free exchange of information. We do tell folks to be honest and transparent. We also introduce them to NGOs or partners who’ve not had a great experience (yes, I know, we do mess up also!) This is basically in line with our transparent and open policies.
It’s also so cool to see the breadth and depth of the conversations that the funders had with folks across the ecosystem. I’m super glad that all of them came and interacted with the folks here, and spent more than 10+ hours across a couple of days.  Gives us confidence that we must be doing something right.
Our current opinion is that most foundations and NGOs without experienced tech and/or open source folks should avoid making significant technology decisions. I’ve spoken to five groups recently (3 NGOs, 2 foundations) that did not realize and understand that the
Platform Commons License
is NOT an open source license. Do not want to get into a flame-war here, but we prefer
OSI approved licenses
for everything.
We like to emphasize that technology by itself is not the solution. Our approach is to talk to multiple NGOs. In the process, we discover the major problems that NGOs encounter and ensure it is applicable across the ecosystem. This ensures we build and own the solution with the ecosystem. We start all our projects with discovery, user interviews, product design before we even think about what technology to use.
Our board member, Arun Kadekodi remarked as he was leaving:
It’s so cool to see the ecosystem grow over time.
Its super cool to see different parts of the ecosystem bloom independently: Avni with Arjun and Vinay, Data Platform with Vinod, Siddanth and Sanjeev, Fractional CxO’s as their own independent tribe (they kicked me out of their meeting!), Glific with Sneha, Vivek, Abhishek(s), Mohit and Erica juggling them all. That without a doubt is the highlight for me at this sprint.
Deep gratitude to all our existing funders, who’ve given us such broad leverage and powers to do what we think is the best thing. Giving us that freedom is very empowering and enables us to aim high.Title: Goa Sprint and DCP Adventure:            Embracing the Unknown

==================================================

The first cohort of
DCP
has come to an end. These three months have been packed with new stuff learning, experiences, meeting new folks, and dealing with fresh challenges. It’s my first time in such a program, and it’s been really good and useful for me.
This is a big deal for me being part of a program for the first time. Everything was so new and everything felt refreshingly novel, at first the things were scary for me like the big terms data, management and all but everything was so good I worked alongside Abhishek Nair in the program. He was truly inspiring and taught me a lot. He helped me remember that this is my time to learn, and he made sure I got the most out of it. It was great working with him.
We were assigned to an NGO called
Uninhibited
. They focus on making young girls aware of menstruation. Their goal is to help adolescent girls track their periods and understand their bodies better. This way, they can get the right healthcare when they need it. Making sure there are safe places for girls during their periods is super important.
Uninhibited has different programs like Hello sathi and Period Shala. We mostly worked on Period Shala. It’s about making schools safe and cool for girls. The goal is:
Changing how people think
: Giving girls important life skills, making them feel confident, and getting teachers involved. It’s not just about physical health but also emotions and societal thinking.
Changing the facilities
: Making sure girls have what they need during their periods, like the right products and good bathrooms. They use data to talk to local authorities about it.
Our role involved streamlining and consolidating data, addressing, top goals were finding a balance between processes and tech utilization. We also figured out how to use tech in a way that really helps the organization. When we shared data with other groups, we thought about what things we couldn’t compromise on. We also talked about using data to understand what’s happening and making sure everyone in the organization gets how important data is.
Uninhibited Works with ‘Period Fellows’ on the ground to help implement their program on the ground and track student progress through the questions like,
“Do they know about periods?
How do they feel about it?”
We helped them pick out the most important things to look at, and suggested them to narrow down their indicators . Working with Bhuvana and Sakshi from the Uninhibited team was really nice.
They had been planning to adopt
Avni
for a long time and then they adopted it during the program. It’s a data collection tool that works both online and offline. It seemed like the best fit for Uninhibited.
We wrapped up the program in Goa. It was awesome meeting everyone face-to-face. We kicked off with some fun activities to get everyone talking.
We also did a chai pe charcha session where we invited the Goa ngo to get to know about our products and ask questions if they have any and get more clarity of our platforms in person.
The entire Goa experience has been great. We went on morning walks and played team activities together, learning new and different meanings of teamwork. We discovered how we can tackle any small or big problem as a team. Sitting with people during lunch and listening to their life experiences was enlightening. I remember a conversation I had with Jacob during lunch. He shared what he likes about India, what he misses about the US, and how his washing machine is giving him a hard time. Conversations like these allow you to understand different perspectives and various ways to deal with problems. Everyone has their own.
Many takeaways, from framing questions to broadening my spectrum, made this journey a valuable experience.
In a nutshell, this DCP journey was like a mix of learning and fun, and a chance to dive into the unknown Looking forward to what comes next!Title: Goa Sprint: Day 1 (Product reviews and awards)

The Tech4dev sprint’s day 1 kicked off with the
Opening Circle
at 9 am, where everyone shared quick intros.
Following that, we dove into a
quarterly product review
featuring presentations from Glific, Dalgo, and Fractional CxO. The presentations covered key highlights, and we also discussed the lowlights, providing a comprehensive overview of each organization’s achievements and their focus for the next quarter. The session was interactive, with people asking questions. As someone who is new to the team, the session was highly informative, providing valuable insights into the projects and deepening my understanding.
The next session, organized by Radhika for the Glific Team, turned out to be quite fun. The team was divided into three groups, and each member wrote down personal or team wins and losses on sticky notes. Afterward, the teams combined their common wins and losses, placing them on the three boards up front.
Later we had a discussion, which started with wins, and some notable ones included improved team coordination, team growth, and the successful launch of new features like the ticketing system and the AI Discord bot. A win that everyone had in common was for better coordination between the product and development teams, thanks to Radhika. After that, everyone walked around, reviewed the notes, and added their initials to the ones they agreed with.
Following this, each team picked two losses and discussed appropriate solutions, which were further explored later on. Teams delved into issues like enhancing invoicing systems, improving feature documentation, and refining social media content.
The last event of the day was “techie for dev,” a fun award ceremony hosted by Krishna Priya and Shamoon and hosted by Tejas, Sangeeta, Shamoon and Krishna Priya. Some amusing tags were given to team members, such as “coffee connoisseur” won by Vinod, “sorry not sorry” won by Lobo, and “happydent smile” won by Erica.Title: Goa sprint: Day 0 (Arrival, Sangath, Dinner)

==================================================

It was a hot day in Goa and on my way to the location from the airport I could see those yellow, blue and red houses that are typical to goan streets. Our hotel was in the proximity of the beach somewhere in North Goa. As soon as I reached there, I could smell the fresh warm breeze that reminded me of the beach and the sand. First person who I met there was Siddhant who arrived early in the morning. We had lunch together and talked about the Dalgo clients we onboarded the previous 2 weeks.
After lunch, I tagged along with Erica, Rahul (from
JSS
who arranged the visit) and 2 folks from Avni (Himesh and ) to visit a Goa-based NGO called
Sangath
. Sangath works in the area of mental health across Pan India. They have main offices (which they call as hubs) in Goa, Bhopal and Delhi . The Goa hub was a very beautiful cozy house turned office. The ground floor had their finance, admin and hr offices, while the first floor had different research departments, place for interns/grad students to sit & work and a quite spacious training room. The entire space had a very calm and welcoming aura. I wouldnt mind sitting there the entire day and doing some coding.
Sangath founded in 1996 by 4 couples who were associated with a university as professors. It started out as a clinical organization that provided counseling services in the area of mental health but now is working in various areas relating directly/indirectly to mental health. Most of their funding and projects are research based in the areas of Health & Equity, Adult, Child development and Adolescent & Youth with Mental Health being at the crux. Mentors (project leads) at Sangath are highly accomplished individuals in the field of mental health graduated from reputed universities like Harvard. These experts also help in training government officials to scale their impact.
Currently, most of the finance and admin related data is handled either by pen paper or excel. They have recently started using a free software called
REDCap
for data collection. They generally adopt software that is HIPAA compliant and REDCap was one of them. They have a small (4-5) dedicated data team that manages all reports, data needs for research and in adoption of softwares like REDCap. IT (maybe 2-3) team takes care of all their servers.
Some of challenges that they face are
Funding is very ad hoc so they cant continue working with communities for a longer period of time. Continuous source of funds is still a challenge.
Data security has been a concern with people coming to the clinic for sessions/counseling. Although Sangath has adhered to data security norms and takes it very seriously, it is difficult for their beneficiaries to understand this.
Most of the team had arrived by evening and we had dinner together. We had an informal kick off planned, which we decided to postpone to the next day since all of our team had not arrived.Title: Goa sprint: Day 2 (Sunday funday)

==================================================

The second day of our Glific Sprint in Goa kicked off with an unexpected twis me waking up at 6 am. This surprising turn of events was the result of a lively discussion at the dinner table the previous night, where bets were placed on who would be the early riser. I wanted to see who would win the bet and I embraced the decision to wake up early and was rewarded with a breathtaking sunrise during our 45-minute walk to Baga beach.
The morning continued with a sense of excitement as we headed back to the hotel, aiming to be on time for a team-building exercise organized by Dasra at 9 am. To add a dash of thrill, being late incurred a fine of Rs. 125 per minute, keeping everyone on their toes.
The team-building exercise proved to be both entertaining and insightful. The exercises were designed to impart experiential learning through a series of engaging games that, at first glance, might seem childish but held deeper meanings.
Game 1: Attack-Rabbit-Wall
This game, a twist on rock-paper-scissors, required teams to make strategic choices to accumulate points. The objective was to encourage group consensus, strategic planning, and adaptability. Although our team didn’t emerge victorious, the experience was both enjoyable and enlightening.
Game 2: Caterpillar
In a nostalgic nod to childhood memories of picking teams for sports, two volunteers became captains and selected their teams. The objective was to form a human caterpillar using pipes and navigate a short distance without using hands. The challenges we faced, such as the pipes sticking to shirts and discomfort, prompted us to strategize and collaborate more efficiently. Despite being late to implement our strategy, the game concluded with a collective sense of achievement.
Game 3: Rollercoaster
With the task of moving a ball to a distant cup using half-cut pipes, the Rollercoaster game challenged our teamwork and adherence to rules. While we scored well, some instances of rule-bending were acknowledged, highlighting the importance of integrity in a team.
Game 4: Island Scenario
This scenario-based game divided the team into three groups, each facing unique challenges on their “island.” The objective was to reach a safe island while overcoming limitations like blindness, leglessness, or speechlessness. The unexpected twists and turns, including a betrayal that wasn’t part of the game, added a layer of fun and unpredictability to the experience.

The day concluded with a reflective session, where the consensus was that the team-building exercises were a success, fostering camaraderie and effective communication.
In the evening, we embarked on a group outing to multiple beaches. A bus journey filled with antakshari set the tone for a delightful evening. From Vagator beach’s beauty to the lively atmosphere of Anjuna beach, the day ended with dancing, swimming, good food, and a mesmerizing sunset.
Overall, Day 2 not only strengthened our team bonds but also provided valuable insights into effective collaboration and communication. The combination of team-building exercises and a group outing proved to be a well-rounded approach to fostering a positive team spirit.Title: Goa sprint: Day 3 (Organization principles and Chai pe charcha)

The day 3 in our Glific Sprint Goa commenced with a session led by Uhanjali and Dinella, during which we exchanged feedback on the enjoyable Sunday activity facilitated by Outdoor Mantra. Subsequently, we delved into a discussion on the 7 principles of Tech4Dev.
7 principles of Tech4Dev
Collaborate over Compete
– We are growing, Lots of work and experiments
Equality
– Treat everyone the same. An NGO should be treated the same as a funder.
Failure?
– Totally ok, Weve FAILED multiple times. Understand what happened
Truth
– Always be honest and upfront with everyone. Set expectations with NGOs/Supervisors ahead of time..
Responsibility
– Mid – Senior level team. Take ownership, drive things forward
Responsiveness
– Please be super responsive (< 24 hours, 1 business day)
Constructive criticism
– All of us can improve, we need our peers to let us know, nicely!
We formed seven groups, each with four members seated at a table.
Each table was assigned a principle, and our task was to discuss how we could relate that principle to our daily work life.
It was an opportunity for us to share thoughts and insights to better understand the principles in the context of our day-to-day professional experiences.
Additionally, Uhanjali and Dinella provided information on our company policies, covering aspects such as the leave structure and reimbursement cycle, ensuring everyone had a clear understanding of these policies, fostering transparency and clarity within the team.
SPRINT SALES ACTIVITY:
We began by arranging the hall for the “Chai Pe Charcha” sales activity. Different teams, including
Glific
on the left, Fcxo and Avni on the right, and Dalgo at the back, occupied different corners. Help desks were set up, where members of the Tec4Dev team assisted NGOs with their queries. There was also open space for thoughtful discussions.
At 2 PM, NGOs started arriving, and the event gained momentum. Local NGOs from Goa were excited to learn about the products, showing active engagement throughout the event. Since it was named “Chai Pe Charcha,” we served tea and snacks to encourage informal conversations. The event provided a great opportunity for collaboration.
Before leaving, NGOs were invited to share feedback about the event and products. It turned out to be a fantastic gathering, bringing everyone together for meaningful discussions and collaboration.Title: Goa: My First Sprint

I almost didnt make it to this sprint, but more on that later. I did make it to Goa and Goa didnt disappoint. The sprint location was wonderful, the weather was gorgeous and beach shacks were close by for local food and drinks. The cool, crisp mornings and stunning sunsets book-ended the day nicely.

We arrived on Sunday afternoon and went straight to the Avni presentations; this was the first day of the Avni sprint and NGOs were presenting their use-cases. It was the first time that the Avni team and their NGOs were meeting face-to-face and each had a lot to learn from the other. The NGOs provided candid feedback about the product and the team was open about their shortcomings and improvement plans. Avni has a good group of customer NGOs and they all like working with the Avni team and appreciate the hard work they put in. I liked the open exchange of thoughts during these presentations; that openness will, no doubt, contribute to a better product and ecstatic users.
My main task at the sprint was to work with the Dev Data Platform (DDP) team to finish some deliverables and to explain DDP to funders and NGOs. DDP is the newest offering from Openbrackets Foundation; it allows NGOs to combine their data from multiple disparate sources into one single unified repository and get analytics and visualizations out of it. Three early adopter NGOs are helping us with the platform requirements to define a well-rounded product offering that directly addresses NGO needs. The Openbrackets team is working on the rollout roadmap and strategy and we plan to roll out the first version of the platform as a SaaS offering soon. With the DDP engineers and our integration partner, we were able to make short work of our deliverables. We also presented DDP to the funders that visited the sprint.
My personal goal for this sprint was to get to know the Openbrackets team whom I had not met in person, and meet and chat with all the NGO representatives. We had some very heartfelt and insightful conversations about work, life and everything in between. Every conversation gave me new learnings and an interesting glimpse into the person and their work. Some of those same learnings will inform how we proceed with the Openbrackets program mentoring women in tech.

So back to why I almost missed this sprint: I was supposed to fly to Pune with enough time to get over jet lag before I went to Goa. My flight got canceled on two consecutive days; first they had mechanical trouble and on the second day they had no crew (you cant make this up!). Finally, on the third day, the stars aligned and they found a crew to fly the plane. I reached Pune 3 days later than I was supposed to with just a day to spare before my Goa flight.
The sprint was a resounding success thanks to the meticulous planning and tireless work by the Openbrackets Sprint Planning team; Im looking forward to attending the next one.Title: Goalkeep @ the Data Catalyst Program

In the social sector it is commonplace to hear of capacity building initiatives for non-profits that are run by well-meaning funders and experts. So we were particularly excited to be invited to plan one that was truly unique and hands-on in its approach. The idea, anchored by Project Tech4Dev in partnership with Dasra, was to bring together leaders and senior management from some of Indias well recognised NGOs for a three-month long cohort-based program focused on building sustainable and scalable data solutions. Several months of planning culminated in bringing together a group of remarkable people to work on enabling NGOs to maximize the potential of data. The program kicked-off last week in the beautiful city of Kochi with 12 non-profits as a part of the Data Catalyst Program (DCP), covering topics from data culture to best practices in data governance to LLMs and AI. We felt much like the
Avengers
as the teams from Goalkeep, Dasra, Tech4Dev & The Agency Fund assembled to conduct the opening action packed two-day workshop.
At Goalkeep, we have been working for the past year to define and explore the concept of building data culture within organizations and the Program acted as the perfect opportunity to share this with the first cohort. Prior to Kochi, we administered the Data Culture Rubric, a self-reflective tool, to 6-12 representatives from each organization, to assess where they stand currently in their data journey as well as their strengths and areas of development (AoDs) across various domains of data culture. (Click here (
https://goalkeep.net/data-culture-quiz/
to explore our lite version).
To have people across different functions and levels within each organization participate in this exercise, engage with their reports, and review their strengths and AoDs added much depth to the discussions and geared us all up for the in-person sessions that were coming up in Kochi in a couple of weeks.
Data Culture Rubric Conversations with Uninhibited
We were super excited to start the Program with a session on How does data fit into your org vision?, where we first conducted a simulation to get participants to explore different strategies that can be utilized to solve data challenges. Participants were divided into teams and were given a case study involving a data-related problem statement. While the competitive spirit was evident, we witnessed some rigorous discussions and debates that really set us up for our next segment: taking learnings from the simulation and applying them to ones own organizational context.
Each NGO defined one data challenge they wished to focus on over the next 3 months. They were also able to identify levers from the simulation to help solve this challenge and break them down into an action plan. To facilitate this process we had staff from Tech4Dev, The Agency Fund and Goalkeep support each organization in articulating their problem statement and plan. It was particularly rewarding to see most participants speaking a common data language: We are doing well in
Data Literacy
, but what can we do better in
Data
Utilization
?, How can we improve
Data Governance
by improving our data privacy practices?
This also acted as a base for the learning that was to come in subsequent sessions on Data Leadership & Data Processes. To conclude the day, NGOs spent time incorporating their learnings from these sessions into their action plans.
Engaging with such diverse organizations, sharing our tools and knowledge with them, receiving feedback and hearing their reflections added great value to our experience.
Some glimpses of How does data culture fit into your org vision?
Two highlights for us as we left Kochi:
The opportunity to collaborate with Dasra, Tech4Dev & The Agency Fund, each of whom bring immense experience and expertise: while there is always room to grow, it was great to see how we were able to come together and take responsibility for different pieces for the data puzzle while trying to ensure we add value to all participants.
It was really inspiring to see the commitment that NGOs brought to the Program. We are certain that being away from their core roles for even two days would not have been easy. However, the intensity with which everyone engaged in each session, took ownership of their learning by sitting individually with various experts, and using lunch and tea breaks as opportunities to get to know other organizations was incredible.
As we move into the next phase of this program, we look forward to supporting each organization as they work towards solving their identified data problems and in turn building a strong data culture!Title: Goalkeep at the Data Catalyst Program: Module 2 Insights

==================================================

Goalkeepers stand ready to champion data culture!
Module 2 of the Data Catalyst Program, unfolding against the serene backdrop of Goa was structured as a two-day workshop featuring engaging sessions by Project Tech4Dev, Dasra and Goalkeep. Our sessions bookended the agenda on both days anchoring the opening session
Catalyst Chronicles
, and the closing, reflective session
Are We There Yet: {{Insert Future}}
‘ that closed Module 2. Another of our priorities was to walk the talk and manage the feedback collection process during the workshop with the aim of ensuring data-driven design for future iterations of the program.
During the three months between modules 1 and 2 of the program, organizations worked on action plans to address specific problem statements they had articulated in their application forms and further refined through discussions with program team representatives assigned to each org. Participants received continuous support from subject matter experts during this period. This structured approach was aimed at (a) driving tangible change within each organization and (b) building new knowledge and skills among individual participants.
The objective of the ‘Catalyst Chronicles’ sessions was to create a space where each participating organization could showcase and actively discuss their data journeys, providing an opportunity not only to gain insights but also to receive positive reinforcement and feedback from their peers.
While most teams made commendable progress, they were not without challenges. Some organizations refined their problem statements for precision, while others grappled with securing buy-in from leadership and other internal stakeholders. Participants also tried to update their solutions to account for the interconnected nature of various data elements, emphasizing how data literacy is foundational to effective data utilization and how the absence of data governance can erode trust in data.
The panel discussions during the presentations (which were organized based on the progress of organizations through the data maturity lifecycle), showcased their challenges and solutions. The first group showed how they were leveraging data for pilots, hypothesis testing, and optimizing user journeys for improved Data Utilization. Trust in Data – the collective responsibility of all members to maintain data quality through robust data governance structures – was the focus of the second group. The third group delved into optimizing Data Consolidation to enhance data access and reduce costs, while the fourth group shared insights on improving Data Collection processes. Taken together, the groups addressed all four domains of data culture (Strategy, Technology, Process, Data)..
Two quick glimpses into the progress made: Uninhibited presented their adoption of Avni as a data collection tool, a substantial stride toward digitizing their data collection process within the three-month period. Saajha showcased their prowess in data transformation, achieving a remarkable reduction in data processing costs by over 50%.
NGOs share their data journeys and answer audience questions
Our commitment to collecting feedback led to the design of a gamified experience for all participants. A brief five-minute window was provided to complete the feedback form, with a live counter displaying total responses received. Participants were granted access to the next section or a much-needed chai-biskoot break upon reaching the target number of responses. Adding a touch of excitement, Manije from the Goalkeep team took on the role of a bouncer, ensuring participants submitted their responses before exiting the room, which helped us achieve a 95%  feedback collection rate!
The concluding session of Module 2 saw participants crafting timelines of the two days on chart paper alongside reflections on their learnings during the closing session. We shared the story of
how ARMMAN leveraged machine learning to better target interventions to the right beneficiaries
to inspire the cohort as well as to underscore the fact that building a data culture is a tedious and gradual process. What we wanted the cohort to know, however, was that they had successfully taken the first (and hardest!) step in that direction during the past three months.
Data Catalysts summarize their takeaways from each session
Our highlights from Module 2 included observing participants actively engaging in dialogue, posing questions, and offering solutions based on their project progress. The seamless flow of sessions on both days, with minimal delays, underscored the meticulous planning that went into shaping these interactions.
As we embark on the next phase of this transformative program, our vision is to empower the cohort to navigate their data journeys independently and continue to build a data-driven culture!
And that’s a wrap for DCP Cohort 23-24!Title: Goalkeep at the Second Cohort of the Data Catalyst Program

==================================================

Goalkeepers stand ready to champion data culture!
After nearly a year, we were thrilled to return as Tech4Dev and Dasra’s knowledge partners for the second cohort of the Data Catalyst Program, comprised of leaders and senior management from 10 organizations, all eager to build sustainable and scalable data solutions over the next six months. Like last year, the program features two in-person workshops complemented by individualized support from mentors with deep data expertise. Goalkeep is serving as mentors for four organizations, in addition to facilitating two sessions at the first workshop.
Our first session, titled “Data Dialogues,” was designed to help organizations get acquainted with the data challenges that other NGOs aimed to solve through the program, and identify opportunities to contribute and source solutions to common data problems. Going into the workshop, each organization had worked with their mentors to articulate a problem statement and 3-month action plan. We collated these into individual charts (see image below) designed using each organization’s brand colors (shoutout to our colleague Bhumika), which added a personal touch that really enhanced the experience.
The charts were put up around the room, and as participants moved about reading them, they were prompted to attach three types of post-its when they:
A. identified similar challenges faced by other NGOs
B. wanted to offer help or connect to someone who could assist
C. found something interesting that they wanted to highlight
It was inspiring to see the cohort engaging with each other, reassured by the fact that other organizations were working on similar challenges and motivated to embark on their data journey together.
The second session, “The Art and Science of Building Effective Dashboards” was inspired by the knowledge that non-profit organizations often gather large amounts of data but struggle to prioritize what to display on a dashboard and how to structure information. The first part of the session introduced the Goalkeep “Key Questions” framework through a real-world case study. The framework helps participants identify and prioritize key questions, guiding them in determining what data should be presented on dashboards. Once participants had a clearer understanding of what data to display, we introduced the five principles of information and visual hierarchy.
Participants worked in pairs to apply these concepts to a mock dashboard we had set up using Google Sheets. While we couldn’t provide as much hands-on practice time as we had hoped, we believe the session gave clarity on how to build impactful and visually engaging dashboards.
The rest of the workshop has several hours of work time dedicated to working with our assigned organizations on their problem statements. Over the next 3 months, we are looking forward to supporting our mentee organizations as they work on their chosen problem statements and returning for the second workshop excited to present progress and learnings as they continue to build strong data-driven organizations.Title: Goalkeep at the Tech4Dev Sprint Jan 2023

==================================================

How do we build data culture within nonprofits, and what does that even mean?
… is a question we have been obsessing over at Goalkeep this past year. Weve figured that one key element of data culture is the ability to put data into the hands of individuals and teams with minimal repetitive effort. But thats easier said than done.
As non-profits grow out of their bootstrap/startup stage, manage to walk the tightrope between impact and scale, get more professional and establish second lines of leadership, and continually iterate on their program design and delivery, we believe that they are bound to ask a common set of questions.
How do we get a holistic view of my program / organization?
How do we consolidate data from multiple data sources?
How do we get accurate measurements of key metrics?
How do we quickly respond to changes in program design?
As organizations evolve, the volume and diversity of data that organizations collect increases significantly and the questions that teams ask of their data become more nuanced. The classic solution to this problem has been to manually collate data from multiple sources in the form of spreadsheets and consolidate them using complicated Excel formulas and pivot tables built on top of pivot tables. However, this is far from sustainable as the entire process needs to be repeated every quarter, if not every month, is prone to human error, and the knowledge of how to do this lies with a small set of individuals.
As we were evaluating different tech solutions to solve this data consolidation issue (see the work-in-progress landscape below), we stumbled upon the same set of open-source tools that the Tech4Dev team was also considering for the
Development Data Platform
(DDP).
A WhatsApp message from Lobo followed by a couple of meetings over coffee led to us (Goalkeep) drafting a proposal to build a proof-ofconcept (PoC) for Dost Education, one of our existing clients, and also an invitation to the Jan Glific/Avni Sprint in Goa.
As part of a past engagement, we had built a system to analyze responses to prompts embedded within Dost Educations IVR-based ECCE program:
M&E Framework configured in Google Sheets
Responses to IVR Prompts available on Google BigQuery
17 tables across both data sources
170 Questions (73 legacy questions that are currently inactive)
2.3 million rows of data (~ 600 MB)
13+ user dimensions
6+ program dimensions
Baseline vs Midline vs Endline comparison needing
300+ lines of data transformation code (written in SQL)
This set up posed several challenges:
it was really difficult to build new data assets as one had to navigate through 300+ lines of code every time a new metric or dimension needed to be added
this also made it very difficult to debug issues with current dashboards
all data aggregation jobs were run on full data (instead of only the data that had been modified since the last run
The objective of our current proof-of-concept was to rebuild the same (IVR Prompt Response Analysis system) using the latest set of open-source data engineering tools:
Airbyte (
airbyte.com
) for connecting to multiple data sources (e.g. google sheets, surveymonkey, Zoho CRM) and loading them into a single data warehouse (e.g. Google Bigquery, Amazon RedShift, Postgres DB)
dbt /  data build tool (
getdbt.com
) to transform data within the data warehouse itself; here transformation = aggregation, joins, unions, pivots, unpivots
Prefect (
prefect.io
) to trigger airbyte and dbt on an hourly schedule and also to send alerts in case of sync failure
A key principle that we tried to follow when designing this proof-of-concept was that we would not solve a new problem (or calculate a new metric), but solve an old problem with a new set of tools, and in the process evaluate whether these tools were better (i.e. faster, more accurate, scalable).
Here is how we configured these different components:
Over the 2 weeks leading up to the Tech4Dev sprint, we had our basic infrastructure in place:
a linux server running on Dosts Google Cloud Platform account
Airbyte installed and pulling data from google sheets and uploading to google BigQuery
A dbt project and associated github repository with all data sources and staging queries documented
We used the time at the sprint to
finish migrating all data transformation code to dbt, and also setting up data integrity tests (e.g. checking if all tables had unique records)
setting up Prefect to run data ingestion and transformation on a hourly schedule
conducting a walkthrough of the Dost project for the DDP team
An indispensable output of this approach is the birds eye view it provides of an entire data pipeline, letting us build, upgrade and validate data transformation code in much smaller manageable chunks:
As I spent time on these tools, I really came to value the ease with which one could debug issues that earlier took several hours to solve, and the confidence that this approach gives us through its automated set of data integrity tests that can be run each time you make changes to the data pipeline. This really sets up Dost Education to even more complex analytics for future projects such as their WhatsApp program (which we have already started building on DDP).
We ended the sprint by preparing a demo for all Glific-user NGOs who were present at the sprint as well as for two prospective funder organizations and received some immediate interest.
We hope that many organizations sign up to evaluate the Development Data Platform, and that it revolutionizes how the now-profit sector uses data in the next 2-3 years.Title: Good Tech Fest 2024 – Sundance Utah

==================================================

Some reflections and thoughts on the
Good Tech Fest Conference
that I attended in Sundance, Utah from Apr 29 – May 2, 2024. I’ve organized and attended a fair number of these conferences to have a good sense of what to expect from the event. Was looking forward to meeting a lot of people from the US non-profit tech ecosystem and expand my horizons and thinking,. Was excited and nervous to talk to new folks, learn what they are doing and talk about the work that we are doing
Overall, the event met and exceeded my expectations. I did not think so initially, but when talking about the various things and conversations about the event with Temina and Radhika, I realized that it was quite a few jam packed days with lots of conversations, discussions, walks and more. The venue and location (Sundance Resort, Utah) was amazing and I loved being in the mountains.
Such a delight to be in the mountains alongside a rushing stream
Just a few random highs and lows a week after I got back. This has given me enough time to absorb and reflect on the week and is a bit beyond the moment
Loved the conversations that I had with multiple folks, in specific (and also a reminder to me to catch up with them soon), conversations with
– Jim Fruchterman from Techmatters, I’ve been a long time fan of his work and he has been an inspiration for a long long time
– Sid Ravinatula from IDInsight – We’ve been on a lot of email threads together, but was great to meet and learn more about Sid and the work they’ve been doing @ IDI. Seems like there are lots of places where we can and should collaborate with IDI
– The team from DrivenData, Peter, Greg and Emily. Hoping to pick their brains as we build a data science and engineering team to work with NGOs in the Global South
– Good last day walk with Jake Porway – co-founder of Datakind. Kinda interesting to see how we’ve all walked on similar yet different paths but landing in the same place
– Very brief conversation with Matt Gee from Brighthive.io. Might be a good connect for the work we are doing with Dalgo
– Learned a lot about Justice, Immigrants and Migration from Ana and Ben of Mobile Pathways. Was quite amazing to see Ben share his visual notes of presentations as they were happening, an example image below:
Loved the open nature and conversations of the opening dinner and the small group discussions of the first day. Would have loved to see a few more in-depth technical talks, since a majority of the discussions were at a fairly high level
Not a big fan of the second day format where we had approx 8 or so lightning talks of 15-20 minutes each. Seemed like some people (including me) had tuned out and were busy with their own work. I think a mixture of talks (maybe shorter) with small discussions might have been my preference. Also would have loved for it to be a bit more tech-heavy
The final day was a mix, with many folks having to leave early. But listening to an artist (Jason) talk about Identity, Art & AI was quite fascinating and interesting. Quite mind-blowing to see how these worlds collide and intersect with each other
The venue and location was great. The food was quite good, but could have used a few more vegetarian options. Coffee was decent, though due to some miscommunication, coffee was missing for breakfast the first day!
Loved to see as to how strong the data culture is within the US ecosystem. There seemed to be a fair representations from data science consulting companies in the room. Lots of things we can learn and borrow from
Would love to see more international representation and from NGOs doing work in the GlobalSouth. Seemed like there were just a few of us there
Loved to hear this event is going international with the next one being planned for Nairobi. Would love to see this happen in Delhi also
Expected to see a few more folks from the funding ecosystem in the room, but this was not the case. Not sure why I was expecting this
Big thanks to Andrew Means and Brittany Biggs for doing such an amazing job organizing and managing this event along with the logistics etc. Was a lot of fun.
Bottom line, it was good for me to re-connect with the US ecosystem and see whats happening, Lots of things we can borrow from here to deploy in India and elsewhereTitle: Google – Tech4Good Summit 2019 – Aug 23 – Apply NOW!

==================================================

We have implemented the Case Management System for HAQ, using an Open Source software platform PRIMERO and the project has been completed and handed over to the HAQ team.
HAQ: Centre for Child Rights works towards the recognition, promotion, and protection of rights of all children. HAQ undertakes not only research and documentation but also is actively engaged in public education and advocacy on children?s rights. It also seeks to serve as a resource and support base for individuals and groups dealing with children at every level.
Here are the key features that were implemented as a part of this project.
User creation
Managing roles for users
Role-specific forms
Case management
Case assignment & referral
Uploaded document handling
Report generation
Audit log

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/haq-project-update-primero-review/
==================================================

This is a follow up to our previous
post
. We have been evaluating Primero for HAQ and here is the progress on the same.
We have been using Child Protection Information Management CPIMS+/Primero for this implementation. The system helps intake relevant information via multiple sources, consolidates the information into relevant record types (Cases / Incidents / Tracing Requests) and allows service providers to report and make educated decisions to assist in these locations.
Demo?s looked very promising and we were able to mockup few functionalities with ease. However, we faced several hurdles during the installation process.
Primero installation was a challenge because the installation guide provided by primero officials is very basic and doesn?t include troubleshooting in case of issues encountered during the installation process.
Primero is developed using Ruby on Rails (RoR) and CouchDB is the database backend. We come from non-ROR development background hence, we had some issues setting up the environment and the required packages.
Once we got Primero up and running on our dev servers it was easy to set up various forms and permissions. We were able to create new roles and also assign role specific forms. This whole form creation and the field level permission structure is quite impressive. However, it is not a drag and drop interface we have to manually fill all the information of fields. So the addition of new form with a lot of fields is a bit time-consuming.
Though primero satisfies most of the requirements of our project, we do need some amount of code customization.
Here are some of the issues that we are facing currently.
Primero lacks the feature of the conditional fields, so we trying to find some workaround for this.
Primero has a date range field, but it does not seem to be working in our system. Each time we add date range field, the form just stops working.
The file upload field is not available. We crashed the application when tried to implement this. We have posted this issue in Primero?s Jira, but have not received any support.
One of our main concern is the lack of community behind this project and the non-responsive support channels.Title: HAQ – Primero issues and the workarounds

==================================================

We are using Primero for implementing case management for HAQ project.  While it meets most of our requirements there were few issues with conditional and file upload fields as mentioned earlier in our previous post. Here is an update on our analysis and the solutions that we went ahead with.
Conditional Fields
For conditional fields instead of making any major changes in Primero?s default functionality, we implemented this logic by adding JavaScript at the form level. For adding JavaScript in Primero we followed basic Ruby On Rails fundamentals. Primero is using vendor/assets/javascripts folder for all its JS files. We have a choice of three locations for the local JS file:
* app/assets/javascripts folder
* lib/assets/javascripts folder
* vendor/assets/javascripts folder
In our case, we added all our JavaScript files in the app/assets/javascripts folder and then invoked the JavaScript in the application.js file.
File upload fields
For file upload fields, project requirement was to add the upload button inside multiple forms. We successfully managed to configure file bundle in Primero to add a document upload field in required forms. However, only one file upload was working when there were multiple upload fields on the same form.  We were unable to find a solution for this.  For now, we are using a separate form for uploading all the document files.
Moving forward with our requirements there were some more challenges. Our next requirement was to provide Read/Write permissions to different roles and creating reports.
The project requirement was to allow view access for case information & workflows to all the users and give write permission only to those forms where the user is the owner of the form. Currently, Primero does not allow creating view only permission at the form level. So basically we cannot have roles with edit permission for few forms and view for other forms.
The workaround for this was to create two identical forms for such cases which are mapped to same DB name and then in one form we disabled the fields in order to make them read-only.
Finally for creating custom reports. As per the specified requirement, HAQ asked us to create 28 reports which consist of basic and complex reports. We were able to create some basic reports but we were facing difficulty for generating complex reports. Primero cannot generate reports from a text field it can only generate reports from fields like dropdown, radio button, date fields, etc which means it generates a report only from those fields whose predefined option values are already stored in DB. We came across one more issue where only two columns or two rows can be used in the group by clause for report generation so we cannot create reports that require multiple rows or columns for grouping. In light of these issues, we are evaluating a third party tool like Metabase/Superset for report generation. Primero uses CouchDB as the database backend and Metabase /Superset does not accept CouchDB as a data source. Hence, we are trying to export CouchDB data to PostgreSQL and then build a report on that.
Any feedback is highly appreciated.Title: HAQ – Tech4Dev update

==================================================

As a part of tech4dev initiative, we are working on a project for
HAQ: Centre for Child Rights
.
About HAQ
?In spirit, HAQ dedicates itself to the recognition, promotion, and protection of the rights of all children. In approach, HAQ focuses on children in a holistic way – as Actors in society, as Citizens of today, and as Adults of tomorrow.
In practice, HAQ strives to propel child rights into all mainstream development efforts, governmental and non-governmental, and place it on the centre stage of national debate.”
Project Details
We are working to automate their case-work management so every case is tracked from day one up to the last follow-up in order to provide timely and quality service and data generated from case-work are managed well to generate critical analysis and research outcomes.
HAQ provides legal cum psychosocial and rehabilitative support to children who are victims of crimes. The team consists of social workers, counselors, lawyers, researchers, and their supervisors. Currently, they are dealing with more than 500 cases of children who have been victims of sexual abuse. Each case goes through various stages and thus, each stage needs to be documented and digitized.
Here are primary activities that need to be done:
* Efficient casework management
* Tracking the developments and interventions in each case through all stages for providing timely and quality service
* Establishing an easy and efficient reporting system
* Generating time-bound alerts
* Enhancing team coordination and efficiency in general
* Quick data analytics
* Generating data analysis that feeds into or can be used for systematic research
The main users of the system include:
* Assistant Social Worker
* Social Worker
* Director of Restoration Care
* Director of Legal Intervention
* Counselor
* Lawyer
After various interactions, we have developed the complete workflow for the case-work management.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: August 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/haq-cms-phase-2-update/
==================================================

Last year, we implemented the
Case Management System (CMS) for HAQ
as a part of the second cohort. The application is extensively used by the HAQ team and more than 1000 cases have been created in the application. They reached out to us to add some enhancements that will help them to streamline the current process. This phase of the HAQ development included tweaking existing modules, adding a few new functionalities and also changing a few workflows due to new government policies.
Prior to CMS implementation HAQ used conventional file and paper approaches to do their jobs hence, some of the processes where based on that. After using CMS they found more areas that could be automated and revised/updated their existing policies & logic for the data collection.
In this development phase, their requirement was focused mainly on the following areas:
Estimation of more reliable and accurate reports
Updating existing forms, and data representation for various user roles
Updating methods and the computation for different elements
Here are primary activities that were carried out:
Creation of a new training module
Generating a calendar-based monitoring system to track the court hearing for lawyers
Consolidated data export list
Add & update various data collection forms
Reporting error fixes and changes according to the new requirements
Dashboard update with more information
We have also built some custom functionality that is part of the dashboard.
The project is completed and has been deployed on the production server. We are waiting for final feedback from HAQ team.Title: HAQ/TISS – Extending Primero to generate complex report
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: August 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/haq-tiss-extending-primero-to-generate-complex-report/
==================================================

One of our previous
post
was on the issues and their solutions that we faced while implementing HAQ using Primero. In the same post, we had mentioned that Primero supports generating reports only from those fields whose predefined option values are already stored in DB which means reports could not include values entered by the users via the text fields. Due to this limitation, we were forced to look out for third-party tools like Metabase/Superset for report generation, however, after evaluation, it seemed using these tools would be more complex as direct integration was not available. Creating reports was also a major part of another project TISS which we are working as a part of Tech4Dev initiative. Hence we moved forward with extending Primero to include reports by using MVC architecture of RoR. You can find below a brief explanation of what we actually did.
RoR MVC
We have an app folder which contains view, controllers, models, assets etc.
RoR MVC has a routes.rb file in config folder which is used to route an URL to a specific controller. The controller then defines which view to be called.
RoR creates a database file for every model. The controller controls the data and is then passed to the corresponding view specified in the routes.rb file.
Reports Generation.
We added a custom reports section to the navigation bar.
Primero uses CouchDB as back-end. Retrieving data from the database is done using CouchDB views.
Views are specified in the corresponding model (whose database is present in CouchDB) from where the data is to be fetched. You can access the view by calling it in the controller using Model.view_name
Processing of the reports is done followed by invoking the corresponding HTML page.
For retrieving data from the controller and displaying on the HTML page we used instance variables which are defined using @variable_name where “@” indicates instance variable and can be used in the HTML page as well.
After implementing reports, as we were nearing the wrap up of TISS implementation the next big task in our bucket was to setup a production environment for Primero. Mentioning below a brief explanation of steps followed and the hurdles we came across. (Note: Entire procedure takes at least an hour. )
Prerequisites
A?local machine which will be used to deploy the setup and a server which should only contain a sudo less user.
The local machine should contain chefdk and kinfe solo. (ChefDk and kinfe solo version are very important as specified
here
Steps
Checkout the branch you want to deploy on the production server.
In the cookbook, folder make a dev-node.json file as specified
here
In the dev-node.json file, the server_hostname field should contain the domain name of the production server which is used for Let?s?Encrypt certification.
Follow steps mentioned in the given links
https://github.com/primeroIMS/primero/blob/maint_1.6/cookbook/README.md
https://community.primero.org/t/how-can-i-quickly-set-up-primero/183
Issue encountered and its solution
Production setup would halt during ruby bundle install, it tried to install ruby bundle using the system ruby instead of?installing?ruby 2.4.3 railsexpress.
To resolve this issue, we changed the actual way in which Primero installs ruby 2.4.3 railsexpress. (briefly explained
here
)
Inside cookbook/recipes/application.rb in the local machine change the line
“rvm install #{node[:primero][:ruby_version]} -n #{node[:primero][:ruby_patch]} –patch #{node[:primero][:ruby_patch]}”
?to
“rvm install #{node[:primero][:ruby_version]} -n #{node[:primero][:ruby_patch]}”
It was a good learning experience using Primero as we got an opportunity to explore different technology/tools. Along the path, we also faced many challenges which were worth the efforts.Title: Happy Holidays from Project Tech4Dev

==================================================

This is an update we shared via email with the community and our funders. Posting it here, in case you are not on either of those lists 🙂
We want to take this time to thank our community for supporting us over the past couple of years.
The financial stability that our generous funders have provided us has made our life a lot easier. As you are aware, this year has been radically different, but we feel quite good about our approach and our pivot towards focussing on our open-source platforms while giving our NGO partners the space to handle the pandemic within their organization and programs.
A few highlights for Tech4Dev over the past year (Jan – Dec 2020)
Glific
– our two-way communication platform has had tremendous traction within the NGO community in India. In the
span of 7 months
, we’ve gone from a concept to a working product and have
10+ NGOs
paying to use the SaaS platform. We got a
significant grant from Omidyar Network India for Glific
and will be exploring opportunities to collaborate on open source technology with ON.
We got a head start working with NGOs in the first quarter of 2020. Thanks to the early start, we managed to deliver solutions to
20+ NGOs
via Tech4Dev.
The third-cohort NGOs have used a communication platform to deliver timely messages to their communities during the pandemic. In particular, we are proud of the work done by
Saajha
and
Reap Benefit
. The common thread in their work was the combination of personal and automated conversations with their beneficiaries. Their learnings have been incorporated into Glific.
We i
ncubated the
FundImpact platform
– a grant management system for NGOs to consolidate budget expenditures and project performance in one place. The platform allows NGOs to automate the routine & monotonous reporting work. FundImpact will facilitate hundreds of NGOs across India in reducing their efforts on reporting project performance and managing grants from donors.
For the
Avni Project
, digitizing the community health projects for organizations like
JSS
and
ASHWINI
,covering all their vertical programs was the big milestone achieved in 2020. Avni is now
full-featured fieldwork and beneficiary MIS
for community-based organizations.
On behalf of all of us at Project Tech4Dev, we wish you and your families a happy and safe holiday season. Please take care.

Author: ericamiglani
Date: May 2024
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/harnessing-technology-for-social-good-insights-from-jp-morgan-chases-impact-socials-event/
==================================================

Earlier this month I had the opportunity to be part of the first edition of Impact Socials event organised by JP Morgan Chase. The gathering had a good mix of nonprofits(Sensing Local,i-Saksham, LAHI,Netri,Sattva, Nudge to name a few), and technology partners(LinkedIn, Microsoft, Atlassian,Salesforce, Zoho, Scratch) the sessions were thoughtfully curated for valuable exchanges to happen. The day started with a closed door session bringing together nonprofit partners and technology providers. The objective of this session was to bring forth challenges faced by social good organizations and how technology can help them to achieve their full potential.
Summarising below
6
key reflections from the discussions that happened during this session coupled with some actionable insights. I believe these also represent broader trends of the sector:
1. Embracing Technology – A Balanced Perspective
:
It was encouraging to see many non-profits recognising the potential of technology to scale their programs, help them make data-driven decisions, and enable automation. On the one hand, the conviction and trust I heard in the voices of the nonprofit leaders regarding technologys ability to solve their problems was exciting, however it is important to remember that technology is not a panacea. Tech is a powerful tool, but its success depends on the organisation having the right processes in place. We must understand the specific purpose of each tech tool to ensure it meets our needs without expecting it to solve all problems.
2. Navigating the AI Buzz
:
AI is the latest trend and its potential to transform our work is immense. While its important not to get swept away in the hype or fear of missing out, it’s equally crucial to invest time in understanding AI’s capabilities and how it can enhance our program outcomes. AI is a powerful tool. It can analyze vast amounts of data, uncover patterns, and provide insights that were previously unattainable. Therefore, it’s worth the effort to explore AI thoroughly and consider its adoption. Ensure that its use aligns with your organization’s goals and that you have a good understanding of its potential impact.
3. Enhancing Discoverability:
One challenge that was heard in the room was on discoverability both for nonprofits seeking tech solutions and for tech providers trying to reach nonprofits. I have now come to realise that building awareness is a gradual process. Events like Impact Socials are crucial for fostering partnerships and growth. Networks are incredibly valuable and can significantly amplify your reach. Seeing others championing your work, especially to new audiences, is immensely fulfilling. A special shoutout to Laxman P Joshi@Ekyam and Prashant Mekaraj@JPMC for being champions of Project Tech4Dev at this event
4. Prioritizing Interoperability:
We should acknowledge that many tech challenges faced by nonprofits have already been addressed hence its beneficial for nonprofits to explore adopting existing off-the-shelf solutions than developing custom solutions. Reach out to people in the tech community who are equipped with the needed knowledge and skills, for guidance – you could reach out to us at Project Tech4Dev, Tech4Good, Dhwani RIS to name a few who were present at the event. Interoperability is key; new platforms should integrate seamlessly with existing systems that nonprofits are using to ensure ease of adoption. The focus when designing tech platforms should be on simple, intuitive designs that minimize the need for extensive retraining.
5. Shifting from Sales Pitches to Genuine Understanding
:
Some nonprofit partners expressed concern that tech providers are more focused on selling their products than understanding the nonprofits’ unique needs and contexts. It’s important to approach these interactions with trust and openness. Tech providers dedicated to the social sector often have deep insights into its challenges and constraints. The feeling should not be that one needs the other more but actually thinking that both need each other equally. Nonprofits should focus on articulating their needs clearly and engage in thoughtful discussions with the tech partner to determine if a tool truly meets their requirements. Both parties should see the relationship as a mutual partnership rather than a one-sided transaction.
6. Ensuring Quality at Scale
:
Another significant discussion point in the room was maintaining quality while scaling programs. Achieving scale is a major win in the development sector, but it’s important not to lose sight of quality. Start with small pilots to test feasibility and impact, iterate based on learnings, and develop detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency. Implementing quality checks, building staff capacity, and regularly collecting feedback from beneficiaries and partners are essential steps to maintaining high standards of quality
The session was overall able to trigger the right notes for further discussions and collaborations.
A Day of Inspiration and Collaboration
The rest of the day included lightning talks from tech partners serving the social sector, sharing their journeys, offerings, and insights on common pitfalls for nonprofits embarking on tech initiatives. Two panel discussions one on the power of data and another on measuring impact rounded out the day, highlighting the critical role of data in driving effective social change.
Overall, it was a day well spent among nonprofit leaders and changemakers. The event sparked new ideas, initiated promising collaborations, and reinforced some existing views.Title: Hasiru Dala – About dry waste collection centres
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: November 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/hasiru-dala-about-dry-waste-collection-centres/
==================================================

I am not an expert in waste. So at a very broad level if we consider waste to be dry and wet – this blog is about how dry waste is managed in Bangalore. Dry waste mainly consists of plastics, paper, metal, glass.
There are a few ways in which these waste end up getting handed over from consumer to the first step in the recycling chain.
1. They are picked up by the door to door collection vehicles
2. We drop them off to dry waste collection centres
3. We sell them to waste pickers
4. Waste pickers pick them up from roads and public places
Door to door collection drop these waste to Dry waste collection centres (DWCC). Each ward in Bangalore has a DWCC run by independent entrepreneurs who come from waste picker community – with support from BBMP and Hasiru Dala. Here the dry waste is sorted into different categories and then sold to the private recyclers.
Hasiru Dala helps the waste pickers via training and systems in managing the DWCC in a sustainable way. One important part of this system is to maintain data of incoming, outgoing and sales information for various types/sub-types of waste. This is one of few data sources we have for Bangalore that quantifies the amount of dry waste.
Currently this data system in on excel, which makes it difficult to use (analysing, reporting, gaining operational insights). Needless to say, the quality of data is not reliable since it is excel.
We have started the development of the data management system that where all this information will be fed from all the wards in Bangalore. The tech stack is React, Java/Spring, React Admin, Postgres and Metabase.Title: Hasiru Dala – Data Management System
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: March 2019

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/hasiru-dala-data-management-system/
==================================================

Hasiru Dala
(HD) is an organisation based in Bangalore, with operations throughout Karnataka, working for the waste pickers and waste management. Their key operations are:
1. HD’s field-based
social workers provide social security services
to waste pickers and their families. These include helping them get government ids, opening bank accounts, getting loans, availing various government schemes, etc. HD supports around 6000 waste-pickers, their 20000 family members, via around 25 social workers.
2. HD runs various regular
community activities and events
for the above population.
3. Help waste pickers in running the
dry waste collection centres (DWCC)
. These wards in all the wards of Bangalore.
4.
Library
for children of waste pickers.
Most of these activities are constantly growing to more and more places in Karnataka.
Not surprisingly, underlying all these services/activities, there is data. Currently, this is managed in form of excels/spreadsheets to some extent but they suffer from regular problems of data management in such a way – completeness, quality, versions, access, inability to analyse, and so on. It is also difficult to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness of the service delivered.
Hence, like most organisations, HD needs a data management system for their core service work. Since social workers work from the field and do not have access to computer necessarily, there is a need for a mobile based component to access this system. In other cases (like DWCC) there is no one available who can be depended upon for the data management, but HD has data entry people who do it on their behalf.
From the solution perspective item 1 & 2, is planned to be done using OpenCHS. We plan to use custom web application for items 3 & 4, needing low surface area integration with OpenCHS. The users will be able to use the system via a single login, spanning across both the applications. OpenCHS will allow social workers to take advantage of features like work schedule management.
The complete system will be delivered in roughly 9-10 months, consisting of 5-6 releases. The development for the project has started in last week of February. The project management structure will be put in place very soon.Title: Hasiru Dala – Koha, Integrated Library System , Configuration

==================================================

Koha
Koha is a cost-effective, high-performing online library system management software. It links with all the other libraries in a consortium, with easy links to other important services, customizable reports and tools. It has loads of great features such as user-created public and private lists, fine collection and management, bulk deletion and record editing, cataloging, collection inventory and management, customizable staff permission limits, inter-library loan tracking, and so on.
Features
Koha is a web-based ILS, with a SQL database (
MySQL
preferred) backend with cataloguing data stored in
MARC
and accessible via
Z39.50
or
SRU
. The
user interface
is very configurable and adaptable and has been translated into many languages.
[3]
Koha has most of the features that would be expected in an ILS, including:
Various
Web 2.0
facilities like tagging, comment, Social sharing and
RSS feeds
Union catalog facility
Customizable search
Online Circulation
Barcode printing
Requirement of Library Management System for Hasiru Dala
Hasiru Dala (HD) is an organisation based in Bangalore, with operations throughout Karnataka, working for the waste pickers and waste management. In a
previous post
discussed about their key operations. One of those is
Library for children of waste pickers,
The Buguri library at Banashankari, one of the community library operated by Hasiru Dala was once an empty space above an old-age home that now stores over 2,000 books and a whole lot of hope for the rag pickers’ children of the slums nearby. And hence the requirement for the Integrated Library Management System (ILMS)
Koha
.
Setup & Configuration
Setting up of Koha instance was a straight forward with help from
documentation
. We started with aws EC2 micro instance and started configuring the Koha system after setup. We upgraded the server later to EC2 small instance because the system was crashing on search and other database intensive operations.
It took us around a week’s time to understand the terminology and technicalities of Koha system, it is important to know the jargon used in the library ecosystem to configure and use Koha. For example, a book is catalogued and individual book is called  an item. Each book in the library is an item uniquely tagged using some form of barcode number.
Users and subscribers are called Patrons and have Patron Category from one of the 6 types defined in Koha.
Adult
Child
Staff
Organizational
Professional
Statistical
Challenges faced
Being a standard format for library system, there were many fields in the registration forms for patron.
One particular requirement was different types of registration form for different category of patron. Which Koha does not allow directly. We implemented this using a custom field called
Extended Patron Attributes
.
Koha allows a particular field to be linked to either all or one type of patron category if you need to show a field to 2 types of patron category you need to define the same field twice with different names.
Books can not be transferred or issued without using a barcode number of that item.
Configuring Koha takes more time because of application is made in the traditional approach of server side rendering of UI, which requires loading a page quite a lot. For an application which has a lot of configuration, this slows down the setup process.
Limitations of Koha
Lack of using custom barcode formats
Lack of custom auto generated member id
Customization of registration form is not easy enough
Patron permission can not be configured based on patron categories, permission has to be set up individually for each patron.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/hasiru-dala-requirement-analysis-and-openchs-missing-features/
==================================================

Previous post in this series
We decided to use
OpenCHS
for social security services provided by social workers because it fits most of the use cases, even though we initially created OpenCHS for field health workers. OpenCHS really seems to fit many fieldwork use cases,
Dam Desilting Mission
being the other one.
But since these are initial use cases outside health we were small expecting feature gaps. Also, contributing to the gaps is the fact that some of these are also requirements in the health domain we hadn’t thought of it. Let’s look at what all we found from analysing Hasiru Dala’s requirements.
Beneficiary’s Picture
While the social security services are provided by social workers in a small catchment and they generally know the beneficiaries. But the social worker could change or initially social worker may not remember all faces. Identification using IDs, phone numbers could be difficult because many do not have them – exactly the reason social security services are being provided to them. A picture of the waste picker in the app could help in making the identification oneself or by asking around in the community.
Since in OpenCHS we already have the ability to capture photos and save them, this was kind of no brainer for us to include.
Document upload
Waste pickers have a very precarious existence with very few facilities available to them. Ability to securely keep their IDs, Bank account, scheme papers etc is quite challenging. They often lose them, which of course sets them back. (From the initial workshop, I remember the story explained to us – of a basti (small slum) catching fire and the waste pickers who lived there lost most of their papers.
Ability to securely store the documents is an important part of the service being provided. This will also potentially save, the social workers trip to the beneficiaries home just to get the documents.
Again this feature is closely linked to image and video upload in OpenCHS.
Printing beneficiary’s profile
BBMP, the municipal government of Bangalore, wants to create a paper-based recording system for the waste pickers. Hasiru Dala is the main organisation that works for the informal waste pickers in Karnataka. It works closely with the municipal governments. Hence this system will end up becoming a key database of waste pickers.
In terms of OpenCHS what this requires a 1-2 page profile of each waste picker which can be printed out. Since we already have started the web version of OpenCHS application, this printing could be done from it. Ordinarily, this could be done easily in any application but since OpenCHS is a generic platform, unaware of implementation (HD) specific needs, this requires a bit of pluggability facility in the platform.
(Since we have done something similar in Bahmni where each hospital required a different discharge summary, referral letter, this is a familiar territory :-)).
Working around the lack of family feature
The social workers register the waste pickers as well as their family members as beneficiaries in the system. In most cases, the address of all family members is the same. Ideally, this should be modelled as Family and Individuals and address should be captured against the family. But currently, this feature is not present in OpenCHS (although present in this year’s roadmap). Given everything else OpenCHS product team has to make, we didn’t have space for it. Hence we came up with a workaround.
The workaround is really to use the rules to pre-populate the address of each beneficiary from another existing beneficiary. This could be done because OpenCHS does have a relationship feature.Title: Hasiru Dala – Software architecture and tech stack
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/hasiru-dala-software-architecture-and-tech-stack/
==================================================

As described in
a previous post
Hasiru Dala provides multiple services to the waste pickers. These services are independent of each other to a great extent as far as developing a software system for it goes. I also described our choice for using OpenCHS for part of the system – social security and community activities. In this post, I fill up some details around tech stack and integration.
We have decided that we will be developing a custom web application for dry water collection centre’s (DWCC) data management. Regarding library we might still use an open source product, we are still evaluating this. Before we get into integration let’s quickly get into the tech stack for DWCC.
At Samanvay we have standardised on a tech stack for such systems. We have standardised because the tech stack we have chosen has been based on discussion, research, spikes/trials etc. Over a period of time, we keep evaluating the components of the tech stack and add/remove from it. But when we start a new project of the similar type we just go with tech stack we have standardised on. At Samanvay we need to work on multiple projects, hence a standard tech stack allows for seamlessly switching across projects. While it reduces variety but it does allow us to get deeper and deeper in the tech components and get the most out of them. The tech stack for DWCC is Postgres, Spring, Java, React, embedded React Admin, and Metabase (unless we switch to Superset based on our evaluation).
Integration across three subsystems
The need for integration across these subsystems arises because they are serving the same beneficiary. Though apart from some basic beneficiary information not much needs to be shared. The beneficiary information would be first be created in the system by the social workers using OpenCHS.
To achieve this integration these non-OpenCHS subsystems will pull this information from OpenCHS using the API. These subsystems also need to store this information in their own database so that they can present this information in the reports/extracts to its users (since the reports cannot easily and performantly access the API).
Lastly for library we are evaluating
Koha
. If this works out, we will need to pull data from OpenCHS and populate the children data into its database.Title: Heres how a chat platform can improve human lives

==================================================

The quality of information a person can access, can be a direct indicator of the quality of life they live. For some of the more vulnerable sections of society, it can play an even crucial role. In the most recent example of the COVID-19 pandemic, information became a matter of life and death. The right information can also be a key to accessing all other necessities such as food, shelter, clean water etc?For someone who doesn?t have access to the basic necessities, information on obtaining it can make all the difference.
In our ever so connected world, a conversation or interaction is a source for any key information, with the potential to change a life. What nonprofit organizations do on a daily basis is to have these key conversations with members of the weaker sections of society. Bringing about an upliftment to the society requires such ongoing conversations. However, there?s an unmet need to stay connected and send out quality information through crucial conversations. We believe it can be made better through technology, through a chat platform that can help nonprofits keep up with the needs. There are various aspects to conversations that a chat platform can handle such as,
1. Removing human where it is not required but bringing it back when it?s needed the most
While some conversations can be deeply personal requiring individual attention, others can also be generic. The chat platform can allow nonprofits to handle each case efficiently. A set of automated messages engaging a beneficiary in the conversation will allow some of the generic conversation to be handled by the machine. When a more intimate input is required, a human can be alerted to take over.
2. Immediate and long-term support for each beneficiary
A record of conversations can allow the support to be built for longer periods. For areas such as employability, or education, staying connected over the long term can be beneficial to keep progressing with meaningful conversations. On the other hand, critical health-related conversations can be identified for a quicker response. Thus allowing the nonprofits to reach the beneficiaries and tackle the information challenges both immediately and long term.
3. Reduce language barriers
Some of the basic language support required to understand people from different communities can be solved via direct translations between different languages. And while language barriers cannot be eliminated since the use of colloquial, multilingual, and transliterated approaches can make a message more complex for the computer to understand, it can definitely enable and carry out a large part of simpler interactions.
4. Handle information dissemination at a scale
The most pressing requirement is to reach out to a large number of people. Hearing from many organizations, it became evident that IVR methodologies and using group chats on platforms such as WhatsApp weren?t very effective in handling large numbers. Hence, the right tools need to be built to use what exists and to eliminate the challenges it posits.
5. An intelligent interaction system
By building intelligence into the system that learns from conversations, and provides prompts and suggestions for replies, an ever-evolving structure can be laid down. Using the latest technology such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, the platform can get better as more conversations take place. This enhances the quality of conversations as opposed to always having it the same way through manual interaction methods.
6. A visible indication of improvement in lives
The chat platform can enable the measurement of the quality of conversations and its ability to impact lives. It can allow all voices to be heard by making sure that the messages get responded to. Visual reports can indicate the adjustments required to be made, in response to the insights generated from analytics.
Conversations are key to moving the society ahead but we don?t need more technology to chat. We need technology to be placed at the right intersection of human conversations that advance human lives. By creating tools that promote the quality of information sharing through meaningful conversations, the human lives that need it most can be reached at the right time by those who can reach them. This led to the inception of an open-source two-way chat platform between nonprofits and their beneficiaries.

==================================================

As I fly back from a 5-week long visit to India, I feel blessed with all that I could experience – the humanity, humility and humour around me. I got an opportunity to visit multiple NGOs, starting with Goonj in Delhi, Akshay Patra in Ahmedabad, Aangan Trust in Delhi and Video Volunteers in Goa. I took my family along to the first two during our vacation in the first 3 weeks. As part of my franctional CxO role I spent a whole day with the Aagan Trust at their team offsite, with over 100 employees. My last week was in sunny Goa! This post is about the Tech4Dev quarterly sprint in Goa, where over 50 NGOs joined us over a period of 10 days for various Tech4Dev initiatives like
Avni
,
Glific
,
Dalgo
and
fCxO
.
Sunset at Anjuna Beach
We did a lot, but a few sessions were highlights for me, and I certainly had plenty of take-aways from these:
Glific Quarterly Retrospective
Techie for Dev Team Awards
T4D Chai per Charcha
Informal ‘fun’ Sunday
Connects over meals, walks and one-on-ones
Glific Sprint
Video Volunteers NGO visit
The Tech4Dev team has grown!!
From my experience of how busy the sprint at Kochi was, I realized that if I had to accomplish something, I had to do it on the first day at the sprint, and put it on the calendar, else it won’t happen. To bring everyone in the Glific team together, we planned for a retrospective of the last 3 months, to celebrate our work, and to learn from our blunders. Thanks to everyone’s participation, it went as planned. Akansha describes the session in further detail in her
blog
. For our hurrays, we all applauded for team members involved in specific initiatives, and the team members were asked to stand (and take a bow – no one did). It was fun!
Team busy reading outcomes of the retrospective brainstorming
The ‘Techie for Dev’ team awards were hilarious. Krishna and Shamoon, along with others from the team did a fantastic job on award categories that matched everyone idiosyncrasies. I got the “Calendar Keeda” award (the paragraph above proves it right!). Some the awards that struck me were – sorry but not sorry award for Lobo’s blunt and straight-to-the-point attitude, Calendar Keeda award, and Social Butterfly award for Krishna. The award presentation was very funny, thanks to some impromptu performances from Shamoon, Akhilesh, Krishna, Tejas, Ankit and others.
Sunday was a break day, with team building activities in the morning. I enjoyed the activity, but not the discussion after or the heat during the day. Shamoon elaborates on the day in his
blog
. The highlight though for me was the evening at Anjuna beach with the team. I have never spent time at a beach after dark. Night’s darkness hides the mess on the beach, the yellow lights on the shacks highlights the waves crashing on the sand and the mild moonlight is a cherry on top. It seemed like a place of zen.
Monday had the first big event planned – Chai pe Charcha. Gautam’s idea of bringing local Goan NGOs to the sprint for a few hours helped all of us explore what we do and how we do it. Sangeeta talks about this in
her blog
. Behind the scenes, it took a solid 3 weeks to ideate, brainstorm with Gautam and Sneha, and get the ball rolling. With the help from internal leaders like Lobo, Erica, and Ankit, we got warm introductions to Video Volunteers, Red Dot, Give India, Rebuild, and a few others who helped spread the word. Fast forward to January, we started with 3 RSVPs in the first week, then 10 in the second and finally 25 in the last few days before the sprint, thanks to close follow-ups. Though we had only 11 NGOs from Goa join on the day, some drop-ins from Data Catalyst Program and Glific sprint, made all of it worth it. Gautam and Deeksha were working right upto the last hour. The outcome – a well planned event that didn’t show up any glitches (even though the planners know there were a few!).
A few take-aways I had were – 1) Goans are very punctual, we had 4 NGOs show up exactly at 2pm (when we started), 2) We should wrap up hands-on work before the sprint, we were working on posters all the way till the eleventh hour and 3) that things won’t go as planned, be flexible to change as needed impromptu.
Individual connects and group talks over meals, were a definite highlight for me. I thrive on 1:1 connections, and I’d an opportunity to do so with the Glific team, as well as with others in Tech4Dev during the morning walks (thanks to Lobo, who is the accountability partner for most). I made new friends, specially calling out Arun, who awed me with the energy he brought not just to the walks but the talks and celebrations we had. I don’t go for walks everyday at home, so the fact that my steps account everyday were between 13-15K steps even though we were indoors all day, was an achievement in itself. These made my days long, especially since work start from 8am until 8pm, but I slept at night feeling content with the outcome of the day.
The group got bigger into the week. All of us @ Anjuna Beach at 7am
First morning walk towards Baga beach – fishermen returning from their morning catch
We had two parallel NGO events – Data catalyst program and the Glific sprint, I was majorly part of the Glific sprint, headed by Tejas and Krishna, and supported by everyone in the team We had 16 NGOs attend, the highest so far. I learnt a lot about the work NGOs do with Glific. The talks by TAP, INREM, Udhyam, Civis, and Bandhu were very insightful. Discussions on challenges and problems all these 16 NGOs face and brainstorming session facilitated by Glific team leading to possible solutions, went as planned, with conversations that will go on after the sprint among these NGOs. There was a lot to take away from the future of platform session that asked NGOs to vote on what they would like to see on Glific platform. Some of the high priorities that came up included improving existing pain points in restarting flows and interactive messages, and improving the metrics that can be leveraged to reach a broader segment of end users by the NGOs. The Glific product team has a tall order of things to follow-up on, post a successful Glific sprint. Kudos to the team!
Glific Sprint Opening Circle with 16 NGOs
On the last day, Lobo, Thomas and I enjoyed some amazing Goan food at Britto’s on Baga beach, and visited Video Volunteers (a local NGO in Goa). Ashwini, Erica and Ishan also joined us. I’m humbled by the energy and passion that Jessica and Stalin (the founders) exhilarate. Video Volunteers are 15 years strong and going. They train content creators in urban and rural parts of India on taking video of issues that are local to them. They promote local journalism in the true sense. These videos are edited and documented by VV team, and uploaded on youtube, and are taken to the local govt officials for grievance reporting. They also use Facebook and instagram to raise awareness and build support to hold the govt accountable. We visited them at their office in Arpora, Goa, in a 100 year old house. Our discussions lasted over 2.5 hours in a very comfortable baithak style room, with 2 rounds of delicious chai. Thank you for having us Video Volunteers.
Tech4Dev team at Video Volunteers NGO in Goa.
This sprint was my first as a Tech4Dev employee. Though I visited in Kochi three months back, this time I got an immersive experience, from being involved in ideation, to planning and then to execution of it all. At the end of it, I don’t feel tired or overwhelmed. I feel happy, content and accomplished. Its all about the human touch, … virtual interactions just don’t do it. Looking forward to the next one in 3 months!
Reflections of the sprint!!Title: How #Tech4Good improved discoverability and funding sources for Vasantham Federation of Differently Abled

==================================================

Arriving at Vasantham Federation of Differently Abled, one was immediately struck by the remoteness of the office, tucked away in a corner of Thiruvallur District, blistering not only in the humidity & heat of the harsh Tamil Nadu sun but also with the urgency of its cause. The weather conditions seemed to bring out the challenges Vasantham Federation endured daily, with technicolour clarity.
Here was a group of differently abled women & men, not dejected and crippled by fatalism, but full of purpose and a drive to overturn assumptions.
They narrated incidents of how they were disenfranchised at every step towards securing a better life for themselves and others in their community. A collective that relied mostly on donation boxes, they were turned away by every shop owner they approached and every house they went to. It was urgent and important for them to become sustainable so that they can continue to do the impactful work they do.
Could technology prove to be their most reliable and empowering friend yet?
Like many small and growing community based organisations doing great work – it was difficult for a prospective supporter or donor to ?discover? vasantham and its work online. Our first task was to give them an online presence. Vasantham ensured that we were given all the content needed to build a presence for them. We used WordPress to build their website as it?s easy to manage and we needed them to feel confident about navigating and updating their own website. We also ensured that they have an active presence on social media. Now that they could be discovered – we wanted to make sure that donors could effortlessly support them financially. We reached out to our friends at Razorpay and set up a payment page for them! And within weeks, Vasantham Federation?s fundraising efforts weren?t being turned away but turned around.
We are happy to share that Vasantham Federation has started raising money online (INR 14K in 2 weeks), but in order to make this a sustainable undertaking, we are helping them build a communication strategy using Email, Social Media marketing so they keep their donors engaged, and find new donors using innovative ways. You can check out Vasantham?s
Website
and we also encourage you to make a small donation towards the important work through this
simple payment page
we set up for them. Even a 100 INR donation can go a long way in helping their cause.
We at Tech4Good are committed to amplifying the impact of the civil society ecosystem for organisations like Vasantham where they feel supported, can thrive and scale the impact of their work. So, we have created a recipe that other NGOs can also use to improve discoverability and diversify supporter base and funding!

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: May 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/how-a-bill-becomes-a-zombie-the-journey-of-section-66a-of-the-information-technology-act-2000/
==================================================

Tl;dr
Section 66A of the Information Technology Act (?IT Act?), 2000, was enacted into the statute through an amendment in 2008. The section penalised sending “offensive messages” via online communication. Owing to excessive vagueness in the laws, the provision was often abused by enforcement authorities and ran the risk of a chilling effect on speech over the internet. In 2015, the section was deemed unconstitutional by the Hon?ble Supreme Court of India in
Shreya Singhal v Union of India
. However, despite repeated directions by the Supreme Court, the most recent in 2019, the provision
continues to be invoked
across the country. In
an earlier article
we highlighted continued prosecutions under Section 66A, as recently as March 2020. In this post we trace the journey of Section 66A of the IT Act from 2008 to 2020.
The Genesis
The Information Technology Act, 2000 (?IT Act?) was enacted to provide a legal framework for the promotion of e-commerce and e-transactions in the country. In 2005,
an expert committee was set up
to review the IT Act to address the need for regulating cyber forensics and cyber crime, facilitating and promoting the growth of electronic governance and commerce, and complying with international security practices and procedures. The committee
submitted its report
with recommendations on a range of issues including computer related crime and electronic evidence.
On December 15, 2006, The  Information Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2006 was introduced in the Lok Sabha. It proposed introducing new provisions to deal with new forms of crimes like, sending offensive emails and multimedia messages, child pornography, cyber terrorism, publishing sexually explicit materials in electronic form, video voyeurism, e-commerce frauds like cheating by personation (phishing), identity theft, etc.
It was through this process that Section 66A was integrated into the IT Act. The provision was aimed to deal with cyber crimes against women, especially to punish those sending ?
vulgar mobile phone SMSes to women?
. The Bill was then referred to the Standing Committee On Information Technology, which was headed by Shri Nikhil Kumar on 19th December 2006. In a
unanimous report
on the proposed amendments, the standing committee, while suggesting many changes to the proposed bill, did not express any concern over the possible misuse of S. 66A.
On December 22, 2008, the Lok Sabha passed eight bills, sans debate. One of those was the 2006 Amendment Bill passed as the IT Amendment Act, 2008 (?Amendment Act?) which amended the IT Act, formally introducing Section 66A which penalised sending “offensive messages” . The Amendment Act was passed in the Rajya Sabha on the next day.
In the session that began immediately after the Mumbai attacks on November 26, 2008, the Parliament prioritised legislations which were linked by an apparent aim to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the security of India. These were the National Investigation Agency Act, Unlawful Activities Prevention (Amendement) Act and the Information Technology (Amendment) Act. The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 when passed was primarily projected as an anti-terrorism  amendment  to  thwart  future  terrorist  attacks  such  as  the  November  26, 2008  terror  attacks  in  Mumbai.  The Amendment Act was passed,
with an emphasis on terrorism and cyber crime
, to allow authorities to intercept messages from mobile phones, computers and other communication devices, and block websites in the interest of national security.
Further, on both days, the
functioning of the two houses was severely disrupted by Opposition members raising a ruckus over comments made by the then minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay
questioning the circumstances of the death of a police officer in the 2008 Mumbai Terror attacks. In consequence, the Amendment Act was
discussed for only 21 minutes in the Lok Sabha
and passed without debate in the Rajya Sabha.
The Amendment Act came into force with effect from October 27, 2009.
The life of S.66A
The said amendment was
criticised severely
on grounds of :
being violative of people?s fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression; and
subjective terminology which permits law enforcement agencies to mold its definition at their desire and willingness to interpret it.
Since the insertion of Section 66A, wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. One, particularly
infamous, incident was the arrest of two girls in Mumbai over a Facebook post
criticising the bandh in Maharashtra on the death of the Shiv Sena Chief,  Bal Thackerey, in November 2012. One of them had posted the allegedly illegal content, while another simply ?liked? it. Within hours of the post and subsequent ?like?, the two were arrested and charged under S.295A of  the Indian Penal Code and S. 66A of the IT Act. Although the girls were released later and the criminal charges against them were dropped, it
evoked
severe criticism all over the country. The general sentiment was that the police had misused its power by invoking S. 66A as a weapon to stifle political dissent, as opposed to regulating harmful content.
Shocked by the blatant misuse of the law, a Public Interest Litigation (?PIL?) petition was filed, in November 2012, seeking to declare S. 66A of the IT Act, 2000 as unconstitutional. This commenced the process of one of India?s and even the
world?s
most significant internet law judgements in modern history.
During the pendency of the case, a
question was posed in July 2014, before the Rajya Sabha inquiring if the Government considered amending Section 66A due to concerns of misuse .
The Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad,  answered that the provisions were considered to be in line with the fundamental constitutional provisions. He stated that detailed discussions were held by Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee (?CRAC?) with stakeholders including industry associations, intermediaries, civil society actors and users on the effect of Section 66A. These discussions purportedly found that the law itself was appropriate, but steps were needed to minimise the likelihood of abuse or misuse.
Accordingly, the Central Government issued an Advisory dated 9th January 2013 prohibiting any arrest pursuant to Section 66A unless such arrest was approved by senior police officers. The Supreme Court , in the PIL challenging the validity of S.66A,  directed all the States / Union Territories to ensure compliance to the Advisory before effecting arrest under S. 66A of IT Act.
On March 24, 2015 the Hon?ble Supreme Court of India passed a landmark judgement in the matter of
Shreya Singhal v Union of India
. The Hon?ble Supreme Court relied on international human rights and Indian constitutional benchmarks to hold that Section 66A of the IT Act arbitrarily and disproportionately affected the right to free speech.
The Court agreed with the the petitioner?s contention that S. 66A is capable of limiting all forms of internet communications as it makes no distinction ?between mere discussion or advocacy of a particular point of view, which may be annoying or inconvenient or grossly offensive to some and incitement by which such words lead to an imminent causal connection with public disorder, security of State etc.? [para. 20] The Court found that S.66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalise even innocent speech.
The effect of this decision would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A
.
The 66A Zombies rise
In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have had a neat  conclusion wherein people are no longer prosecuted or punished under an unconstitutional law. However, a
2018 study by Gupta and Sekhri
highlighted the continued use of Section 66A, including fresh cases
registered
in police stations,
investigated
and,
considered
by lower Courts, even after the Shreya Singhal decision. The authors described the continued use of the provision as a ?Legal Zombie?. They acknowledged that the study was based on limited data. The study postulates that
that there has been no change in the text of the statute book, through an amendment. Commercial publishers attempted to remedy this to a certain extent  by including a footnote indicating that the provision was struck down;
the continued use of the invalid provision reflects a ?signal failure?, that is, the failure of the executive, legislature and judiciary to respond to judicial development;
there was insufficient dissemination of the judgment through official channels by the executive; and
the supervisory role of the High Courts in ensuring awareness by lower Courts was ineffective in that it also failed to provide specific directions for the dissemination of the judgment.
For example, as noted by
Gupta and Sekhri
, the High Court Rules published by the High Court of Delhi failed to incorporate any provision for communicating decisions from the Supreme Court to the lower courts.
Under Articles 227 and 235 of the Constitution of India, High Courts are granted supervisory jurisdiction and administrative powers to maintain the efficient, smooth and orderly functioning of District Court and Tribunals, within its jurisdiction. These powers include
making and issuing general rules for regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; and
monitoring the day to day functioning of these courts.
These powers granted by Articles 227 and 235, entrust the High Courts with the duty to ensure effective communication of Supreme Court decisions to the subordinate courts within its jurisdiction, and also ensure compliance with such orders.
The battle against the 66A Zombies begins
In January, 2019, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (?PUCL?), one of the original petitioners in the
Shreya Singhal
Case, approached the Supreme Court highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court’s original decision.
In a
counter-affidavit,
the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on Section 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on Section 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded.
For instance,
Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional
and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019,
not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered
. The SC further directed that  the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.
The battle against the 66A Zombies continues
Despite this, fresh complaints continue to be filed, as recently
as April 2020
. In January 2020, the
Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act
. In February 2020,
a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged
, arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ?Sanatan dharma?.
In March 2020,
the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners
who had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.
We are committed to erasing S. 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. This blogpost on the journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court.
To meet this challenge we, in collaboration with
CivicDataLab
(?CDL?) with the support of
Tech4Dev
, have come up with a tool to track cases under S.66A through strong data collection, analysis, and visualization tools. We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system.

Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

ASHWINI team shares how
Avni
has become a major part of managing information of beneficiaries in their community health programme in Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu.
A community doctor
ASHWINI
(Association for Health Welfare of The Nilgiris) is a not-for-profit NGO which has been working since 1990 to improve the health indicators and health determinants of the 20,000 tribal population spread over 320 hamlets in Gudalur and Pandalur taluk of The Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. These tribes are among the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) identified by the Government of India and remain marginalized owing to their socio-economy and health. ASHWINI works through a three-tier health system; the 200 tribal health volunteers in the villages who form the first tier, the 17 tribal health animators in the eight health centres who form the second tier, the 50-bedded secondary care hospital – Gudalur Adivasi Hospital which forms the third tier. We run a community health programme (CHP) with the tribal health volunteers and health animators as the frontline workers. Through CHP we provide healthcare to the mother and child, sickle-cell patients, mental health patients, tuberculosis patients and patients suffering from Non-Communicable Diseases.
Field Animator with the tribals
The Journey so far..
In mid of 2017, we decided to switch from the 25-year-old, register-based system to a digital system to track cases and record data from our CHP. Avni, a mobile app-based system was selected for this transformation. Initially, we began with the mother and child programme, with components on ante-natal care, delivery care, post-natal care and growth monitoring of under-5 children. The transformation was met with much scepticism. The CHP workforce entirely consisted of tribals, mostly senior staff, who were not well-versed with technology.
However in 2020, 3 years after launching Avni and constant supervision by programme coordinators, we are happy to see our CHP team, collecting and collating patient information using this system with ease.
By the end of 2020, we digitized all the remaining programmes to Avni. Extra modules were added for the capture of death and family planning information as well. The tech team of ASHWINI was able to create the data collection and reporting formats of the new programmes using the newly released app designer of Avni and Metabase, the reporting solution used by Avni. This was a new experience for the technical team to design while capturing and reporting for field team in these new modules. As the program coordinators involved throughout the designing of the modules, it helped get valuable inputs on the data to be captured and the loophole in the data collection process in the field which could be considered while designing.
CHP Team after training on Avni
Here is how Avni has become a pillar of the community MIS in ASHWINI
1.
Instant access to information of beneficiaries of the community health programme
�
Immediate beneficiaries of the ASHWINI CHP programme are nearly 8000. The field workers are now assessing beneficiary information using their android device in the field and the program coordinators are monitoring progress using the web-based reporting system. Previously this information was stored in registers and was collated at the end of the month using monthly reports from each area. Avni has made this information instantly available and hence boosted the efficiency of our programme massively. Until three years back the data was captured in the field note of health animators and then it was transferred to respective program registers in Area centres. Manually monthly and yearly reports were prepared and these hardcopies were submitted to coordinators and which then fed in the computer. The data was extracted from the computers, cleaned and edited yearly basis. Now at the time of village visits itself, the data is captured directly into AVNI and reports are available at a central level instantaneously for viewing which is amazing!!!
2.
A cost-effective system with minimal errors
Avni provided us with an efficient community health management information system with minimal errors, minimal manual interventions and helps in effective supervision of the workforce by the coordinators. The previous reporting system being manual had inconsistencies with data entry and information unable to be used due to errors. Reporting through Avni helped us minimize such errors.
3.
Motivated field workers
With automation in place, constant training and supervision, the field workers adhere to regular reporting and have become proactive instead of reactive. As we have answers through the period rather than at the end, the field workers are motivated to regularly enter data. Also, health animators now feel how time-consuming manual collection of reports and writing in different registers and reporting forms were!!! To be able to look at the report instantaneously is in itself self-motivating. Now they are so happy to see the automatic report generation of their collected data.
4.
Individual monitoring of the progress of beneficiaries enrolled under various programmes
The in-built z-score calculator helps to monitor the growth progress of the under-5 children. Similarly, Avni helps in easy risk assessment of ante-natal women, post-natal women and other patients, using the captured lab results, scan reports, symptom assessment and regularity of medicines which are highlighted if abnormal in Avni.
5.
Effective use of gathered information leading to early interventions
The collected information is collated by the program coordinators for prompt decision making for the beneficiaries who may require immediate medical or social or nutritional intervention. Detailed analysis of captured data over a time period sheds light on the changes required in the programme design, to yield better outcomes.
6.
Research and analysis of information
The collected data is analysed and results published. The findings can be used for decision making in similar settings.
Next Step
As a next step, we have started work on integrating Avni, community MIS with Bahmni, hospital MIS to have a consolidated platform for beneficiary information collected in the community and hospital. This integration will strengthen our health management information system, thereby improving the coordination and dissemination of critical patient information between the hospital and the community.
We are proud of our 18 health animators in the field, who did a great effort and willingness to learn the new aspects and technology, which is new and difficult for them. We are thankful to tech4dev for supporting us in this project.
Avni was a major milestone and a leap for ASHWINI. It paved a new era of digital transformation which made our work efficient and helped us understand anything is possible if we keep trying.
The success of Avni in ASHWINI shows that automation is possible in similar settings and NGOs and will provide efficiency in the data management system.

==================================================

Three months ago, Radhika gave me a book on people management —
Radical Candor
. I’ll be honest — I judged the book by its title. I assumed it would be full of dense theories that would go over my head. But to my surprise, it’s packed with powerful and practical concepts. The core idea of “Radical Candor” intrigued me so much that I’ve been talking about it with anyone who’ll listen.
Little did I know that I would witness Radical Candor in action — up close and personal — in the most unexpected place and from the most unexpected person: during a recent community visit with SNEHA NGO in Mumbai, through a community organizer (CO), a frontline health worker. That experience truly showed me how impactful Radical Candor can be, reinforcing its importance.
But before I dive into what Radical Candor is (for those unfamiliar with the concept), let me first share a bit about the field visit that led to this reflection & many others.
For the last seven months, I’ve been working as a Fractional Product Manager with
SNEHA
, a Mumbai-based non-profit organization focused on improving the health and well-being of women, children, and families in urban informal settlements. I’ve been supporting their team with capacity building, implementation, and planning for a Chatbot pilot in two areas to improve information-seeking behavior related to maternal and child health.
As part of launching the Chatbot pilot, I visited the Malwani and Bhiwandi SNEHA offices to induct their community organizers (COs) — explaining the what, why, and how of the pilot so they could onboard women (users) onto the Chatbot. Since the Malwani CO induction was scheduled for the second half of the second day, I decided to tag along with a CO in the first half to see them in action and to better understand the community where we would be implementing the Chatbot.
When I finally reached the Malwani SNEHA office (after many directions from Dishankita), I was a little surprised by what I saw. It was a humble setup tucked into a narrow lane of the community. I’ve visited quite a few NGO offices before, but had never seen a medium to big sized NGO office located
within
the community itself. Later, when I spoke with Shreya ma’am (their Associate Program Director), she explained that they chose this location because they didn’t want to miss anything happening on the ground (Sometimes, even the community domestic disputes & resolution take place in their office) — it helps them stay updated. I was deeply impressed and inspired by the team’s dedication.
After waiting there for a while, I was introduced to Shahidunissa madam, a CO who has been working in the community for the past five years. She is responsible for around 400 households, where she engages with families on a range of topics such as menstrual health, family planning, maternal health, childcare during the first 1,000 days, domestic violence, and more.
As I started walking with her through the community, going from one house to another, she was greeted by almost every second person. She exchanged casual conversations — checking on their health, asking if they followed the advice she’d given previously, or why the child hadn’t gone to school that day. In just that short span of time, I could sense the deep bond she had formed with the community — the kind that makes families see her as one of their own. When I shared this observation with her, she responded with a big, happy smile and said,
“Haan madam, main agar do din bhi nahi aati hoon, toh mujhe call aajata hai — poochhte hain kya ho gaya didi, tabiyat toh theek hai?”
I accompanied her to around five or six houses as she went about her routine work—doing anthropometry checks for ANC cases and other monthly follow-ups. I mostly observed in silence, watching how she engaged with each household.
In just those few hours, I was exposed to a wide range of issues some of which I have never seen/ heard first hand—stories of domestic violence, tobacco addiction, a two-year-old child hospitalized due to underdevelopment, unemployment, water problems and young pregnancies.
But it would be unfair to only highlight one side of the story. I also heard powerful stories of resilience, hope, and care—a single mother doing everything she can to ensure her son gets a good education; a kind-hearted woman caring for her neighbor’s sick child;
Sanginis
who step in and report violence when they witness it in the community; and volunteer who has offered their homes to serve as condom depots—something that’s far from easy in such a close-knit and conservative community.
As I returned to the office, my mind was full of everything I had seen and heard. While I had a few personal reflections—on privilege, equity, and the ripple effects of systemic issues (thoughts for another day)—this field visit strongly reinforced the importance of truly understanding the nuances of ground realities: people’s needs, wants, fears, limitations, aspirations, and beliefs, before we even begin to think about solving their problems.
It’s easy—and even satisfying—to design quick solutions from a distance, assuming things work the same way everywhere. But how terribly wrong I would have been if I had assumed that early morning messages would work (P.S. – we weren’t doing this), just because people elsewhere start their day early. I would have completely missed the fact that, in this community, many women wake up at 10 or 11 a.m. because they get water only between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., and end up sleeping late after finishing household chores. That’s something I wouldn’t have known unless I had visited or asked the team—because it’s not how things work where I live.
This visit also reminded me of the importance of staying consistently connected with program teams—asking questions, listening to their feedback and understanding their perspectives—because they know the community best.
Most importantly, it underscored the responsibility we carry while building the chatbot for them (especially the AI-generated responses), since it’s being positioned as the digital version of a CO—a “SNEHA didi.” We have to make sure that the trust people have in their didis is not compromised.
This field visit, in many ways, reminded me that it’s not enough to be a good Product Manager—I need to be a responsible one.
And now, coming back to where I started—
Radical Candor
.
For those who may not be familiar with the concept, Radical Candor is the ability to challenge directly while simultaneously showing that you care personally—without being aggressive or insincere. Simply put, it’s about giving honest and direct feedback, while maintaining empathy for the person on the receiving end. You can read more about the concept
here
to get a quick understanding.
In almost every interaction CO Madam had with the women, I saw Radical Candor in action. She genuinely cares for the people she engages with—understanding their challenges, limitations, aspirations, and beliefs. While empathizing deeply with them, she doesn’t hesitate to give feedback that could help them improve their lives.
Let me explain with a couple of examples-
In her conversation with a woman who had continued fasting during Ramadan despite being pregnant (and many of them are usually high-risk cases), she gently but directly told her that she shouldn’t have done it, especially considering the well-being of her unborn child—and that even God would have understood, given her condition. She then immediately shifted the mood, saying, “What’s done is done,” and encouraged her to start eating healthy going forward. She explained the importance of a nutritious diet, pointed out the key nutrients missing from her current meals, and even enquired about her other children’s vaccinations and studies.
In another instance, during a light-hearted chat with an older, fun-loving woman who was addicted to tobacco, she joked, “Don’t you want to see your grandchildren?” and “I would tell your husband not to give you any more money”—but then shifted gears to speak seriously, reminding about the risks of tobacco addiction. She recommended visiting a de-addiction center and even offered to explore alternative options like medication, since the woman wasn’t keen on going to rehab.
In both cases, I saw the women listening to the COs with genuine attention and sincerity. And in that moment, it struck me—
this
is exactly what Radical Candor looks like. Shahidunissa Madam cared personally for the women while also offering direct, constructive feedback.
If she had simply told the pregnant woman that her belief was wrong and she shouldn’t have fasted, it might have come across as
Obnoxious Aggression
. On the other hand, if she had avoided discouraging fasting out of respect for the woman’s beliefs, that too wouldn’t have helped either—
Ruinous Empathy
or even
Manipulative Insincerity
.
Because she struck the right balance between
caring personally
and
challenging directly
, the women were not just listening—they were open, receptive, and possibly even ready to change.
If you’re wondering whether this kind of approach leads to long-term change—oh, absolutely! After SNEHA’s intervention, the percentage of families practicing family planning in the Malwani community jumped from 27% to around 65%. I’m sure countless radically candid conversations like these happen every single day, often without even being consciously labeled as such.
My respect for the SNEHA organization and their team has only deepened. I walked away from that visit feeling more inspired and more responsible—than when I arrived.Title: How the Data Catalyst Program Helped Improve Our Data Pipeline

==================================================

Written By:- Heena, Avanti Fellows
Our journey with the Data Catalyst Program (DCP) began in July, when we set out to improve our data pipelines. We knew there were gaps in our systems, but we needed something to push us into action. The DCP was just what we needed to turn our ideas into reality.
A Step Into Data Maturity
I first came across the idea of data maturity while working with NITI Aayog, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MoDWS), and the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) on programs like Swachh Bharat Mission and Poshan Abhiyaan. Although the concept was introduced in 2022 as
DGQI
, it took some time for it to gain momentum. Last year, it was a challenge to get others on board with the idea, but the DCP gave me a chance to dive deeper into the topic and start meaningful conversations about it within the organization.
Working with Our Mentor
One of the most valuable parts of the program was the mentorship we received. Our mentor,
Siddhant
, helped us understand our data architecture and identify areas that needed improvement. With his guidance, we’ve made several key improvements:
Reducing BigQuery Costs by 40%
: By setting up precomputed tables on BigQuery for dashboards.
Adding Version Control to SQL Queries
: This helps us keep track of changes and ensures our data processes are accountable
Setting Up Alerts
: We now get daily alerts on Discord about BigQuery usage and costs, helping us stay on top of things.
Building a Stronger Infrastructure
: We set up a new data infrastructure using tools like Airbyte, dbt, and Prefect.
Ongoing Transition
: We’re working on moving all our scheduled queries and ETL scripts to the new setup.
Data Governance: A Crucial Learning
One of the most eye-opening sessions of the program was
Unlocking Data Access
by Ashwini Lotlikar. As a non-profit, we work with sensitive data of beneficiaries—like students, parents, and teachers—and we have a responsibility to handle that data carefully. The Data Governance Worksheets helped us reflect on how we collect, store, and share data, and it reinforced us to think about our ethical and legal obligations when managing sensitive information.
Through the workshop, we learned important concepts related to data protection:
Data Fiduciary
: We act as the data fiduciaries, meaning we decide how personal data is processed and must protect it.
Data Principal
: These are the people whose data we collect—often students or children, who need extra protection.
Data Processor
: These are the third parties we work with to analyze data or manage databases. We must ensure they follow privacy standards.
Consent Manager
: For vulnerable groups, it’s essential to manage consent properly, ensuring people can control how their data is used.
Key Takeaways from the DCP Program
The DCP program was a turning point for me to align my understanding with data maturity. Here are a few key lessons I’ve learned:
Use Common Terms
: Everyone in the organization should speak the same “data language” to work together effectively.
Focus on the Frontline
: Real change happens when those who directly serve beneficiaries are involved in the process, not just technology.
Balance Top-Down and Bottom-Up
: Programs should be planned centrally but also take feedback from those on the ground to make sure they’re practical.
Regular progress checks
: Holding regular meetings with teams helps keep everyone accountable and allows us to adjust as needed.
Separate Budgets for Data
: It’s important to have specific budgets for technology and data in every program.
Perfect Data is a Myth
: You won’t always have perfect data. The key is to make the most of what you have and make decisions based on it.
Looking Ahead
The DCP has been a game-changer for us. It’s not just about improving our data systems, but also about understanding the importance of handling data responsibly. As we continue to improve our data pipelines and systems, we’re committed to transparency, trust, and ethical data practices.
Data is more than just numbers—it represents real people and stories. Whether we’re using data to improve learning outcomes or fine-tuning our programs, we always prioritize the rights and dignity of the people behind the data.
By participating in the DCP program, we’ve gained valuable knowledge. This journey has been one of learning, growth, and, most importantly, action.Title: How we used Metabase with Avni to analyze data

==================================================

Reporting needs at Setco
During our initial requirement gathering phase, Setco team had shared with us a list of reports they would need for each module we implement using Avni. The list shared with us was pretty exhaustive and the idea was to get an aggregate summary of major data points captured right from user registrations, to enrollment in various programs to the periodic visits that happen during that program.
Per this list, every module had 12-15 such data points that needed to be tracked. These were the same points that Setco had been using in the past to monitor the impact of their programs at various locations in Kalol district of Gujarat. Towards the end of every financial year, based on the analysis of these points, they decide on improvements needed for the program.
Choosing reporting tool for Setcos implementation
Since the list of reports to be implemented for Setco was ready, the next step was to identify the tool for reporting. Avni is flexible enough to be able to handshake with any reporting tool.
During the early days of Avni, the team had used Metabase extensively for all its reporting needs. But, over a period of time, as data volumes increased, the team faced certain hurdles especially with complex long-running queries in Metabase (
heres a nice blog from Avni explaining these details
). This was when Avni team suggested that we should judiciously decide on the reporting tool based on our reporting needs
As mentioned earlier in Setcos context, the reports revolved around an aggregate summary of major data points. So, for us, Metabase came as the natural choice – as the queries were not very complex.
The second driving factor for using Metabase was – in order to use any other reporting tool, we would need access to Setcos transactional data stored in the Avni database. With Avni being multi-tenant by design, sharing organization-based data with us (the implementers) was something that was unprecedented and needed additional engineering efforts by the Avni team.
So, to be able to stick to our time estimates and also considering that our queries were not that complex, we decided to choose Metabase as a reporting tool for Setcos needs.
Metabase Reports
Once the choice of reporting tool was made, the next step was to see if we could templatize these report queries. This we thought was an important step, as all the data points tracked in the report, were to be analyzed on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis.
Templatizing Queries
So, logically speaking the queries had to be the same, what would really differ is the period on which they were grouped.
Typically, when we start translating the requierments into SQL queries for a requirement like ours (in case of Setco), queries differ from each other only on the period range on which the records are grouped and many a times developers end up writing 3 different queries for monthly, quarterly and yearly analysis of the same data point. This is where we thought of coming up with a query template, where we could use a single query, to pivot the results around any period monthly, quarterly or yearly.
Above is the query template that we used, to do these period wise analyses. Further, the part highlighted in red is a reusable query that can be used in every report that is aggregated on time period. So the SQL snippets feature of Metabase was helpful here – where we moved the red highlighted part as SQL snippet in Metabase.
Dashboard
With every module having 12-15 reports under it, the next step was to make a decision on how we display all these reports so that the end-users do not have to search for a specific report – and get the entire picture of any of their programs at one single place. Metabase dashboards came in handy here. Metabase dashboard lets you pull charts as well as data in tabular format on its dashboard, and arrange them, the way you like.
To start with we thought, we could have one dashboard for each module. Each dashboard in turn could have one graph for every key indicator of the program that needs to be monitored. At one glance, this would give a quick analysis of the program at all the places where it was implemented (Setco implements all its programs at 18 different locations in Kalol). The dashboard therefore would be a good indicator to quickly highlight how good or bad a program implementation was, at any particular location as compared to the other. Heres a sample dashboard for their ANC (Antenatal care) program.
Further, applying filters on the dashboard helps analyze data on different timelines. The screenshots below show one report for different periods. Notice how just changing �Period Type� parameter of the dashboard filter changes the report data grouping.
Year wise report
Quarter wise report
Month wise report
Drilling down data from dashboard reports
The enterprise edition of the dashboard does provide a way to click on say a bar in the bar graph and link it to another report which can show the exploded details (Read more
here
). However, this kind of linkage from a bar graph or a column in a data-table is not possible in the free/open-source edition. So, as seen in the above screenshots, a column called View details was added to each data table, to help users drill down to the details
As of now, all these decisions have turned out to be helpful in making progress with the reports. Recently, Avni also released a new feature that lets implementers automatically generate views for each of the forms they design in Avni. This feature will help implementers like us write reporting queries without having to understand the complex Avni schema. We are still doing back and forth with the team, to make use of this brand-new feature to the fullest.
Stay tuned for more updates about it in our next blog.Title: I. TechTonic Shift: Google-Tech4Good Summit 19

==================================================

We at #Tech4Good, set out to build a community of people who?d work together to transform the nonprofit landscape. The tech revolution that had whizzed past, merely scratching the surface of civil society movements, is now actively being redirected towards social change by players of all stripes: activists, techies, non-techies working with tech, people with 9 to 5 jobs stretching the constraints of time and space to volunteer with nonprofits remotely.
The Google-Tech4Good Partnership was borne out of this churn;
several such individuals came together to prove that change is the only constant, and that that is a very good thing. Nothing today, stands in the way of civil society movements in India, tapping into this tech hive-mind. The Google-Tech4Good Summit is a marriage of these technocratic inclinations & civil rights predispositions.
Google, as part of their Geo for good initiative, lent their time, expertise and support to 4 Tech4Good partner organizations-
Jagrutha Mahila Sangathan
,
Mahila Housing Sewa Trust,
The Nudge Foundation
&
Vidhya Vidhai
, who will be sharing their experiences with the Tech4Good-Google Mentorship Programme, at the Summit. The mentors in turn, will conduct a hands on session for 60 other participating nonprofits on 4 different Google tools, for them to adapt and contextualise them in a way that is relevant to them.
Call it a hackathon, a conference, a congress of people willing to shake themselves out of the steady routine they’ve come to call their sector, their monkeysphere, their comfort zone. We call it a disruption hell bent on reimagining the civil society architecture: a Techtonic Shift.
A Case Study
Mahila Housing Sewa Trust (MHT) was founded in 1994 by the Self Employed Women?s Association (SEWA), a union of self employed women workers, in order to facilitate better housing and infrastructure for its members in the state of Gujarat.
MHT serves as a link between the government, service providers & communities. They realised that the true challenge lay in identifying vulnerable areas that needed upliftment, that the slum development activities suffered due to the lack of proper imaging and mapping, and community members had a hard time locating services & resources (Health, Education facilities) in nearby areas.
They cracked a tool that could help communicate with stakeholders visually: help expedite project timelines, make issues that seem unrelatable and impervious to any real solutions, familiar and tangible through accurate imaging: MHT was introduced to My Maps through Tech4Good and Google Earth Outreach.
They are now using My Maps to share project impact with donors to visually highlight geographical
expansion and overall impact of the project. They have also been using the tool for accurate project planning: The members of Ahmedabad?s Sarkhej ward, home to 126 households, don?t have access to municipal water connection and overspend on pure drinking water. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation misinformed this community, that the existing source of water was outside the municipal borders. MHT identified existing water connection points with the help of community members and developed a plan to create a water connection network using My maps, they conducted a meeting with the Corporator and community members to work towards an implementable solution. This was done by plotting existing water connection points on My Maps. The Corporator, with inputs from the community members, has finally created a plan to make water connection accessible to the community.
MHT will be presenting the details of how they achieved these wins and more, at the Google-Tech4Good Summit ?19. We will also be in talks with 4 professional panelists with expertise ranging from building civil society movements to giant tech companies and are looking forward to a keynote address by
Narasamma
, the leader of our long standing partner organization, Jagrutha Mahila Sangathan.Title: II. Techtonic Shift: Google-Tech4Good Summit ’19

Narasamma with the four panelists
The
Google-Tech4Good Summit’19
turned out to be exactly how we’d conceived of it: a coming together of a set of ecosystems, the synergistic impact of which was felt in its entirety towards the very end, when what was to be a 15 min. keynote address by
Narasamma
(Leader, Jagrutha Mahila Sanghatane) organically transformed into an hour long exploration of the life of the firebrand leader & her tryst with technology.
Hands on session by one of the Google Mentors
Tech4Good would like to extend its heartfelt gratitude: to
Google
, for their energy & support, for providing us with a venue to host this event & most of all, for giving us their time in the form of 4 brilliant mentors & their incredibly sincere approach towards their assigned organisations;
To our 4 partner Nonprofits, for being part of the Tech4Good-Google Mentorship programme and really making it their own with the time & effort they put into contextualising the tools and coming forward to share their insights with all present;
The 4 Panelists: Anand Devsharma, Gaurav Gupta, Murugan Vasudevan & Sudha Srinivasan (L-R)

Hands on Session
To all 58 participating nonprofits for taking out the time to be a part of this Summit & for being our sounding boards, with their candid inquiries & sustained energy throughout the day as they tinkered with the tools i.e.
Open Data Kit,
Google Earth Edu
,
Google Ads
&
My Maps
.
Ram from Vidhya Vidhai presenting his work with Google Earth
The first time presenters from different parts of India, represented a diverse set of challenges & made use of these Google Tools to make a purposeful dent:
Shruti from
Jagrutha Mahila Sanghatne
(Open Data Kit)
Ram & Regila from
Vidhya Vidhai
(Google Earth Edu)
Namratha from
The Nudge Foundation
(Google Ads)
Bhumika from
Mahila Housing Sewa Trust
(My Maps)
This nonprofit to nonprofit connect was probably the Summit’s biggest success: participants approached our partner nonprofits to get a deeper look into their personal journeys using the tools, paving the way for us to ideate on future buildathons & a more collaborative understanding on the way forward.
The idea of this Summit of course, was not to go back fully trained but to get a sense of what these tools could do for all present. All of us are at a crucial point in the journey of amplifying our social impact and we all live from prototypes to pilots to scalable models. Any of these phases is incredible to be in, simply because we represent an agile bunch of people trying to solve for India’s toughest developmental challenges and that persistence is what this Summit was a celebration of.
Keynote speech by Narasamma
We could not have asked for a better ambassador: Narasamma’s life bears testament to this indomitable human spirit of persistence & perseverance, her words regardless of the language they were spoken in (translated from Kannada to English), garnered resounding applause each time she shared an anecdote from her life- the violence she & all the women in Pothnal, Raichur endured owing to their Dalit identity, her struggle to transform the social landscape in her area by reclaiming the status of her people one government scheme at a time- but most of all, when she shared her stories of hope- how the women in her organisation were overcoming these barriers to justice by educating themselves on the issues ailing them & by embracing the utilitarian power of technology, which has proved to be an equaliser in a village still caught in the malaise of caste & gender discrimination.
We hope to take our learnings from this Summit to ideate further on its scope & to regularise this process of shaking people out of their steady routines to partake in something that truly connects us all: the activists, the techies, non-techies & ‘those with 9 to 5 jobs’- who indeed stretched the constraints of time and space, to volunteer with nonprofits remotely but also came together under one roof to make this marriage of apparently different worlds, a reality.Title: Ideas from diverse lenses: Facilitating an ideation workshop for OpenCity

�Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when its the only one we have .
mile Chartier
Just like in many areas of life, this famous quote by French philosopher
mile Chartier
holds a lot of truth when it comes to the design and development of technology. While ideas are the life-breath of any innovative work that we do, its important to consider a number of ideas coming from diverse perspectives to widen our perspective and reach more holistic solutions.
We tried embarking on such an exploration in
OpenCity
redesign project that we are doing. OpenCity is a city-level data repository hosted and developed by
Oorvani Foundation
and
Data Meet.
After gaining many insights about the users in the
research
, we moved towards ideation. Ideation is a crucial part of the design thinking process and we attempted to follow a more participatory approach to this phase. For this, we conducted an ideation workshop with participants who fall under the
user buckets
that we had identified earlier during research.
How are ideation sessions with stakeholders/users beneficial in the design process?
An ideation workshop is a dedicated session for creative thought facilitated for different stakeholders or a diverse set of users. Ideation sessions are conducted after a considerable amount of design research (Empathise phase in design thinking process) is done and when the team has identified key questions for the project that needs ideas on.
Steps in the design thinking process
A brief (or questions) is given to the participants of the sessions as pointers for ideation and they are encouraged to engage in free creative thought using various ideation techniques.
The aim here is to refrain from thinking about the quality of the ideas and focusing on generating a large number of ideas that can later be analyzed and narrowed down. Thus the team gets a whole bunch of fresh perspectives to proceed within the project rather than following a constraint path. An added advantage is that these ideas are coming from a diverse set of users or stakeholders; having these ideas from the people who face the problems that we are trying to solve always fosters human-centeredness.
It is also highly possible that some of the ideas generated by participants in these sessions could have great value. While some ideas may seem impossible from a practical point of view, they might potentially help pave stepping stones on the future scope of the project.
How did we conduct the ideation workshop?
Towards the end of the design research, we got many insights which needed explorations for solutions. We framed these insights into pointers for ideation as
How might we
questions, an ideation technique that lets us frame a problem into a brief for which ideas can be thought of.
Some of the How-might -we question that we generated
For example, one of the insights that we gained in the research was that for users, knowing that the data is reliable and authentic is a prime need.
We framed this insight into a pointer for ideation as:
How might we help the users be ensured about the reliability of data hosted on OpenCity?
To get ideas from different points of view, we further mapped these questions into themes like:
Community engagement
Data and its accessibility
Values of OpenCity
Information dissemination
Visual representation of data and aesthetics
Sustainability
Ideas VS The pandemic!
The picture that usually comes to our mind when we say ideation workshop is pretty colorful; filled with sticky notes, markers of varied colors, chart papers, and scissors! But unfortunately, we had to work with a lot of constraints because of the pandemic. The session had to be conducted online and that meant none of the things mentioned above could be used!

Compared to in-person sessions, its slightly more challenging to facilitate an ideation workshop online and its trickier to ensure that the participants are comfortable and having a good time and are not feeling lost in any way. But sticking to basics helped us to overcome that challenge.
Although while planning the workshop, we explored various online tools that allowed facilitating workshops, after a lot of thought we decided to simply make use of Google Docs, mainly because the participants would be already familiar and much more comfortable using docs than any other tool. Using a tool that was really familiar for the participants was really important; it helped prevent any confusion using a new tool, which definitely would have been a blocker in free-flowing creative thought.
Screenshots of some of the ideas participants jotted down during the session
The participants we had for the workshop were members of
Oorvani Foundation
and
CivicDataLab
, and they were from diverse expertise fitting our user buckets. Before the session began, we divided the participants whom we had invited into four groups and assigned a member from our team to facilitate the ideation session for each group.
All the participants and our team met on a Google Meet call and after a short ice-breaking session and a briefing about the session, we dispersed into 4 groups. Each group was given a set of How-might we questions from different themes to generate ideas on. The facilitators for each group asked the participants to jot down as many ideas as possible for each question within a set time. We encouraged the participants to be non-judgemental of the ideas that come to their mind and let go of constraints like practicality. In each group, participants created a lot of fascinating ideas for each question. When the time for ideating was up, all of us gathered together again and had a fun discussion before parting.
After the session: Mapping and analysis of the ideas
An important task that followed after the ideation session for the design team was to collate all the ideas and analyze them. If the ideation workshop needed us to wear a creative hat and not be constrained in thought, the mindset needed for the analysis was the complete opposite.
Now, the team had to look at each idea generated in the session with more of an analytical lens, trying to understand the particular perspective the idea came from, what the participant was trying to suggest to us through an idea, and of course the practicality of the idea.
To make this process easier we mapped all the ideas to the earlier themes and together as a team we discussed the possibilities presented in each idea. We marked all the ideas which could fit into the current scope of the project and we mapped the ones which could be interesting to look at in the future scope of the project. A lot of the ideas hold potentially interesting directions and we can revisit them for the future phases of the project.
Mapping and analysis of the ideas received in the session
Looking back
Fast forward some time, we can say these ideas generated by the participants have greatly shaped the design and the outcomes that we are looking at in the project right now. Doing an ideation workshop for OpenCity has helped in shaping the project in a much better way than we would have otherwise. It has helped us look beyond our narrow perspectives and see things from multiple angles before building the final end product. Above all, generating a lot of ideas with the participants who are coming from different expertise and perspectives has helped us to look at things much more holistically.

Author: Ashwin Srinivasan

==================================================

“Data is the new oil.” – Clive Humby
“Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.” – Peter Sondergaard
We’ve all heard quotes like these. This sentiment has been supercharged in the last 2 years due to the advances in AI, with data being the bedrock of much of AI’s promise. NGOs have also been hearing this repeatedly, from the ecosystem … and often from their funders.
So Dalgo, project Tech4Dev’s data platform for the non-profit sector is ideally placed to help NGOs in this regard.
The problems are clearly articulated, and the value proposition seems obvious. The Dalgo team has built a solid data product, enabling automated pipelines,  powerful dashboarding capabilities, and consulting and support from people who understand non-profits and their needs. And all of this, at a price point affordable to most NGOs.
For the past two years, we’ve been neck-deep in building infrastructure and supporting customers as they get used to running a data platform. We’ve grown to serve over 20 customers, saved our users countless hours in spreadsheet wrangling, and provided tailored support and assistance to our customers. Moreover, we’ve had low churn and are hearing very positive feedback from most of our users.
So, what next? Logically, now that we have product-market fit, we should look to scale. Sharpen our product analytics, refine our marketing, sell more assertively, and proactively adopt the latest and greatest data and AI advances to supercharge our product and its distribution.
But actually, when we started doing this, it didn’t feel right.
Instead, it led us to some uncomfortable questions.
Why does our product exist? Can we convincingly tell NGOs that we’re offering them something unique, that will help them in a way that other products will not? Or are we just adding to the noise and trying to perpetuate our own existence? Or scaling for our own benefit?
Earlier this year, at our sprint in Mahabalipuram, with customers like SNEHA, Antarang, INREM, Arghyam, Janagraha, we set aside the language of tech and turned to the language of need.
What actually helps these teams? What do their days look like? How has Dalgo helped them? What does a “useful” insight mean when you’re running a large-scale intervention or reporting to a donor on short timelines?
It’s easier to make products and services for the customers you seek to serve than it is to find customers for your products and services. – Seth Godin
What started in Mahabalipuram, has continued through regular sessions with many of our customers. We get feedback on ideas, jointly iterate on prototypes, and try to learn more about the nuances of their challenges with data. These engagements are sometimes long-winded, circuitous and often reach dead ends or rabbit holes … but we’re ok with this. We don’t know our destination, so we must be prepared to wander and wonder.
From Tables to Transformation: What We Are Learning
We hope we have got better at listening, and what we have heard has shaped how we see Dalgo’s next evolution. Here are 7 things that have stood out:
“Chat with your data” is intriguing, but not urgent
Our users
want reliability and simplicity more than novelty. LLMs can help — but only if grounded in specific tasks and clean data. At the start of the year, we were very excited about chat and other AI-centric features, and wanted to commit much of our roadmap towards this end. Our customers have pushed us towards a more balanced perspective – chat with your data and other such features could be valuable, but there are more fundamental things to work on ahead of this.
Dalgo still speaks to a technical audience
Our interface, structure, and terminology still feel built for data scientists and engineers. That’s not who we serve. We’re rethinking our information architecture to appeal to NGO leaders, field staff, program teams, and M&E officers.
Guidance is gold
NGOs need to be nudged toward value. What metric should they look at today? What’s changed this week? Passive dashboards aren’t enough. This is specifically relevant when NGOs are onboarding onto the platform.
Quant must embrace qual
When narrative and numbers intersect — a quote alongside a trendline — teams feel informed, not just presented to. This overlay of storytelling and stats is where we can create differentiated value. This is something that we are still unpacking, but we know that it’s very important because almost every NGO is interested in this.
Maps matter
Geographic insights resonate powerfully. Program teams light up when they see patterns emerge on a map. Better maps are one of the most demanded features, and we’re investing in it.
Messy data is the norm
And it’s okay. Instead of expecting clean inputs, we’re focusing on helping NGOs assess
how reliable
their data is, and how to improve it incrementally.
Reporting is not a by-product — for many, it is the product
The end goal for many teams isn’t the dashboard. It’s the deck, the digest, the PDF, the donor update. Dalgo must embrace reporting and storytelling as core workflows, not afterthoughts.
Dalgo should not just be a tool for building data pipelines, but should be a partner in storytelling, decision making, and should make data accessible to everyone as they go about their daily work. The
everyone
is important here, because Dalgo should help people from all roles work more effectively by using data – and should not just be a power tool for M&E and Data teams. We have long articulated how Dalgo can help a variety of people within NGOs, but we have more work to do to make this a reality.
Staying Grounded
It’s easy to get swept up in the metrics of product-building — activation, qualified leads, sales funnels, monthly active users, churn, retention, roadmap velocity. But those aren’t the metrics that matter most to the NGOs we serve. Dalgo was never meant to be about the data alone. It’s meant to be about the change that data empowerment enables.
We thank all the NGOs who have been generous with their time and their insights over the last several months. Thank you for giving us a window into your world, and helping us to hopefully serve you better.
As we move forward, we’re holding onto a few reminders:
“Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a voice.” –
Stephen Few
“Data will talk to you if you’re willing to listen.” –
Jim Bergeson
“NGOs will talk to you if you’re willing to listen.” –
Dalgo Team
We’re listening. And we’re just getting started.Title: Improving Sanitation in India: SHRI’s Tech-Driven Approach with Dalgo

==================================================

Written by: Anoop, SHRI
Eliminating open defecation has long been one of Indias greatest development challenges. A number of government-led programs, dating back to the 1980s, have tried to solve this enormous issue. In 2014, the government launched the most ambitious program to date. Called Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), this program aimed at ending open defecation through the provision of financial subsidies to households to promote toilet construction. Millions of household toilets have been built since, dramatically reducing the overall burden of open defecation throughout the country.
Nevertheless, as of 2021, approximately 24 crore people throughout India were defecating in the open. A large reason for this is that household toilets remain infeasible for many of Indias poorest citizens. Land constraints, credit constraints, and inadequate sewer connectivity prevent households from building a toilet.
As a response, the government has invested heavily in building community toilets that can be used by those who are unable to own a household toilet. The government has built over six lakh community facilities since 2014. Unfortunately, the government has not provided any guidance for how these facilities are to be maintained. They quickly become dirty and are rendered useless, forcing people to revert to open defecation.
Sanitation and Health Rights in India (SHRI) installs a professionalized operating and maintenance (O&M) system at government-built facilities to help improve facility quality, an important predictor of use. SHRI has developed an online dashboard that displays key quality and use metrics to demonstrate the impact of its system. Overall, 6,000 people, who otherwise would be defecating in the open, use SHRIs 14 facilities daily for free.
SHRIs partnership with Dalgo has been critical to the development of an automated system to display daily facility quality and use data. Before this partnership, SHRIs quality and use data had to be manually manipulated and pushed to the dashboard on a daily basis. SHRIs partnership with Dalgo has allowed for us to automate this process. Now, the data on quality and use indicators that are collected daily are processed by the system that Dalgo co-created with SHRI and uploaded automatically at the same time every day. This is critical for several reasons. First, it ensures that SHRIs staff gain timely insights into facility performance. They can make adjustments accordingly and can do so quickly as the data are being reported at the same time every day. Consistent access to facility-level data empowers facility staff and managers to observe patterns and identify and resolve issues. Second, this consistency builds trusts with outside partners, who can track facility performance without having to wait for someone to push the information. Third, having an automated system is imperative as SHRI is about to scale its system to over 50 new facilities in Jharkhand.
We started SHRI because we believe that every person in India has the right to safe and hygienic sanitation. While this is not a technological problem, we firmly believe that technology, when used well, can help us achieve this goal. Our collaboration with Dalgo is a testament to that ideal.Title: In conversation with Digital Green | GlificTalks#1

==================================================

On their mission to empower farmer groups,
Digital Green
has been relentless in finding the best methods, tools and technology. In our previous conversation(coming soon) with Digital Green(DG), Glific team learned about the various communication programs run by them to impact the farmers. Some of these included running pilot cases to test WhatsApp(WA) groups, IVR systems and some web apps to engage, educate and empower their audience. Having collected a lot of experience with using WA for their communication requirements, we crossed paths to explore how Glific can help in their endeavour.
Our exploration of communication requirements at DG started by understanding the opportunities and gaps of using a WA-based solution (FAQs coming soon). A high level view makes it evident that DG cannot leverage �groups� structure anymore for communicating, as a part of WA for business. However, they can carry out 1-2-1 conversations. To continue the conversation with the beneficiaries, DG would have to message within a 24 hour window, outside which only a template message can be sent. On the downside, all template messages need to be approved by WA.
This provided a frame in which to think about building strong communication channels for their various programs. We discovered that Glific�s two-way communication can help them in setting a channel with the beneficiary group where there�s a large scale broadcast of message/content and there�s a possibility to receive responses. Receiving responses from the beneficiary doesn�t essentially need to be an immediate step but with a few rounds of messages, beneficiaries can feel more engaged and can start responding or asking questions. In other words, Glific can help DG with their one-way content dissemination with a possibility to make it a two-way communication.
We also discovered that within DG the communication requirements may vary as per the different programmes and initiatives. Some could be educational and some could be based around a service model. We concluded this rich exploratory conversation, with two fundamental discoveries:
Identification of the use case where Glific�s communication platform can help
Running pilots to validate if the potential use cases can be well-supported by Glific.Title: India Summer Trip Report – Reflections & Thoughts – July 2022

==================================================

Another blog post from the air as I make my way back to San Francisco from Mumbai. As with all my recent trips, Im super exhausted and looking forward to recovering and recharging at home. It was great to be in India during the monsoon season, and it was indeed a spectacular monsoon. I think the lasting image of the
GarudMaachi
sprint would be the constant rain for pretty much the entire time (even though I missed most of it).
I did manage to get Covid on this trip. Belief in science is a good thing ???? Thanks to the vaccine and two booster shots the effect was relatively mild. It did give me an opportunity to spend a lot of time at home in quarantine, being pampered by my mom. Managed to get a fair amount of stuff taken care of during this period. Mari and Pranjali had also come to India this summer and spent part of their vacation hanging out with the young women at
Sharanam Center
and did some technology classes with the adolescents in
Sneha Mumbai
. It was good to listen to their experiences of the day and their adventures around Mumbai.
The Tech4Dev group, Pratima from Shelter and the Suvita group
Some random thoughts and comments from the few weeks I was there
Everyone should experience an Indian monsoon at least once 🙂 It was quite amazing to see so such torrential rain over an extended period of time.
Met a few funders on this trip. We seem to have made a good enough name for ourselves, that getting a meeting has become slightly easier. Most of the funders also resonate strongly with one or more of the initiatives.
In-person meetings are so much better and so much more productive than online meetings. The group got a lot done with the Glific NGOs in the 4 days they spent together.
We still need to figure out the right balance between being remote and away for an extended period. We know we get a lot done when we eliminate distractions and travel. Getting people to commit for an entire week (or 4 days) is a challenge, but having folks leave in between disrupts the rhythm. From the next sprint onwards, it will be an all-or-nothing deal for everyone, no exceptions.
We also need to figure out how to reduce last minute cancellations. Most likely we will charge everyone a small amount which might help with decreasing the number of cancellations. Logistics is time consuming and following up with folks is never-ending. We will out-source this for the next sprint.
While both NGOs and funders are seeing the benefits of being open, there is still a lot that remains to be done. Its kinda hard to hear NGOs talk about a “proprietary” curriculum or foundations talk about “we’ll make it open when its ready” (seems like it will never be ready). We need to set a higher bar for everyone involved
Always amazed and blown away by the quality of work being done in the sector and the passion with which people approach it. Truly humbling and super informative to chat with folks on the work they do.
Overall, super-proud of the progress we are making on multiple fronts with Tech4Dev 2.0. Great to see the various groups set goals and targets on what they want to achieve this year

==================================================

This is a slightly belated report on my most recent India trip from Nov 9, 2019 – Nov 18, 2019. It was quite a whirlwind trip, definitely one of the busier ones. A few highlights, thoughts and comments
Day 1 started off in Delhi. Got a great overview from the
Dhwani
folks on what they have been doing over the past few years. The breadth and depth of the work they are doing are incredible, and I do appreciate the amount of expertise Swapnil and Sunandan get to the tech4dev group. We also met with the development team at
Indus Action
and got into a fairly detailed technical deep dive into their campaign management system CMS 2.0 to handle operations for the next academic year. Great to see them consolidating their systems and using relatively new and solid open-source tools.
The next few days were spent in Pune at the Tech4Dev meet which
Rahul has blogged about
. I was happy that we experimented with Day 1 as the sprint day and had a long working session on two different topics. This will definitely be part of our future meetings and does serve as a good anchor for the event. It also allows us to plan, design and maybe even write some code. Overall, it was good to hang out with the group and get to know many of them a lot better. We need to do a better job of keeping everyone involved and participating and also ensure that we give enough background information for the newer folks in the group.
For the tech4dev introductions, we took the opportunity to borrow the limerick introduction idea from Mulago foundation. While it was probably the biggest complaint that people had about the event, it was also cool to see the amount of work, effort, and creativity that people put into it. I do think it is important for all of us to get out of our comfort zones and do something different on a regular basis.
The next two days, I spent with the
Edelgive Foundation
team at their conference
EDGE 2019
. Loved the style and energy of the conference, and the different folks that attended the event. It was good to see an event with no panel discussions and the spotlight on the NGO leaders. I had lots of great conversations with different NGOs on the sidelines.
During the Edelgive events, I saw a demo of a couple of software tools that were built for NGOs in their portfolio. Seems like there is a fair bit of overlap with what we are doing, and hopefully, this relationship will help us build common tools for the sector as a group rather than re-inventing the wheel. I do think that funders and software development shops should do a lot more research both at the open-source end and also user research with multiple different NGOs from the sector, before writing code.
As always, the India trips are super energizing and really help fuel my work when I’m back in San Francisco.Title: India Trip Recap: Goa Sprint, Mumbai Meetings and BLR Sprint

==================================================

Another end-of-trip, another late night at the airport nursing a drink (or two) while waiting for the flight, and another blog post. I’m always amazed, super-energized and exhausted all at the same time after each trip. The trips have been getting longer over time (thanks to the
empty nest syndrome
).
Before I go on about the trip, let me send you down memory lane, by pointing you to the f
irst Glific Blog post
from the vault. Brings back good memories and also nicely illustrates the power of recording things as we go along
This has been slowly happening over the past few sprints, but this one made me realize how amazing the team is. They’ve taken over running the sprint in a nice manner,?with great planning and execution on all fronts, and a significant step up from the previous sprints (especially the early ones which I helped organize). Realistically, I was an observer at the sprint, having lots of conversations with quite a few people, sporadically participating in a few sessions, but taking it all in, and enjoying it. So a few random thoughts, comments and observations
Looking in from the outside, my story @ the sprint 🙂
Highlights
This was our largest sprint, spread over 9 days: Avni team from Day 1 – 5, DCP and Glific from Day 6-8, and Tech4Dev Team from Day 4 – 9. We had 80+ people, 35+ NGOs and 5+ ecosystem partners attend the event during this time. You can read more in the detailed blogs
here
The sprints have grown to a nice size and great space for NGOs to gather and share experiences. This feedback is universal and everyone appreciates the time, space, food, and coffee (mediocre though it was) to have unstructured conversations and interactions
Morning walks have become a tradition, where the walkers get to meet and chat with folks from different organizations in a relaxed manner. The walks meandered through a few small lanes, lots of dogs, and a few gravel paths before ending in the beach (either Anjuna or Baga)
The team had some bonding time on Saturday night, a team-building activity on Sunday morning (which was fun for the most part) and the afternoon off. After that time, everyone was super busy either prepping for the Glific Sprint, the Data Catalyst Program or our Chai-pe-Charcha experiment (inviting local NGOs to see our work)
The Dasra team does know how to organize events. We had a fun party at the beach for the entire group on Thursday evening which helped close the event in style.
Erica, Vinod and I spent a lot of time during the sprint and in Bengaluru talking through and working on Tech4Dev from a management perspective. Really like the way the leadership team is coming together and supporting each other.
Improvements and Potential Changes
For me, the best part of previous sprints was talking to a lot of NGOs and learning more about their work. Unfortunately at this sprint, this happened only during the morning walk. I was quite busy with multiple internal and a few external meetings for most of the days. This needs to change for future events.
The Tech4Dev team by and large did report that while we met the sprint goals, worked with a lot of NGOs etc, we did not get to interact and work with each other as much as we would have liked. Balancing between ecosystem and internal needs is something we need to consider.
The NGOs that are part of the sprint are the NGOs we interact with significantly in our products or cohorts. The loose-nature, super unstructured nature of our very early sprints is missing. We will need to figure out how to balance the needs of the team vs the needs of our NGO partners vs?the needs of our ecosystem.
We had the Data Catalyst Program NGOs (11 NGOs) and the Glific NGOs (15 NGOs) at the event simultaneously.The 11 Avni NGOs had left a few days prior. Getting the NGOs and our team to interact with each other will help with building the community and getting exposed to each others diverse work and tech used
Rest of Trip
I spent a week in Mumbai working from the Dasra Office. Felt good to work in-person and chatting with quite a few folks from the Dasra team. Really glad to see the work we are doing in collaboration with some of the Dasra verticals: Ninad and the finance team, Shrutika and the capacity building team, Kavneet and the data knowledge team, Sonvi and the social compact team.
Our Fractional CxO program has been one of our largest growth areas, both from an NGO perspective and recruiting folks from industry. In the Mumbai week, I spoke to 5 different folks from the tech / research world who were interested in exploring opportunities.
To make up for not catching up with NGOs, I spent a fair bit of time in Mumbai hanging out with Akshay Saxena from Avanti Fellows and Jigyasa Labroo from
Slam Out Loud.
Realized my standing, when I was made her coolie to haul heavy bags, up-and-down the Dasra steps 🙂
My new position: Coolie for NGO leaders (like Jigyasa!)
Had a chance to have a chill dinner with a group of NGO leaders in Mumbai. It was so good fun to hang out with folks in a non-work / funder / partner context and see that side. The stories we heard from people’s past lives and experiences were quite astonishing. Hope to have (and organize) a few more dinners like this one.
Had a few intense conversations specifically with long time friends: Arjav from Svarya and Kuldeep from Reap Benefit. Was good to discusss with them the state of things at Tech4Dev, some of our problems, the pros/cons of a transparent salary system (the one of two things in T4D that is not public), the role we play in the ecosystem, expectations that people have of/from us and more. Lots of food for thought and a few actions to be taken.
We ended the trip with a Dalgo team meeting and FCxO review in Bangalore. Building teams and products is a hard problem and we struggled thru and discussed a few hard issues and challenges as we figure out Dalgo’s roadmap and future
We had a short impressive meeting with Nandan Nilekani who has been funding Tech4Dev. We were prepped really well by Sahana for the meeting and it was a super quick brisk meeting. You can check the

==================================================

Another India trip, another bout of inspiration, validation, energy and excitement. Trying to condense my thoughts and feelings as I get ready to head back home to spend time with the kids – Maya and PJ, as they come back from college. I just look back at amazement over the past year and see how far we’ve come along and how much we’ve grown. Such an awesome feeling!
Sachin
and
Supriya
were kind enough to invite me for the
Agami
Summit
which coincided with the start of my India trip. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the legal and justice space, I figure this could be a good way to immerse myself and learn a wee bit. The event was amazing and super well organized and curated. Over 250+ people were present at the amazing
Asia Plateau center of Initiatives of Change
(sight of a future Tech4Dev sprint for sure!). I learned a lot about
Online Dispute Resolution
in my drive up to Panchgani with
Vinay from CORD
. Also spent a fair bit of the conference learning from multiple participants in the
OpenNyAI
sessions. The team from
Ooloi labs
(Akshay and Yashna) did a great job facilitating the multiple day session and
Smita Gupta
spent a fair bit of time giving me an overview of the space. So a super awesome learning experience for me. Agami has done an amazing job of integrating the commercial sector in their work, and giving them a good presence at the event. We definitely can learn from that in our next conference. From a technology perspective, I did not get a great sense of who the consumer or participant is of the solution. I suspect this is more due to my limited understanding of the space. It was great to see two of Tech4Dev’s NGO partners:
Indus Action
and
Mobile Vaani
be recipients of the Agami Prize. I also spent some time with a few NGO colleagues and funders, many of whom, I had only seen on Zoom calls. The conversations solidified that we are on the right path especially with our platform and Fractional CxO initiatives.
I then headed to Pune to meet a few folks from Team Tech4Dev who would not be at the Jaipur retreat: Arun, Ankit and a new product person who will be joining us in mid January. Always great to meet folks in person, and give them the background and history behind the work we’ve done at Tech4Dev. It was then off to Jaipur to meet the team and kickoff an in-person week of work and meetings.
A year ago, we did not have any employees in India working with NGOs. Our model was quite good at building the ecosystem, but seems like something was holding us back. My meeting with Shilpa from ON approx. 9 months ago, was a good nudge towards building a team in India. This has allowed us to do things faster and deeper. Today, I’m blown away to see and interact with the team of 10+ folks, led by Erica Arya. The quality and experience of the people we’ve been able to hire are super impressive (except for engineering talent), and we have a steady stream of excellent resumes coming in. We are also figuring out the areas where we can improve, specifically in the area of sales and marketing, and better financial models.
Another interesting event at the sprint was the validation of our open source model. We had
Gramhal
be part of the sprint, since we wanted to ensure that we could deploy an instance of Glific on their infrastructure. We are using this partnership to ensure that Glific can operate at scale, i.e. ability to deliver 2L+ messages/hour for a single organization. Using an open-source platform like Glific, allows Gramhal to operate the service at infrastructure costs only. This will result in a cost saving of 3x at least, i.e. from a monthly bill of 3L to an expected bill of under 1L. This has implications on our revenue model, but since our primary focus is to benefit the ecosystem, the tradeoff is well worth it. Things that benefit the larger ecosystem, strengthen us all.
A few random thoughts after a few sprints in some amazing locations. In the past year, in addition to the big cities. I’ve spent time in Tehri, GarudMaachi, Panchgani, and Jaipur. All wonderful and places in their own right. The locations ensure that the community be “in the present”, focus on relationships, and do a lot of knowledge sharing. However, we do travel a fair distance, but do not really get to immerse ourselves in the surroundings for more than a few hours (at best). Seems like we need to revisit sprint locations, and also figure out if we can invite a few local NGOs for broader exposure. Personally, I do need to figure out how I can take advantage of these locations and spend more time there either before / after the event.
Managed to have a long conversation with Deval from Dasra, a long time friend and my mentor in the NGO world in India. As we work with more NGOs across India, it’s important for us to build on Dasra’s experience and expertise and collaborate with them in a tighter manner. It also helps our employees to see the larger picture, learn from what has worked (or not worked in the past) and interact with folks who have been engaged in the ecosystem for some time.
To end the trip, in great timing, Neelam, an amazing young woman from
Sharanam Center
got married on Saturday. It’s such a joy to see these young women grow and thrive. Seems like we have come full circle with these women as they embark into their next phase of their life and careers. It’s also great to see how Sharda and Karen keep upping the game by helping and supporting the next group to aspire even higher. Its a constantly learning and evolving journey.Title: India Trip Report – Aug 2019 – Week 2

This is part 2 of the Trip to India Report. You can read
Part 1 here
The second week was focused primarily on meeting philanthropists and people who have had a fair bit of experience and expertise in the sector. I attended the meetings with a combination of Arjav and Rahul from Lumen and Kurund from Web Access. In addition to our
info deck
, we also went into the meetings with a list of questions and thoughts that we wanted to discuss during the meeting. Some of these questions included:
Physical presence in India, what should our approach be, and things we should consider
Our medium-term goals (3+ years), how should we think about it. Benefits of working with small to medium orgs vs medium to large orgs? How aggressive should we be with working with govt either directly or indirectly
Scale vs Depth vs Breadth? Should we focus on a few orgs with potentially high impact or do a combination of orgs from small to large, and help the sector as a whole
How can we measure our impact? What should we be doing in the short term to ensure we can get a few answers for this in the next couple of years.
Since tech education and training are as important to orgs, how should we go about it? What can we do to raise the level of NGO awareness of technology and systems?
Our info deck and pitch was well received by everyone. Different individuals had different perspectives on some of the questions above, but a few general takeaways did emerge;
If we are in this for the long term, we need to ensure that we set up a physical presence to match our objectives. Partnerships are a good short-medium term solution, but we should consider setting up our own organization. Starting the process is worth it, since the process takes a fair bit of time, and it gives us flexibility if needed.
We need to have a better process, selection criteria and due diligence for future cohorts.?
We need to have a good rationale for why we are focussing on programmatic technology only and ignoring backend technology
We need to start collecting data about the impact on all our organizations. It might be different for each org, but it will allow us to take a closer look and make sense of it a few cohorts down the line when we have data across similar organizations
We need to explain why a lightweight, central team with a lot of trust and responsibility on the software partners will work. This is still a work in progress as we are improving our processes and introducing new ones. Maybe drawing parallels to trust-based
philanthropy
is worth it.?
I?d also like to highlight a few things in our plan which we felt resonated with most people in our meetings quite nicely
Reusing solutions across multiple organizations
Our plans on building generic platforms as we learn more about the problems that NGOs want to solve via technology
The variety in the type and size of orgs that we work with across the sector
The transparency in our work and processes
Overall it was a really good trip. We’ve come out with a lot more things to think about and action items from this trip that are just starting to tackle and work on. These trips are super energizing and at the same time quite exhausting. Curious to see what we can accomplish over the next six months.Title: India Visit – July/Aug 2019 – Week 1

==================================================

We typically volunteer and learn more about a couple of NGOs in the summer by volunteering with the family. This is typically the best part of the year for me. Unfortunately, the kids are growing up and have their own agenda which gave Mari and me
time to visit a few NGOs
and then time for me to spend doing Project Tech4Dev related work.
The first week was spent fine-tuning
our information deck
with our friends at
Lumen
. We will be using it when are presenting Project Tech4Dev to individuals and foundations over the next week.
We also met a few NGO partners of the first cohort and had a
structured conversation
with them about their experience with T4D and the software partner. The answers we received were quite illuminating and or goal is to talk to all the NGOs of the first cohort by the end of this month. Our preliminary findings will be discussed in a forthcoming blog post. A few highlights
How can we empower the NGO to drive the process and conversation with the software partner
How do we improve the communication between the software partner and the NGO
Can we do an orientation before the actual grant starts for all the NGO partners to give them a better overview and understanding of what’s involved
On Friday, we went to Pune to meet a couple of potential partner companies and individuals. The biggest thing that struck me was how different individuals have significantly different opinions on the scale, depth, and uniformity of the problem. They also have very different ideas on how to address the problem. This allows us to take a step back and question some of our underlying assumptions and also try to see the problem space from a very different perspective. We did get a few questions (below) where we do not have really solid answers and we’ll work on explaining our thoughts better
Why are we not addressing the backend software systems? Do we have enough data or evidence to indicate it is a close to a solved problem
What’s our ultimate goal? What do we want to see happen in the next five years? Where should we be at that time?
Should we focus on a small set of large organizations that have the potential to scale to a million people and more, or should we focus on a large number of medium-sized organizations that can scale to a hundred thousand people and more?
What role can or should we play in deploying software in government systems
Overall, I always come away from most of my trips amazed and humbled. It is great to see the work on the ground and how we are making small inroads, at the same time, we are also realizing that we can and should dream a lot broader and bigger to make a solid impact.Title: India Visit – Summer 2019

==================================================

For the first time in a few years, we were not volunteering at an Indian NGO with our kids and friends in the summer. You can read some of our past summer essays
here (2018)
and
here (2017)
. The kids decided to do their own stuff, with Maya attending a summer program in California and PJ coming to India with
Indiaspora
. You can read some of her thoughts on visiting India without her parents
here
. It is great to read the
experiences
from her cohort, definitely gives you something to think about. Luckily for us, our friends Bhuva and family took up the baton in our absence and volunteered with one of our favorite organizations:
17000ft.org
. Their essays will be coming up soon.
Mari and I spent a few days visiting a few of our partner NGOs. It is always great to see the work on the ground and learn from the staff there. We first visited the
Institute of Health Management (Pachod)
where we got an in-depth look at how they do both quantitative and qualitative research and how in turn that influences their community interventions. Dr. Ashok and team were super welcoming to the two interns we had with us: Audrey from Indiana Univesity and Sabina from Nirmala Niketan and Sharanam Center. Before the end of the day, we had our hands full of reading material.
We also spent time with the girls and young women @
Sharanam Center for Girls in Dharavi.
I’m always surprised how much they have grown since the last time we saw them (though ironically, we don’t see our children growing since we see them every day!) and I love our interaction and discussions with them. The older goals want to teach Mari Hindi and they were negotiating the trips and internships with us for next summer. Now, that’s planning ahead! We are just so grateful to Sharada and Karen for spending so much time and energy and nurturing these girls into amazing young women. For us, in Mumbai, they are our family (or my sister would say, they are even more important than the rest of the family)
We also went and spent some time with Suparna and Neeti from
Aangan Trust
. The constant need to think about and implement changes to their programs and introduce new programs to keep the community engaged and active is within the DNA of Aangan. I’m always surprised to see what they are up to next, and more importantly why and how they keep the community involved and also at the same time transition ownership and responsibility to the community. We spent a bit of time with one of their young women and mothers group discussing the topic of cybersecurity and how to be safe on the phone. The “phone behavior” of the youth in this group seems so different than the teens in our home, and I’m still trying to figure out and the reason the what and the why? One prevailing (and long-standing) theory is that teens involved in sports and other activities outside of school are super busy and hence do not have as much time to spend online and hence they optimize it with stuff that they know and love.
It was a short quick trip for Mari and she returned home to pick Maya from Irvine, while I stayed back to do some work on
Project Tech4Dev
I did miss spending three to four week with an NGO and doing stuff with the kids. However, I’m starting to accept the fact that those days might be long gone, but we do hope to come back and spend more time as a family with a lot more NGOs sometime in the near future.Title: Indus Action: Chatbot project update

Web Access
has been working with the
Indus Action
team to build a Chatbot that will be used by its beneficiaries.  You can find the initial assessment of the project in this previous
blog post
.
Here are the key features that were implemented as a part of this project.
* Multilingual: English and Hindi
* Ability to get information about different stages in the application process
* Report Grievance
* View profile
* Ask for help
* Policy related details
IA Bot is a Facebook-based bot which will be available on Indus Action?s Facebook page.
We have completed the project and the project handover is done to the Indus Action team.Title: Indus Action: Chatbot project update

Section 12(1) (c) of the The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates inclusive classrooms by setting aside 25% seats in entry level classes of private unaided schools for children belonging to disadvantaged groups (DG) and economically weaker sections (EWS).
1.5 million of the 2.2 million seats available nationally under RTE Section 12(1)(c) go vacant every year. Indus Action aims to address the awareness and capacity gaps in the implementation of this provision through a mix of technology interventions, community outreach and process support throughout and after the admissions process.
Indus Action currently runs operations in 11 states. Over the last 3 years, we have reached out to over 3.5 lakh beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries through our awareness campaigns. Our Partner Entrepreneur Network aims to mobilise local entrepreneurs to build on Indus Action?s experiences of running campaigns for 5 years to enhance RTE outcomes.
Indus Action would like to build an AI Chatbot that would allow the beneficiary to seek quick responses on the RTE 12(1)(c) application process without having to wait for a call back from the Shiksha Sahyogis. This will be the first line of interaction that a beneficiary faces with Indus Action?s support system, they could then choose to escalate their concern to a manual operator. Indus Action, on the other hand, would collect beneficiary information directly from user inputs on the chatbot, place them at an appropriate stage in the application process and tailor its support to the beneficiary based on these findings.
So far, the Indus Action Campaign App does not have a beneficiary facing component. Beneficiary data is collected by Shiksha Sahyogis as they respond to missed calls. This data is then validated by our calling quality assurance process. Beneficiaries currently do not have any means of accessing their data (except for the long drawn out process of making a formal request to Indus Action?s data controller), nor do they have any means of getting prompt support.
Web Access evaluated following Chatbot options:
* DialogFlow
* IBM Watson
* Botsociety
* Rasa Stack
After discussion with Indus Action team and based on the requirements it was decided to go with DialogFlow. The project is divided into 2 phases.
Phase 1
* Setup basic framework and structure for the project
* Create a Facebook Messenger based bot
Phase 2
* Create a WhatsApp based bot
As a part of tech4dev initiative, Phase 1 will be implemented. We are making steady progress and hoping to wrap this project by end of March.Title: Inside Glific: Story of the Team’s Evolution
Author: Radhika Bhagwat
Date: August 2025
Category: Glific

==================================================

I joined Project Tech4Dev in October 2023, just as the organization was wrapping up its second year. At the time, I was excited to join a team building open-source technology for the social sector, and even more so to contribute to a product that had already gained considerable traction. Almost two years later, I find myself reflecting on how much has changed—not just in terms of what we’ve built, but how we’ve built it, together.
At Goa Sprint Jan 2024
Glific team then:
Glific was thriving as a product platform and growing in numbers as a team. The senior leaders guiding the team had done well to support the team and the platform in the past couple of years. Values of openness and excellence were brewing strong when I joined. From the start, it was clear that the Glific team here was deeply invested in building something meaningful and useful for the social sector. Though to scale, grow and sustain Glific, we had to change the older ways a little.
Siloed Functions
When I came on board, Glific was structured around three primary teams: development, product and support, and sales and business development. These groups had fairly clear boundaries, both in terms of leadership and day-to-day operations. The development team was led separately from the rest, and they held their own standups. Product and support were grouped together, and sales operated with its own rhythm. While this setup wasn’t inherently flawed, it did mean that information, priorities, and context didn’t always flow across teams. It was very possible to be doing great work in your area while having little to no idea what another part of the organization was focused on.
Despite that fragmentation, the product itself was in a strong place. It had grown to support over 65 active bots, many of which were being used by social impact organizations across India and beyond. The platform had already proven it could scale to a moderate level and was stable enough to support meaningful engagement. There was a growing list of feature requests and product improvements coming in from partners, internal stakeholders, and the community. But the way we decided what to build—and who was involved in those decisions—needed evolution.
Engineering led Product
At the time, the development roadmap was largely led by the engineering team. They were deeply familiar with the architecture, quick to prototype, and efficient at building. Product and support were occasionally looped in for clarifications or validations, but the process lacked a structured handover or joint planning framework. Sales and support, meanwhile, were often downstream from these decisions, unaware of what was being developed or when something was going live. There wasn’t a single source of truth for upcoming releases or priorities, which made it difficult for them to plan conversations with partners or train support staff effectively. Moreover, the way the team operated didn’t give anyone other than the dev team the backing to give their opinion without having the fear of failing. Hardline from the dev leadership pushed the other tracks to fall in line. Priorities developed into the platform were most times informed by NGO needs (at least in initial years), but prioritization was adhoc, mostly a single person making the call.
Fragmented Leadership
Product and Biz dev had a separate senior leader than Dev, with very different style of leadership and priorities. One was methodical and intentional, almost driving perfection and the other was biased for action to deliver fast with least process. This confused the teams, who didn’t really have high level values and principles to go by. Most decisions made within the team were run by both leaders, eventually slowing things down.
Questioning leaders was also not a norm. Very few members actually did so. Even though the org would push people to give their opinion and question decisions, senior leadership’s answers either appeared to be dictating, opinionated or at times questioning seemed like insubordination.
Scale and Growth meant Change:
The first chapter in Glific’s story had set the stage and was closing, with the next chapter looking at making the foundation stronger, before building on top – After observing the structure for a few weeks, I began to document some of the friction points I saw—not in a critical way, but as constructive feedback with suggestions for improvement. My goal wasn’t to slow anyone down; it was to make our processes more inclusive and transparent, so that everyone had the context they needed to do their job well. I also had to ensure I don’t bring in processes for the sake of it, especially since I used them at Amazon, and they worked. I had to ensure I listened first and advised later; keeping in account the team and its members before pushing changes in. I shared these notes with leadership, and to their credit, they took the feedback seriously and encouraged me to implement some of the proposed changes.
Blurring Boundaries, Unifying Silos
What followed was a slow but steady reorientation in how we worked as a team. We didn’t tear anything down overnight. Instead, we started by integrating some basic rituals—like including product representation in dev standups daily. It sounds small, but simply having dev and product in the same virtual room each morning made a huge difference. This alignment fostered a new level of empathy and reduced the surprises on all sides. After a few months, I also started indicating to the senior leaders that the standups could be less formal and would not need their time; this was to mitigate the observer effect in the team. I observed how the standups flowed smoothly when leadership didn’t attend these standups, while when they did, abrupt questions from them digressed the team’s standup. Instead I decided to update the leadership about weekly and monthly decisions and KPIs through weekly updates doc (if they were curious) and monthly review meetings, with ownership rotating among the team.
Transparent Prioritization
We also introduced a more transparent planning and prioritization process. We moved toward a shared backlog and open discussions around what we should build next and why. Individuals would brainstorm for a bottom up roadmap or feedback from partners, and we worked together to evaluate what made sense for the product, what was feasible technically, and what had the greatest potential impact. Product started playing a more central role in facilitating these conversations, ensuring that trade-offs were clear and that everyone had a voice.
Open Communication
Another important shift was the introduction of regular demo sessions. Before any new feature was released, we’d walk through it together—developers showing what they built, product explaining the use case, and support and sales flagging any questions or potential confusion. These sessions weren’t just about checking boxes; they created a loop of feedback that helped catch issues early and improve usability. It also gave support and sales time to prepare documentation, training, or partner communication before anything hit production. Overtime fCxOs attending these sessions have helped immensely in reconsidering some design decisions and use cases before things are baked in.
Over time, we saw our structure shift from a collection of teams to a truly cross-functional unit. We began to take more collective ownership of the product, the process, and the outcomes. Developers started asking questions about user behavior and partner feedback. Support folks contributed to product design. Sales team members helped clarify edge cases and offered real-world examples that improved our user flows. Instead of gatekeeping information, we were sharing it. Instead of handing off tasks, we were collaborating. A defining moment for me personally in witnessing this collaboration was the 2024 Accelerator, where the entire team came together. Nothing was tossed over the wall and forgotten, the 3 month initiative from marketing to final demo was overseen by a single-threaded-owner, and everyone owned their part. I felt so proud to be part of the Glific team!!
Autonomy = Experiment—>Fail-Iterate-Innovate
I strive to bring accessibility to leadership for everyone in the team, with a level of comfort that allows them to question decisions and state their opinions. This is a gradual transition that I still don’t see in the lesser tenured members in the team. Everyone in the team
has a level of autonomy
that enables them to
experiment and innovate. I hope to see everyone leverage it.
This autonomy is not about doing whatever one wants, but about knowing that every individual owns and has “founded” the organization. Their decisions pave the way and it comes with equal amounts of responsibility and accountability. I’ve seen individuals in the team grow in their career over these past 2 years, with this added autonomy and trust that has been bestowed upon them. Do they make mistakes, yes of course! But we learn from them, and it allows the team to know they can take risks, and should not be afraid of failing. The senior leaders at Project Tech4Dev have also given me similar autonomy, which I don’t take lightly. I look forward to the Glific team thriving and innovating in the space available to them at Glific and Project Tech4Dev.
Coaching and Mentoring
As a people manager, one of the things I truly cherished was my 1:1s with my managers and teams. I knew how important consistent weekly or bi-weekly catch-ups were to individuals. Even though some would not open up and have much on their agenda, if I missed any 1:1, I would hear from them to schedule one soon. I didn’t see this as a norm in Tech4Dev. Most catch-ups happened in sprints, which were quarterly. Some lucky ones happened monthly. Knowing how much 1:1s play a part in motivating the team, I wanted to make it a norm with all my directs. For over a year I also met with my skip-levels monthly. But now that I see my managers growing into their people manager shoes, I have made my skip levels into office hours. I hear back quite frequently of how much my team looks forward to these 1:1s (as much as I do), and knowing it helps the individual and ripple effects on the entire team’s motivation, makes me ensure I never skip one.
Glific Team at Q1 2025 Reflection Exercise
Today
This transformation wasn’t perfect or linear. We had to work through overlaps in responsibility, conflicting priorities, and different communication styles. But the key was that we were committed to working through it together. Leadership supported the transition, encouraged experimentation, and gave teams the autonomy to define new processes. That level of trust created space for us to take initiative and improve things organically, rather than waiting for top-down directives.
Now, nearly two years in, the way Glific operates feels fundamentally different. We make faster decisions, not because we cut corners, but because we’re more aligned and empowered. Everyone knows what’s being built, when it’s shipping, and why it matters. We still have room to grow—we always will—but the foundation feels stronger than ever. We’ve moved from reacting to requests to proactively shaping the product in ways that reflect the needs of our partners and users.
Reflecting on this journey, I’m proud of the changes we’ve made—not just in the platform, but in the culture. We’ve gone from a well-meaning but disjointed setup to a unified team that’s more resilient, responsive, and deeply collaborative. Invariably, change also means loosing on some of the positive aspects of a smaller team that functioned like a new startup. With the founding member and a couple of developers, we could whip out a decently large feature in a few weeks. With a fairly new dev team and added operational and customer support responsibilities, that velocity has gone down. Though this trade-off seems fair and balanced for now, given that Glific’s USP is a fast and comprehensive support and features being pushed out are prioritized on usage and impact; we do need to stay agile and increase the velocity of building and experimenting as we push on.
Looking ahead, I’m excited about what’s next. We have a lot to improve on, big ambitions for the product, more organizations to support, and plenty of challenges to solve.
I would like to attribute the openness in this post to the senior leaders of Project Tech4Dev, who are willing to be open to critical feedback and live the org values of Openness, Transparency, and Trust in their day-to-day. I hope each and everyone (incl. myself) is able to take something away from them and carry this culture on, ourselves, everyday!Title: Insights and some awesome moments from The Glific Sprint

This blog is written by Tashi from
The Apprentice Project
A week before the sprint I found myself looking at a spreadsheet with some delight and a good amount of surprise. Why? My name read as an attendee for the Tech4Dev Education Cohort Sprint at Dehradun, at this point I was trying to make sense of it as a work conference, a networking event, or a recreational event. Maybe I have an answer for this now. It was a super event with all the elements of work, recreation, community building, and collaboration.
Flagged off my sprint with a quick round gaze of the lush green and picturesque campus of The Sal Woods, filled with calm and tranquility, murmuring “Go out there, have an open mind, and engage with the community”. An awesome exercise conducted by Tejas got us connecting effortlessly. Expressing our first impressions, expectations, wins, and challenges marked the start of the wonderful and productive time ahead.
The same evening I resonated with a concern expressed by Mr. Rishi Majumdar from
Quest Alliance
regarding students bouncing from one platform to another in their learning process. My interest piqued on seeing the solution that is being developed by Quest alliance and ooloi labs to counter this issue and develop computational thinking in due process. I wanted to dive deep into this, Rishi was very generous with his time and all the help offered in getting a good overview of it.
Before the sprint I was working on onboarding some new tech resources for my organization
The Apprentice Project
and was always on the lookout for the ideal approach that one should follow, I was inspired by the interaction I had with Ms. Vandana Vasudev from
Bhumi
and their use of technology, I would like to express my gratitude for all the resources that were exchanged and look forward to an exciting collaboration in the schooling space. A very similar possibility of a collaboration headed towards me when Mr. Rahul Bangar from
VOPA
generously offered to incorporate the TAPs socio-emotional learning curriculum within their V-school platform to widen its reach. Collaborating on strengths seemed so very enterprising and am eager to take this up with my manager and pursue it further.
Evening work sessions were usually followed by recreation activities two such mentions would be a short hike in the vicinity that helped me connect with folks on a personal level, get a closer look into their journey in this sector and explore possibilities of collaboration, and exchange learnings from their experiences. Folks pumped up, geared and ready to face the brunt of the rain made our trip to Mussoorie all special. Wandering cluelessly through the mall road admiring the local crafts displayed on shelves we made our way to Little Llamas cafe for an absolute cracker of a time that overshot our stay but we made it back in time.
I would like to extend my gratitude to the
Glific
team for having us at the sprint and for creating a space that helped us connect, explore and initiate collaboration with each other. A special thanks to Mr. Lobo, Kurund, Erica, Abhishek, and Mohit for helping me understand this initiative, its roots, and the motive going ahead. I had an amazing experience at the sprint and am already excited and looking forward to the next one.Title: Insights from the Data Catalyst Program: Learn, Unlearn, Re-learn

By – Ramlal Suthar & Dyu Pattnaik, Educate Girls
We appreciate our participation in the Data Catalyst Program. It was fantastic, and we are eager to keep going. Big thanks to Project Tech4 Dev, Dasra, Goalkeep, and Agency Fund. In addition to our program partners, the exchange of ideas and insights among all participants has been truly great. We have learned a lot from each other, and this program will help us share and implement ideas to improve our organization.
The two days of in-person training sessions gave us insights that we categorized into what we learned, unlearned, and re-learned.
Learn:
The data levers by Goalkeep were really helpful in understanding our data challenges and framing the problem statement. We also learned to assess our organization’s data culture using these levers and work on the required subdomains.The scenario-based sessions taught us essential data leadership skills, and we picked up some useful tricks for optimizing dashboard loading time.
Unlearn:
We relied solely on the theory of change to measure impact but the funnel metrics showed us a new way to assess program effectiveness and identify bottlenecks. We realized that running RCTs is not as daunting as we thought. While we might not run sophisticated RCTs, running small experiments can help us evaluate programs and gain useful insights.Making visualizations that can convey actionable information in ten seconds, even if they are not fancy, was really helpful.
Re-learn:
Thinking about the user and asking clear, measurable questions when designing data processes was truly beneficial. Emphasizing the use of technology for data collection with proper validation and checks is a lesson that we need to keep reinforcing. Maintaining data quality during collection, building data repositories and creating reports and dashboards are crucial for any organization.Title: Introducing Glific recipes

Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: January 2025
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/jan-2025-dalgo-sprint-in-mahabalipuram/
==================================================

We just wrapped up another sprint for Dalgo, and this one was special. The location was incredible—right by the beach with perfect weather. This time, we invited NGOs that work with Dalgo, and we were thrilled that some could join us. Having them there added a new layer to our discussions and gave us valuable insights.
This sprint felt different in the best way. We had plenty of time to dive deep into both internal and external conversations, and we made the most of it. One big highlight? Ashwin joined us as the new Dalgo Lead. His presence has already shifted the team dynamic in a positive way—everyone seems more motivated, and there’s a stronger sense of trust across the board.
During our time together, we focused on two main areas:
1. The Dalgo Roadmap
We spent time looking at where Dalgo is headed and where we want to go next. One big takeaway was that we need to think beyond just our current tech stack. While it’s served us well, it’s also limited our ability to tackle some use cases. It felt great to see the team align on this idea—we’re ready to expand our approach.
A big part of our future involves making Dalgo more accessible and useful to a wider range of people and organizations. To do that, we need to collaborate with NGOs and help them understand how better data usage can drive their work forward.
After chatting with some of the NGOs, we identified a few key areas where we can focus:
User-Friendly Data Transformation Tools
Integrated Chat Features
Tools for Better Presentations and Storytelling
Operational Reviews with Qualitative Insights
The feedback from NGOs reassured us that we’re on the right track, but it also reminded us to stay focused. We’ve already partnered with a few NGOs who are excited to work with us on these ideas, and we’re eager to get started.
2. Better Ways to Work Together
Ashwin shared an important observation: our engineers should spend more time working directly with clients, while the consulting team could focus more on improving the product. This would give engineers a better understanding of client needs and give the consulting team breathing room to refine the product.
After discussing this as a team, we came up with two key changes:
Innovation Time
We’ll set aside one week in every sprint for innovation. This will give everyone time to explore new ideas or work on something that improves the product.
Client Engagement for Engineers
Engineers will be tagged to help with specific data issues for clients. This way, they can have direct conversations with clients and gain a deeper understanding of their challenges.
NGOs focused sessions and workshops
In this sprint, we brought together NGOs and partners to explore how AI and data can drive impact in the social sector. Our goal was to create a space where attendees could dive deep into tools and concepts like Dalgo, AI, and data, leaving with actionable insights to inspire new directions in their work.
Day 1:
Setting the Stage
We began with an engaging ice-breaking session led by Pratiksha, setting a welcoming tone and fostering connections among participants. Rohit followed with an insightful presentation on Dalgo, covering its key features and how it addresses challenges in data management for NGOs. The day concluded with hands-on sessions where we collaborated with NGOs to tackle specific problems related to data pipelines, analytics, and foundational concepts in Dalgo.
Day 2:
Workshop on AI
The second day was dedicated to an AI workshop tailored for non-profits. The session aimed to:
Help NGOs understand the transformative potential of AI for their operations.
Showcase tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and others that can address real-world challenges.
Offer hands-on practice through practical exercises and use case exploration.
We began by introducing AI concepts and real-world examples of its application in the non-profit sector. NGOs shared their challenges, which led to deeper discussions on potential AI-driven solutions. A key highlight was the “Chat with Data” demo, where participants explored how AI could analyze their data and provide actionable insights.
Practical Challenges with Data
Aditya led a thought-provoking session on challenges related to data, showcasing GoalKeep’s unqiue approach of presenting ideas in a way that encourages deeper thinking. It was a powerful reminder of how innovative perspectives can reshape our understanding of complex issues.
Later, Sanjeev and I had an engaging conversation with representatives from the Bhumi Foundation. They shared the difficulties they face in collecting data at the grassroots level, particularly in convincing their beneficiaries to provide the required information. As we delved deeper into the issue, it became clear that the challenge wasn’t just about gathering data—it was about effectively communicating the purpose and value of data collection. They acknowledged the need for better messaging to explain why the data matters and how it ultimately benefits their community, fostering trust and participation in the process.
Work Time with NGOs
I spent some time with various NGOs, having some great conversations:
Aditya from ATECF
: We talked about his work with us on Dalgo and their use of Superset. He mentioned they need maps to show their data better, which is something we can improve.
Antarang
: We discussed their database setup and ways to improve data quality.
Dhwani
: They shared some issues they’re facing with Survey CTO, and we explored possible solutions.
Sneha
: We talked about what they need in their dashboards and how storytelling features could make their reports more engaging.
Social Bytes
: I showed them how easy it is to manage their data pipeline and use dbt, which they found helpful.
Arghyam:
On their needs for better visualization which is why they want to try power BI and need some help connecting the warehouse.
That’s it. I think we had a great sprint and every ngo learned a lot from these sessions and conversations.
Few Take Aways From the Sprint
One great moment during the sprint was meeting
Om
, a new hire, who shared a really inspiring story. He told me that last year, while I was working with
Aviraj from C4GT
, I encouraged Aviraj to take part in a hackathon. Aviraj later encouraged Om to do the same, and Om ended up winning the same hackathon focused on Airbyte. After that, Aviraj introduced him to the
AVNI team
, where he got hired, and now he’s working with them.
For me, this was a perfect example of why building a
supportive ecosystem
is so important. Seeing how one small action led to opportunities for others was a great reminder of the impact
collaboration
can have.
I had a discussion with Ashwin, Vinod, and Pratiksha about improving how we approach consulting. Instead of charging NGOs based on the number of charts or dashboards we deliver, we explored focusing on the value we provide. This approach emphasizes meaningful impact rather than simply delivering outputs.
My experience with
ATECF
highlighted how important it is to spend time truly understanding what NGOs do, the problems they aim to solve, and the programs they run. When you show genuine interest and effort in understanding their work, it builds trust. This approach worked well with ATECF, and it’s something we should adopt more broadly with other NGOs.
We also talked about the importance of guiding NGOs when they’re unclear about their data needs. This includes spending more time helping them understand their data and educating them on how to use it effectively to achieve better outcomes.
We agreed that this approach could add significant value, but we need to think through how best to implement it. This includes figuring out the specific support we can provide and assessing the effort required from our side to make it work.
This sprint was a big step forward for Dalgo and its goal to support NGOs with better tools and insights. Having NGOs join the sprint made our discussions richer and gave us new ideas on how to improve. From finding ways to make Dalgo easier to use to focusing on meaningful support, every conversation helped us better understand and address the needs of the NGOs we work with.Title: Jal Jeevan Mission – Arghyam

==================================================

The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM),
launched by the Government of India in 2019, aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections to every rural household by 2024. At its inception, only 3.23 crore (17%) rural households had tap water connections, but the mission has set an ambitious goal of adding nearly 16 crore additional households, benefiting over 19 crore rural families. As of August 2024, JJM has achieved significant progress, providing tap water connections to 11.82 crore more rural households, raising total coverage to over 15.07 crore households, or 77.98% of all rural households. The mission emphasizes a community-based approach, encouraging local ownership through contributions of cash, kind, or labor (shramdaan) and prioritizes sustainable water supply systems, infrastructure functionality, and resource maintenance. Additionally, it focuses on developing skilled human resources in construction, plumbing, water quality management, and catchment protection, creating a lasting impact on health, quality of life, and rural empowerment.
Arghyam
, supports JJM’s objectives in partnership with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and government departments, working to establish sustainable water supply systems across Indian states. With JJM’s remarkable national coverage expansion from 16% to over 78%, Arghyam has aligned its efforts through three thematic divisions:
Operations & Maintenance, Water Quality, and Source Sustainability.
These areas of focus help ensure the longevity and quality of rural water systems. Additionally, Arghyam runs the India Water Portal (IWP), an online platform providing a space for academia, researchers, and practitioners to share insights, foster public discourse, and address issues in water, sanitation, and climate change, further advancing the mission’s transformative impact on India’s rural landscape.
Currently, 3 states in India are being focused on through  projects that are developed based on geohydrological contexts as well as the priorities and approach of these state governments regarding water supply and management in rural areas.
Sl No

Besides these thematic priorities and focused geographies, Argyam’s strategy is aimed at working at scale by leveraging technology as an enabler and integrating robust social processes to strengthen the system. Each of the Arghyam projects are designed with digital deployment and tech innovation as the mainstay of the intervention.
Data Collection Method
Avni is an open-source task tracker tool, which has been developed by Samanvay- Learning and Development Foundation. The tool has been used in different sectors, such as education and health, especially by Frontline functionaries such as ASHA, teachers, CSO workers and program managers to deliver and monitor their programmes across multiple states of India.
In Bihar, Avni has been rolled out by Arghyam partner agency Aga Khan Rural Support Programme India (AKRSP-I) to track the mandated tasks at the pipe water supply level by its PWS operators   also known as Anurakshak/ Pump-operator. Through the Avni app, 5 tasks are being captured at PWS(pipe water supply system) by Anuarakshak, which are as follows:-
Here’s a breakdown of what each form captures:
1. Tank Cleaning
Purpose
: To document the regular cleaning of water tanks, which is essential for maintaining water quality and safety.
Data Collected

5. Water Quality Testing
Purpose
: To monitor water quality by testing for chemical and biological contaminants, ensuring the safety of drinking water.
Data Collected
:
Dates of entry, sample collection, and testing
Sampling points (source, household, institution, etc.)
Chemical parameters: pH, Total Hardness, Alkalinity, Chloride, Nitrate, Arsenic, Fluoride, Iron
Biological parameter: Bacteriological contamination
Frequency
: As per the testing schedule
Importance
: This testing provides critical data on water safety, enabling quick responses to contamination issues and ensuring compliance with health standards.
Each form in the Avni app thus plays a key role in PWS functionality, supporting both operational tracking and community engagement for a sustainable and safe water supply system.
As of now, Anuarakshaks have used Avni in 3 blocks of Muzaffarpur and efforts are on to take it to 7 districts and 8 blocks. Also, simultaneous efforts are being made to influence the government by advocating its utility and relevance through trusted data generation and improved visibility made available through the Anuarakshak dashboard.
mGramSeva:
mGramseva is a portal developed by the eGovernment Foundation for managing income and expenditure at the PWS level digitally. Through its partners, Arghyam has rolled out mGramseva to 3 blocks of the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, and efforts are being made to scale this to 10 blocks across 7 districts of Bihar.
mGramSeva allows Anurakshaks to track the financial management of the  water connections in their area of coverage, the consumers for these connections, and these consumers’ billing and payment histories. It also helps them track the expenses they incurred on the operation and maintenance of the pipe water supply system such as remuneration to pump operator, plumbing cost , consumables for FTK /water testing , repair cost , electricity bill etc .
Engagement with DALGO on developing Integrated Dashboard:-
Arghyam has partnered with DALGO to develop an integrated dashboard from PWS physical and financial performance by pulling data from the both apps. The team has already developed unified Avni and mGramSeva dashboards. The final step remaining is to integrate these dashboards into the mGramSeva application.
Dalgo Adoption
Challenges Before
Problem with Consolidation and Visualization:
The key challenge was consolidating and visualizing data from Avni and mGramSeva into a unified dashboard for Anurakshaks. Although there was a silo dashboard for AVNI in the metabase but that doesn’t give a unified dashboard across two sources.
Unique Access Requirement:
Each Anurakshak requires a unique URL for personalized access, allowing them to view only their own dashboard and this needs to integrate with mGramSeva users to see their dashboard.
mGramSeva will help them with unique username in the url parameters to map it with their logins.
Power BI Licensing Cost:
Power BI proved to be cost-prohibitive for multiple users accessing the visualization, making it infeasible for this use case.
Solution
Data Integration
: We leveraged Dalgo to integrate data from multiple sources, including Avni and mGramSeva, streamlining data management.
Custom Connector
: Developed an in-house connector for mGramSeva, a unique feature that’s hard to find in other tools, enhancing our system’s versatility.
Unique URL Solution
: Addressed the multiple unique URL issue, which you can read more about [
here
], ensuring smoother navigation and access.
Scalable User Onboarding
: Using open-source versions of Superset allows us to onboard an unlimited number of users, with hosting on AWS as our only cost.
Superset Visualization
With the help of a unique URL an Anurakshak can see their activities.
Monitoring Pipeline
User can check the status of their data pipeline here
Sync is running on the daily basis for avni and weekly for mGramSeva and if something fails users can receive a discord notification and an email notification on the failures.
Data Quality Tests
We have written a few test cases which can identify data problems in your data. Like not null, unique columns, and type checks for the column.
If something fails with the test cases you’ll be notified by the yellow line which you can see above.
Conclusion
Keeping in mind the Arghyam strategy of leveraging the power of technology as an enabler and working on scale, we are trying to establish a sustainable PWS operation and maintenance model, which is amenable to govt and replicable and scalable through their system.
Integrated dashboard of both these digital tools Avni & mGramseva try to address quite critical aspects of PWS operation and management by ensuring trusted data generation through the participation of frontline workers which could be utilised to improve decision making to strengthen the system for better accountability and transparency. For the frontline, this dashboard helps them to understand their performance by looking at one single dashboard that is readily available, sharable and retrievable and is not prone to physical damage to be misplaced or lost which are the main challenges they face while maintaining physical records.Title: Janaagraha Collaboration Update

==================================================

Ashwin and Thomas have been engaged with Janaagraha as
fractional FCXOs
, focusing on shaping their tech strategy. Recently, we’ve extended this model to include a fractional tech team, as part of a broader experiment and I am part of that experiment.
About Janaagraha:
Janaagraha works to improve the quality of life in India’s cities and towns by collaborating with citizens and governments to enhance citizenship and infrastructure & services. More details can be found
here
.
My Visit to Janaagraha:
I was in Bangalore for the
Dalgo sprint
from August 16-20, collaborating with NGOs in the Dalgo ecosystem. During this time, Ashwin asked if I could meet with Janaagraha’s leadership, as he would be unavailable the following week. I visited Janaagraha on the last day of the sprint, where I met the leadership team and some of the tech team members.
I extended my stay the next week to get a better understanding of the tech team’s operations. Although Ashwin and Thomas were out of town, Ashwin had provided a detailed set of steps, shared with Haji, which helped me navigate independently.
Initial Insights:
The first day involved attending a tech webinar led by Guru, focused on the challenges faced by the development team. Key issues discussed included:
The shift from a product-driven approach with more control to a service-based model has limited decision-making flexibility for the tech team.
The influx of ad hoc requests from various program teams complicates prioritization.
The absence of a centralized platform to track what each team member is working on, leading to context-switching and inefficiencies.
Program teams frequently engage third-party vendors without involving the tech team, making it challenging to maintain or update work when context is missing.
Guru suggested several solutions:
Maintaining a project backlog sheet with clear task priorities.
Ensuring visibility into task priorities, allowing team members to manage their workloads and decline unnecessary tasks.
Establishing a process for involving the tech team when program teams work with third-party vendors.
This session offered valuable insight into the existing challenges and operational dynamics at Janaagraha.
Overview of Platforms:
Sudhakar provided an introduction to the platforms developed by Janaagraha, which was both impressive and inspiring. The pride in his voice was evident as he described their achievements. Notable applications include:
Swachhata
: A significant success during the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, with over 20 million users.
Public Eye
Ichangemycity
Variations of these applications for different states and partners.
The current primary focus is on the
City Finance
app, which addresses key issues related to data collection, consolidation, and verification. I took a keen interest in the tech side and requested access to the GitHub repositories. I set up the City Finance code locally and inquired about their testing processes, led by Christina. I spent four days in the office observing the tech team’s operations and identifying areas for improvement.
Observations and Recommendations:
I compiled my observations into a
document
, which I shared with Ashwin and Thomas. They were aligned with many of the points I raised. Here’s a summary:
Dev Team Management
:
Introduce a comprehensive tracking sheet to monitor each team member’s tasks.
Consider moving from ClickUp (paid) to GitHub Projects (free).
The current task tracking process is ad hoc and lacks a centralized platform for visibility.
Open Source Strategy
:
Open-source the City Finance project to leverage free tools and CI pipelines.
The project includes three repositories: Frontend (v1 on Angular 11 and v2) and Backend (Node Server).
The process involves using GitGuardian for security checks, updating licenses to AGPL 3.0, and implementing code quality checks in the CI pipeline.
UI Framework Upgrade
:
The current Angular v11 is outdated and poses security risks. Upgrading to Angular v15 is planned but requires careful testing due to breaking changes.
Automated Testing
:
There are currently no automated tests in place. We initiated basic Cypress test cases for login/logout and plan to expand testing post-upgrade to Angular v15.
Error Monitoring
:
No error monitoring system is in place yet. Discussions are planned for the coming weeks.
Additional Technical Concerns
:
Ensuring consistent features (like headers/footers) across app versions.
Addressing gaps in backend processes like seeds, migrations, and CI improvements.
Quick Wins and Next Steps:
To enhance the developer experience and upskill the team, Guru initiated weekly tech demo calls where the team can showcase their work and learn from each other. The first major task I prioritized was making the repositories open source. Open sourcing provides access to free tools, unlimited CI/CD pipelines, and external contributors.
Lobo has often emphasized that building for the public good should start with open source, although nonprofits often struggle to follow this practice. Fortunately, Janaagraha had already included this in their roadmap and had signed an MoU with this goal in mind.
After scanning the repositories with GitGuardian and collaborating with Jeeva and Kushal to address exposed keys, we added the AGPL 3.0 license and made the repositories public. This enabled us to integrate multiple code quality checks and testing into the CI pipeline. I implemented these in one of the repositories and demonstrated the results to the team.
Here are some specific improvements:
Deepscan
: Integrated to check code quality issues for every pull request. If you check the
Deepscan page
, it highlights some issues that can be addressed for better code quality.
Unit Testing with Codecov
: Added to monitor and report test coverage on each pull request. The
Codecov page
currently shows a coverage of around 8%, with plans to improve this across all City Finance repositories.
GitGuardian
: Integrated to prevent future key leaks. You can see the implemented checks in this
PR
, which sets up Deepscan, Codecov, and GitGuardian checks.
The next steps involve extending these practices to all City Finance repositories and continuously enhancing code quality.
Enhancing the Testing Process:
I created a separate repository for
Cypress
and added initial test cases. Abhishek is now leading this effort, focusing on expanding test cases for the homepage. We’ve also integrated Cypress Cloud to monitor test failures and provide video replays. The next step is integrating these tests into a GitHub workflow that runs daily or with every pull request.
Infrastructure Upgrades:
Ashwin and Thomas proposed infrastructure changes that were recently approved. I participated in calls to document and ensure that best practices were followed. Currently, the deployment architecture is straightforward, with everything (database, application server) hosted on a single EC2 instance. The proposed improvements include:
A separate 2-node database cluster.
A load balancer in front of the application server.
These changes are crucial for scalability and improving the overall reliability of Janaagraha’s infrastructure.
Moving Forward:
Thanks to Ashwin’s guidance, I’m now part of the broader tech strategy for Janaagraha, exploring collaborations with other partners. While some progress has been made, much work still lies ahead.Title: Janaagraha Fractional CTO Blog
Author: Ashwin Srinivasan
Date: July 2023
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/janaagraha-fractional-cto-blog/
==================================================

After a career in the commercial tech sector, I joined Tech4Dev in February 2023 as a fractional CTO.
From February, I started working with
Janaagraha
, an established and reputed organisation with the goal of transforming the quality of lives in Indian cities.
My broad brief was to:
Help with the running and operations of significant projects like
Swacchata – a product built by Janaagraha to support the governments Swacch Bharat (clean India) mission
cityfinance.in
– a platform looking to drive transparency in the financial data across municipalities in India
Advise and help implement a product and technical strategy
Capacity building for their key technical projects and tech teams
Impressions of Janaagraha
I was fortunate to join just as Janaagraha were having a company wide offsite in February. At this offsite, I was able to meet most of the 90+ Jana family and understand a bit about each of the programs and functional areas.
In addition to the enthusiasm, ambition and idealism you would expect in an NGO, I was tremendously impressed by the way Janaagraha has set itself up to sustain its culture as it grows, as well as the quality and diversity of people it has attracted.
I met committed Janaagraha team members who came from a variety of professional backgrounds including accounting, finance and investment banking, biotechnology researchers, aeronautical engineers, public policy experts, social scientists and community field workers. Collectively they have built up a tremendous level of domain expertise.
Janaagraha also thinks very broadly and for the long-term, applying system thinking to all its activities which range from public policy advocacy, urban planning, municipal finance reform, civic education and civic participation. They have many extremely committed team members who have a long tenure at the organisation.
Often, the team needs to operate in a very ambiguous socio-political environment and are heavily resource and capacity constrained. A lot of patience and resilience is required to work through these type of circumstances. In fact urgent patience is one of their culture codes reflecting the understanding that systemic change can take a lot of time, but there are moments when you need to seize your window of opportunity.
Technical Landscape
Janaagraha has a good internal tech team of approximately 8 members, many who have been with them for many years. The team has delivered and run a lot of significant nation-wide projects/products like Swacchata and I Change My City, as well as other projects for specific states like Odisha.
One of the primary strategic challenge arises from the tension between being a catalyst for system change as the organisation desires to be, and building and running systems effectively. Invariably, once one of your systems starts getting traction with the government and usage becomes broadbased such as was the case with Swacchata, you end up being swamped with feature requests and operational challenges. In Swacchatas case, it was handed over to be run by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in April 2023, but the endgame for other projects is often not clear.
Another significant challenge is the project based mindset of a lot of the work which arises due to funding pressures and the ambiguity of government support. It is natural to focus on the immediate brief and pursue the directly visible program objective or opportunity, but this often leads to people being spread very thin, sub-optimal systems, and no ongoing leverage of the work you have done (for instance, similar grievance redressal has been built into 3 different systems). One of the key changes that we are working through is the shift from a project to a product mindset. This is particularly relevant to the cityfinance project which emerged scrappily but is now demonstrating potential to be a hugely impactful system. For cityfinance, we are having to very carefully navigate short-term operational challenges, urgent program deadlines, while at the same time working towards a sustainable product and architectural vision.
From a capacity building perspective, the key challenge is the sourcing of the appropriate skills when senior level expertise is required. Like most NGOs, Janaagraha doesnt have the funding or appetite to build a large in-house technical team. So we need to carefully think about the balance between building core capabilities and system / domain expertise in-house and relying on external vendors to bolster capacity for specific projects and systems.
My Personal Reflections
From a personal perspective, this has been and continues to be an extremely rewarding engagement for me. I have learned and been exposed to many things that I wouldnt have been exposed to in the commercial tech sector.
Even from a tech perspective, I have a significantly broader scope of concerns relating to product, tech, organisation and ecosystem than I had earlier. It has been both interesting and challenging to be spread across so many things. Furthermore, due to the significantly reduced resourcing and capacity in comparison to a commercial set up, Ive been forced to embrace constraints more explicitly and creatively but judiciously work around them. On a few occasions, basic assumptions and opinions I had have been challenged and upended within the space of weeks and months. This has been both humbling and eye-opening.
Overall, having worked in the commercial tech sector for many years, it has been great to get out of the tech company bubble and see a different environment. Above all, the energy of the team, the values of the
Janaagraha
organisation, the guidance and support of the Tech4Dev community, and the potential scope and nature of impact provides a daily inspiration.Title: Joining Tech4Dev: My First Sprint Experience

==================================================

In August, I jumped into Tech4Dev—a place that blends tech with social impact. From day one, I felt the unique vibe here: small team, big energy, with each person bringing something special. When Radhika asked if anyone wanted to help organize the sprint, I was all in! I’ve always been curious about event management, and stepping into this role felt exciting and a little out of my comfort zone.
Planning the Sprint: Team Spirit at Its Best
Organizing the sprint was such a rewarding experience. From setting up meetings to planning hackathons and team activities, it was all about collaboration and mutual support 🤝. The whole team’s encouragement made me feel like part of the “tribe” from day one, and that sense of shared respect and fun made every moment memorable.
Meeting the Team: Breaking the Ice
Before the sprint, my interactions, like with Himanshu were strictly formal. But meeting in person changed everything! What started as serious chats quickly turned into laughter—especially when we joked about secretly using ChatGPT to polish our responses. It was the same with everyone: those “serious” profiles turned out to be warm, approachable people in person. 😊
Leaders with Heart
❤️
Seeing leaders like Erica, Lobo, and Vinod lead with such openness and humility was amazing. They reminded me of a team of wise mentors, like my own Hogwarts trio—with Erica as McGonagall, Lobo as Dumbledore, and Vinod as Lupin. Their warmth made me feel like part of something special.
Krishna and Radhika: My Support System
Krishna, my manager, has been such a pillar of support, blending structured guidance with informal after-hours chats that made me feel empowered. And Radhika’s open conversations created a comfortable space to share my thoughts and challenges—making me feel truly valued and understood.
Enriching Conversations and Local NGO Connections
The opening circle at Ward’s Lake and the “Ask Me Anything” session with leadership were so enriching. Leaders tackled tough questions with complete transparency, setting a powerful example for all of us 🌱. Connecting with local NGOs was another highlight; they shared their challenges and tech goals openly, reminding me of the impactful mission that drew me to Tech4Dev. It gave me insights into their journeys and a sense of purpose in the work we do.
The Sprint: Work, Laughter, and Connection
The sprint wasn’t just about work; it was a mix of laughter, friendly teasing, and bonding over shared experiences. My colleagues, especially Akhilesh, even gave me some good-natured ribbing 😆. Between work sessions, team dinners, and exploring the city, every part of the schedule was balanced perfectly. The food and accommodation were top-notch, thanks to Diana, Amit, Aishwarya, and everyone else involved.
Hackathon Highlights and New Bonds
During the hackathon, I was placed with the Dalgo team, where Shamoon and Ishan made me feel right at home. Though initially unsure about my contributions, their warmth and openness quickly put me at ease, valuing my input and creating a true sense of belonging. Our team even snagged second place! Throughout the week, we had enriching conversations that covered everything from politics and religion to personal journeys and the nuances of married life. My roommate, Abhishek, was incredibly thoughtful, and late-night and early-morning chats with everyone—Anto, Thomas, Gautam, Anandu, Krishna, Radhika, Sangeeta, Aishwarya, Amisha, Tejas, and Akansha—made the experience even more memorable.
Personal Goals and Realizations
One thing that struck me was everyone’s fitness level. I joked that I might need a ropeway on the next hike if I don’t shape up! Inspired, I made a few bets with teammates to work on my fitness 😅—gotta start somewhere, right?
Exploring Local Culture and Beyond
From market visits to late-night drinks, it was a whirlwind of fun and learning about the local culture. Conversations about certain projects, Dalgo and the Fractional CXO Program seamlessly flowed from work discussions to casual chats over coffee, dinner, and even late-night drinks, and exploring new ideas for projects. Despite the packed schedule, I felt refreshed, whether shopping, singing on bus rides, or stopping for photos. The closing night, filled with dancing and joy, was the perfect ending to an unforgettable week 💃🕺.Title: KEFs Data Story

==================================================

Written by Namratha and Naveen from Key Education Foundation
In 2017, Key Education Foundation embarked on a mission to enhance the quality of early childhood education for 1000 children across five schools. In these initial years, we focused our energy on streamlining the processes for monitoring activities within the program.
Fast forward 7 years, today we have 6 programs running across 8 states. With this expansion came the need for more robust data processes, not just for monitoring but for thorough evaluation as well. It was at this crucial juncture that the Data Catalyst Program gave us a clear vision for our data strategy.
Members from Tech4Dev, Goalkeep, Agency Fund and Dasra conducted a 2-day workshop in Kochi, to kickstart a 3 month data journey together. Before the workshop, we engaged with the organising teams in a month-long exercise to bring together our problem statements and narrow down our areas of development. The team helped us deep dive into our projects, breaking them down so as to identify the gaps in impact measurement. We were introduced to Data Culture Rubric and engaged in an exercise with the team at Goalkeep to assess KEFs position on it. This provided a clear picture of how far we have come in our data journey and how much further we still need to go. By the time we arrived in Kochi, we were ready to engage, learn and apply our learnings actively.
The two days of workshop were planned with a lot of care. The sessions were relevant, enabling several productive discussions, with enough breaks and opportunities for networking. One of the first sessions had us reflecting on the data culture in our organisation through a simulation exercise, which more or less set the tone for the coming months of engagement. It showed us what our journey towards a sophisticated data culture could look like. The remaining sessions that followed touched upon data in leadership, running experiments for data driven decision making and ways to leverage LLMs. These sessions were not only informative but also inspiring, providing us with fresh perspectives on how data could be harnessed to drive KEFs mission forward.
We have left the workshop with valuable resources and questions to ask ourselves as we set on this data journey. These will now serve as building blocks as we work to integrate our newfound learnings into all our programs.Title: Karjat Sprint Day 4 and my takeaways – By Ankit Saxena

==================================================

This was my 3rd Project Tech4dev sprint. This was setup along with the dasra folks at Karjat, near Mumbai. While it was hot, the resort was great with good facilities. And we had a good time interacting with each other, learning, sharing and just hanging out.
On day 4 we had a blast by playing indoor games within the team. We played musical chairs and heads-up games. Thanks to Shamoon for organizing the event.
Musical chairs was a great way to start the day (running and dancing). I was destined to win it but then Lobo, KP, and Sneha – they all ganged together (glific vs fcxo) and had me out. Anyways, the above pic is of Sneha who won the game and received a 5000$ award
The second game was heads up where a topic/ word will be chosen. Except for the person who is playing the question game, the rest of the players would know the word. Now, the player  will try to guess the word by asking questions to the remaining team. Team can answer yes/no. Was a lot of fun to see people guessing and making fun and some spreading confusion as well. One word that remains the highlight is
thook
(saliva).
After that we worked in smaller groups till afternoon. In the afternoon we made a presentation about project tech4dev and the different initiatives to the dasra team. That started with a very deep and insightful conversation with Lobo. While many may know this, I got to know for the first time that Lobo would wear free t-shirts so that he can donate the money that he saved !
His talk was followed by a presentation by Sneha, Piyali and Rohit on Glific, Avni, fCXO and DDP. After that we asked the dasra teams to think of an area where any of these tech4dev initiatives can fit or be leveraged. Good and thought provoking conversations, while we all tech4dev members helped each group to think through about this topic.
Finally towards the end of the day, the team started returning back to the base, starting with the Pune gang – myself, KP, Arun an Amit.
That�s me, Piyali, Arun, Akhilesh and Sidhdhant in the bar, enjoying the party. And how can I not mention the
chumma-chumma
dance that Siddhant did; it was the highlight of the party.
As it happens, each sprint has a different vibe, setup and also gives a different perspective to look at things. This sprint, for me as an individual and as a fractional cxo, was very enriching. While I reflect back and write this blog, I think it is important to list the key points that I take back –
We had a good conversation on the open source philosophy that we as tech4dev people believe in. And not just philosophy, how should one implement it in day to day work and projects (such as using github issues, docs, etc) was something that I take back as a  fcxo, reflect and then get my team to start using.
We had another good conversation on the open source licenses and a high level understanding of a few ones. I take back the learning and Tech4devs recommendation to use
OSI
approved licenses.
The importance of in-person conversations – this is something that virtual can never beat. I had a good time talking to different tech4dev members, understanding their perspective and learning from their experiences. While we as a team have adopted the hybrid working mode, I would definitely look forward to meeting team members in Pune once or twice a month.
The importance of informal and casual interactions, playing games, etc – this again we used to do in previous sprint, but this time I found a new meaning to it. I realized that I got to know a great deal about the people whom I work with. This definitely would help me to collaborate better and have difficult conversations, with slightly more ease.
The importance of being true to yourself and accepting that you dont know everything, asking for help/ guidance and support. Also, always open to the possibility of questioning your belief system. Ability to take critical feedback, process it and work upon it if necessary.
Another area that opened up for me is that especially for people who come from the corporate sector, knowledge is a personal power that can be used as a tool to control and career growth (by not sharing it and creating power circles). I dont believe in this consciously but I have seen this happening around me (and maybe in some point of my life I even did it). So sharing something with a wider group doesnt come naturally for people like me. We need to work actively on this and change this behavior.
Another beautiful aspect was that of appreciation. We live in a world where on a daily basis we are flooded with criticism and complaints coming on to us. And thats what we radiate back. But I realized that this is a vicious circle and we need to break it by actively nurturing a culture (both at work and family) to feel gratitude and express our thankfulness to people who even do a very small thing to make our day better.
Finally I am thankful to my colleagues – Lobo, Erica, Sneha, Siddhant, Rohit, Ishan, Akhilesh, Piyali, Abhishek, Rob, Shamoon, Arun, Amit, KP, Kurund (sorry if I missed someone) – who made my trip and stay a great and memorable one. Thanks everyone, you all rock!
PS – the 5000$ was a joke heheheheh ????Title: Karjat Sprint: Day 1

==================================================

The location of the April 2023 sprint is Karjat, a small humble town in the middle of Pune & Mumbai. Our team is staying at the
Radisson Blu Resort
situated in a valley surrounded by a picturesque view of the hills.
Before coming to the sprint, the Dev Data Platform team had set goals which broadly fell into these 3 categories – architectural discussions of the platform, engineering/development of important features and boilerplate of a working UI with the onboarding flow.
We started day 1 with a talk/session by Rohit, Head of Engineering at
Tech4dev
leading the DDP project. The agenda behind the session was to spread awareness about the platform in different verticals of Tech4dev namely Glific and fractional CxO. Rohit discussed the problems DDP is solving for NGOs and how we plan to leverage the open source tools in our platform. In a nutshell, DDP will help NGOs to ingest, clean and transform their data from multiple sources to a single warehouse for better analytics & visualization. If we think from a software engineering point of view, the product is more of an integration platform stitching all the open source tools with a nice looking UI that the organizations will use to build their pipelines.
I also got an opportunity to interact with Robert from
Agency Fund
. His focus is on Evidence based philanthropy using RCT (Randomized Controlled Trials). We had interesting conversations on some of the advantages/disadvantages of running RCTs, how we ended up in the NGO sector, our similar penchant for math & statistics and our tolerance towards spicy food. Robert has some good insights on the POCs we are doing with the current NGOs. He argued against the use of Dbt for transforming the data. R studio would be more apt for doing exploratory data analysis & to quickly see some statistics on the data like frequency count, averages, etc. These are crucial steps in the initial stages of data exploration.
After a lavish lunch, with an array of food items available, we started our development work to tackle the issues we had planned to solve. I took up the initiative of cleaning, refactoring and standardizing our code in terms of database fields, function names, api responses and payloads. It was a productive day not only in terms of development work but also in catching up with other team members.
The sprints have this very toxic rejuvenating energy that brings our team together as one and is also an important reminder of the impact we are/trying to create by doing what we do. I called it a night after dinner to have a fresh start on Day 2.Title: Karjat Sprint: Day 2

==================================================

It’s hard to believe how quickly time has passed, and it’s already time for another
Tech4dev
sprint. This time, we’ve chosen to hold it at the
Radisson Blu Resort
in Karjat. It is more of a team gathering without the participation of NGOs, still, we will see some new faces for the first time in person as the team is growing at a significant pace.
Read more about Day 1 of the sprint on Ishans
blog
For Day 2, we started the day around 9 with a talk by Deval, the founder of
Dasra
. He shared his inspiring journey with
Dasra
and amusing anecdotes about his experiences with Lobo as they have been working together in the social sector for more than two decades.
After that, we broke up into smaller groups namely DDP, Product and Sales, and Glific Developer for a two-hour work session. This allowed us to focus on our group goals and tasks for the sprint. It always feels great to work in person as it’s rare since most of us work remotely from different locations. We were able to quickly resolve a few issues during this session.
Next, we regrouped for a talk by Robert from
Agency Fund
, who shared about his work and how they make funding decisions based on evidence. This talk prompted us to reflect on our projects and how we should make decisions based on data points and metrics rather than the testimony of a few stakeholders.
After the talk, we had lunch and then continued tackling more issues from our list. Between the break and the work session, we managed to squeeze quick TT sessions(Yeah! Infamous TT table is back) before calling it a day at 7 PM.
After that, we made our way to the resort’s gaming area where we enjoyed a game of five-on-five bowling. It was a pleasant change of pace to spend time with everyone outside our work
Though our team lost(We won hearts), it was a fun experience. Kurund was the star performer of the match, and he kept boasting about it during dinner, which made the dinner conversation interesting.
Overall, it was a productive and enjoyable day for all of us.Title: Karjat Sprint: Day 3

We kicked off day three with an excellent talk from Swapneel from
Goalkeep
titled “Data Eats Code for Lunch”. It was an engaging presentation and discussion of the role of code in enabling data and how to arrive at those use cases for these data through a process of enquiry.
We had a number of follow up discussions focusing on these use cases and how to set expectations for what data can and cant do for orgs. We discovered that were kindred spirits in data literacy and culture change and had many lessons and learnings to share with each other. If
Data Eats Code for Lunch
, Data Use Cases eat both for breakfast.
The afternoon session was an open QA with
Tech4dev
‘s founders, Lobo and Arun, about anything and everything under the sun, from core values to open source licenses. It reminded me of the early days of Google when we would have direct and engaged access to its founders and set a core culture of accessibility and humility in leadership.
For me, the two sessions were interleaved with working on and fixing an
Indus Action
data problem with Ankit, strategizing on data culture change strategies with Swapneel, and a design discussion about data lakes and client-side javascript with Siddhant and the DDP team. We didnt just talk, we got things done.
It’s my third day as a Project
Tech4dev
sprint guest from the
Agency Fund
and Im full of thoughts and feelings that are slowly coming together. What I can say so far is that I’m very humbled and inspired by what everyone brings to the table every day of the week: purpose, drive, humility, curiosity, drive, enthusiasm, gratitude, intelligence, fun and collaboration – just to name a few. What Im realizing is Culture eats everything for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The
Tech4dev
team makes the 3x all-you-can-eat buffets look like nothing and Im left feeling full with inspiration.Title: Kenya, India June ’25 – Sprints, NGOs and Funders

==================================================

On a long long flight from Delhi to San Francisco, after another trip to Kenya and India, where we had lots of deep conversations with multiple NGOs, interacted with many of our software and data partners in the ecosystem and had conversations (and lots of questions) with many of our existing funders on where we are and the direction that we are headed in with Tech4Dev 3.0
Group photo of participants in the AI for Global Development cohort
At a broader level, we now have 44 folks at Tech4Dev, which also means we have many other contributors writing blog posts, so I don’t feel the need to write as often as I used to. But, I still think it’s useful for me to jot down some thoughts and reflections periodically. Without further ado, I’ll revert to my normal listicle style of things that I leave the trip with
Started the trip in Kenya with the AI for Global Development (AI4GD) that we help The Agency Fund with. This time, we decided to keep it focused on the 8 NGOs in the cohort, and that helped with the quality of the presentations, interactions and discussions on different challenges that the teams faced. Specifically, we got quite a few good ideas of things to add to our platform, including: automated phase 1 evals (as part of deployment), classification of incoming messages in a generic manner (supervised learning), and a co-pilot platform for the sector.
Prior to the sprint, we held a meetup for some mid-to-large NGOs in Nairobi to learn about some of their issues and challenges. Specifically, it was great to finally connect and have a good conversation with Ayan from Akvo and learn more about the work they are doing. It was also quite informative to learn more about the agriculture space and the work that Digital Green is doing from Vineet and Sai. Learned a lot about how things work in that field in India over a happy hour discussion (lack of mechanisation in smallholder farms in India, the work involved for farmers, water retention in crops due to genetic modification, which contributes to the pollution in North India and more)
We had planned a funder day for the first day of the sprint, but unfortunately, due to the unrest in Nairobi, a few participants could not make it. Had really good conversations with the funders who attended, especially an in-depth conversation on the role of technology and AI with NGOs with Tye from Emerson Collective. How can we approach the problem in a systematic way rather than the patchwork of solutions and bandaids that are deployed in the sector due to a lack of capacity and skills? Also had interesting conversations on the importance of funding experiments and giving NGOs the flexibility of allocating resources to some promising new things, without associating it with specific KPIs in the early days, e.g, I think its too early to say, we will only fund your AI experiments if you can show us the impact it will have for the grant we are giving you. Unfortunately, I don’t think we made any progress in convincing these two foundations that a flexible approach is also important in some cases.
Continued the conversation with funders and partners in India, especially with a focus on our
next 3-year
plan for Tech4Dev. I expected some push back or critique for parts of the plan, but in general, everyone felt that we were headed in the right direction without being too ambitious. Specifically, the feedback involved:
We need to start thinking a bit more about the measures of impact and ROI for the work we do. Are they proxies for the cost savings or efficiencies that are gained by NGOs using technology, or the systemic impact on an NGO with our fCxO program? What indicators can we use to get a sense of this? Vinod and I had long conversations and arguments on what impact (if any?!!) the fCxO program is creating long-term change in the NGOs. My personal view (Vinod can write his own post if he wants his view known), is that this is a mid-long term change that is happening and will happen, and while we cannot see it very starkly, I do believe that there is a significant impact over time of this work
People were a bit concerned about the proposed work with the government. While we do believe it is important to ensure our systems get deployed and work at scale, we plan to do this via our NGO and funder partners and not directly. An interesting conversation with Vaishali (from Veddis foundation) was on how we can ensure that the program continues and is deeply embedded within the government ecosystem for a long time, rather than disappearing when the NGO and we transition out. There are not too many successful examples of this happening currently, but lots of NGOs are trying it, and we probably should collaborate to share learning, approaches and maybe even vendors.
People were excited about our AI Cohort and how we are developing the AI platform. Most funders now just get it and are in total agreement with building for the sector rather than with the NGO
We also had a few long meetings with 3 amazing NGOs: Educate Girls, Magic Bus and Jai Vakeel Foundation. EG and MB are amongst the largest NGOs in India, so it was really good to see what they are focusing on, some of their pain points and more importantly, how we could work with them so we can help them and also incorporate the learnings into our platforms, so others can benefit. The amount of innovation at the tech and AI level that Jayant R (CEO of MB) is driving with MB is mind-blowing, and we can away from that meeting with a sense of awe. Our goal is to get more NGOs to think and act that way from an innovation and iteration perspective
One final thought, in a weird way (aka murphy’s law), in 4 different conversations, the topic of bringing a few leaders (and their CTOs if there is one) to talk all things tech, data and AI and discuss common areas of interest, pain points, approaches for funding and more. Highly likely we will take action on this and have an event sometime in the next couple of months.Title: Khopoli Sprint: Team Activities, and Wins

==================================================

It took me almost more than 4 years of building up the courage to finally write something straight from the heart. Yes, you read that right.
No one ever held me back. In fact, I was constantly cheered on and encouraged to follow my passion. Writing has always been close to my heart. I was that teen who filled notebooks with stories, poems, and random thoughts (and let’s be honest, I still feel like that teenager at heart. Somewhere along the way, life got busy, and I lost touch with that creative spark. But this team sprint in Khopoli  it’s been different. It brought a wave of self-reflection, a touch of nostalgia, and most importantly a nudge to reconnect with the writer in me.
Let’s dive deeper into what happened and how it all went to get a better picture.
Bias session that sparked reflection
We had an online session on unmasking unconscious bias by
Sama
in the month of April, and during the team sprint in Khopoli, we continued with an in-person session – part two of the online session. This time, it felt different. Being surrounded by the entire team brought a more personal touch to the experience.
We started with a
Human Bingo
game, an unexpected way to break the ice and get to know each other. The game was simple, find people who match the statements on the paper and write their name. One of the statements in the Bingo game was: A team member who doesn’t speak up during meetings despite having some points to share. A few teammates  came to me asking about it, and wrote my name on the statement box and I replied, ‘No, that’s not me. But later, I found myself reflecting on why it came across that way to my teammates. It made me think whether I sometimes hold back my thoughts in group settings. I used to feel that it’s completely okay not to speak up if there’s nothing meaningful to add. However, the murmuring in the room made me pause and think again and again. It gave me a subtle nudge, and I realized that I need to be more open and expressive in group settings instead of holding myself back.
Still I had hesitation, my mind had multiple thoughts, should I grab this opportunity to speak up or let it go. But my inner voice was speaking to me and giving me a familiar doha that  instantly came to my mind:
“Kaal Kare So Aaj Kar,
Aaj Kare So Ab,
Pal Mein Pralaya Hoyegi,
Bahuri Karoge Kab.”
It was a sudden push, I wanted to take that chance. I kept talking to myself in my mind.
This is just our internal team, and if I can’t speak here, how will I represent on bigger stages like NGO events, accelerators, or city meetups? I have always dreamed of leading sessions and going global, representing. It’s time to stop overthinking, trust your heart, and give it a shot.
AAL IZZ  WELL!
Team activities and realizations
Team Activity 1: Case Study Discussions
The first exercise brought us into action with different case studies. Each group was given a unique case study to discuss, analyze, and summarize. We were divided into teams, with each group working on real-life scenarios (case studies). This hands-on approach encouraged quick thinking and teamwork to present our collective insights.
Team Activity 2: Discussing respectful and disrespectful behaviors
For the second activity, we were reshuffled into new teams, allowing us to work with different members. This time, we discussed common respectful and disrespectful behaviors in various contexts, including:
Communication
Physical Space & Personal Boundaries
Giving and Receiving Feedback
Online Interactions
These discussions helped us gain insights into how behaviors can impact collaboration and the importance of maintaining respect in diverse settings.
I represented my team on both the activities, articulating our discussions despite having my initial fears of stumbling or not being able to express myself well. Overcoming this fear of public speaking was a significant achievement, as I had always worried about not meeting my team’s expectations or fumbling through the presentation. After the activities many of my teammates came up to me and appreciated me for speaking up and sharing my thoughts—it made me feel on top of the world that day.
Team Activity 3: Move to Your Opinion
The last activity, the most energetic part, was when we had to move physically to designated spots—’Agree,’ ‘Strongly Agree,’ or ‘Disagree’—based on statements given to us.
A simple activity, but it led to some intense discussions and reflections.
Key Takeaways
This sprint at Khopoli wasn’t just a series of activities, it was a journey of self-discovery. Stepping up to represent my team, despite my fears of public speaking, was a big milestone. I realized that courage doesn’t mean not being afraid—it means pushing through despite the fear. The discussions around biases made me think about my own assumptions and how easily they can shape my perspective without me even realizing it. It’s a reminder to be more mindful and intentional in my interactions, both personally and professionally
The activities, especially the one about respectful and disrespectful behaviors, made me more aware of how small actions can impact collaboration. For example, it was impressive to see that people at different levels of the organization, including seniors, shared the same mindset. They were actively listening, giving me and other team members space to speak without interrupting or dismissing our input.
Lastly I would say it’s never too late to pick up something you love.
Shoutout
A huge shout out to the team

==================================================

Just eight months after our first cohort completed the program, the Data Catalyst Program(DCP) is back with its second cohort of 10 nonprofits who are on a mission to level-up their data game.
If you’re curious to know how it all started then read this
blog by Lobo
.
Check out
this one-pager
that summarizes outcomes and learnings from our first cohort, which fed into the design and implementation for the second cohort.
All-in-all DCP aims to help nonprofits level-up on their data journey by identifying a key data-problem that the NGO is trying to solve and helping them solve it with the help of 1:1 mentorship, one-to-many expert led sessions on related themes, and cohort-based learning with other NGOs. This is done over 5 months, with two in-person modules.
In this second cohort, NGOs were required to make a contribution to cover 20% of program-participant costs so as to encourage accountability at their end and build sustainability into the program at our end. We were happy to see that the number of applications matched cohort 1. Moreover, we saw stronger applications this year! Perhaps in-part, due to the specificity of the revised application form.
Getting to know each other with a spin on Bingo facilitated by Goalkeep
Our
final cohort for DCP2
comprised 10 nonprofits (
Antarang Foundation
,
Avanti Fellows
,
Caring With Colour
,
Digital Green
,
Dream a Dream
,
Farmers for Forests
,
Fortify Health
,
Medha
,
Saturday Art Class
,
Shujaaz Inc
), with two participants per NGO, one implementer and one leader, this way, we could get our hands dirty and crack down on data issues with the implementer while ensuring that the work is relevant to the org and effectively adopted with the leader.
Half the organizations in the second cohort work in education, while the remaining half span climate, health, livelihood, and youth empowerment. DCP went international this year, with Shujaaz from Nairobi joining us alongside NGOs from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Karnataka.
Our cohort comprised of relatively mature/maturing organizations that were ready to level up their data game; with 9/10 of organizations having an annual budget of over 5Cr, 6/10 of the cohort having committed 10-25% of their budget to tech&data and 8/10 organisations having more than 5 team members dedicated to data work.
This time we ensured that most of the thinking work was front-loaded in the program. With all NGOs giving their
data maturity assessment
, discussing it with their mentors and aligning on their problem statement and scope of work before meeting in-person. This aimed to enable the participants to make the best use of their in-person work-time with their mentors in solving the problem.
Based on our learnings from last time, we structured the first in-person module to have 50% of time focusing on sessions on key themes of interest and 50% of time for working sessions with mentors. Goalkeep started us off with a memorable exercise for all the organisations in the room to get to know each other. This was tremendously successful and a great use of time, I think it will become a standard practice for future cohorts and programs. Over the two days we covered the what, why and how of visualisation, automated data pipelines, AI for data insights (
Jerome’s blog
), and an excellent panel session on ‘building a data-led organisation’ facilitated by
Deval
, cofounder
Dasra
.
Find the module’s
agenda
here and the session resources
here
.
We had opened up a an informal and optional space for nonprofits to dive deep into their work with their peers towards the end of the day. This saw interest on Day 1, but not on Day 2, which was a bit disappointing. Looking forward to revising this so that it becomes more effective.
All the planned sessions and worktimes have averaged a feedback of over a 4/5 . One major learning is to incorporate time for folks to put their learning to work during the session itself.
From a program lense this DCP module was smooth sailing, really happy with how we’ve optimized time and effort towards planning and executing this. It felt like things were on autopilot during the two days!
I am looking forward to the next couple of months to see how our nonprofits and mentors progress on their scope of work for the program and to spending more time with everyone in person at the next module!
A big shout out to everyone who helped make this cohort a tremendous success, programs team, mentors, session facilitators, and NGOs. Look forward to more blogs from
Goalkeep

Dasra
,
Tech4Dev
, and our participating NGOs on the sessions and their experience.

==================================================

Were in Kochi! And in just a days time well kick off the
Data Catalyst Program
(DCP) in-person with 30 data leaders across the 12 NGOs that comprise our first cohort.
In case you missed Lobos blog introducing the program give it a read
here
.
The collaboration with
Dasra
,
Goalkeep
,
The Agency Fund
and our NGOs leading up to this day has been an enriching experience and a great example of the kind of co-creation, open knowledge sharing, and cross learning that makes our ecosystem thrive.
As we conceptualised the program and its structure we had a few long discussions with the Dasra team about the selection process and ideal profile for our first cohort. The broad aim for the program is to help NGOs see tangible progress across one or more domains of data spanning leadership, strategy, culture, technology, and process.
While each NGOs aims would vary based on contextual challenges and their stage in their data journey, a simple prerequisite for this first cohort was for NGOs to already be on the path towards data driven decision making. The DCP teams expertise and cohort-learning opportunity could then serve as a catalyst towards their progress.
Some of the key criteria during application reviews were as follows:
Duration and extent of digital data collection.
Team size dedicated to working on data and tech.
Annual budget and percentage dedicated to data/related resources.
Clarity around data challenges/goals that theyd like to focus on.
Program participation from members relevant to the organisations focus areas.
Investment (preferably participation) from org leadership in making positive changes towards data informed decision making.
After internal review and a few follow up discussions with some of our applicants, we had our final cohort of 12 NGOs;
India Literacy Project
,
Ummeed Child Development Center
,
Key Education Foundation
,
The Apprentice Project
,
Dost Education
,
Saajha
,
Quest Alliance
,
Educate Girls
,
Uninhibited
,
SNEHA
,
One Billion Literates Foundation
,
Seven Sisters Development Assistance
.
We then needed to fine-tune our plans to meet the needs of our cohort. We did this by adopting two approaches in parallel. On the one hand we dived deep into the organisations’ data culture with Goalkeeps Data Culture Rubric conversations, and on the other we engaged in Deep Dive conversations with each NGO to understand their challenges, goals, and current state from a technical perspective. Find summaries
here
and
here
.
As a result of these pre-engagements we were able to fine tune our plans and assign relevant teams to our NGOs. These teams will drive progress in collaboration with their respective NGOs over the next 3 months.
As a final step, the assigned teams had a
prep call
with their NGOs in the week leading up to Kochi so as to address questions of data security, privacy, access, dive a little deeper into their goals for the Data Catalyst Program, and ensure that were able to do our homework by getting a look at their data and related collateral before we meet them in person.
Now youre all caught up! Look forward to more blogs and fresh perspectives from Dasra, Goalkeep, Agency Fund, and our NGO cohort in the weeks to come!

==================================================

Birth of a Collaboration
Hey, were doing the same thing here!
It all started for us when an unassuming reach out for advice about our program to Donald Lobo turned into a conversation where we realized there was a lot in common that we could do something together here.
I learnt from Lobo that Tech4Dev has a strong intent towards encouraging young women to join technology companies working in the social sector and they were already working with
ColoredCow
to start a pilot program. On the other hand, we started
HyperVerge Academy
(HVA) in March 2020 with an intent to enable young people from disadvantaged, under-represented and under-resourced backgrounds to learn software development and secure well paying jobs in the tech industry, and were looking for advice to grow our program.
Sensing the synergies, we joined hands to set up a fellowship program together, that aims to encourage more women to join/remain in technology positions and normalize the gender ratio in the technology sector (more specifically technology in the social sector) called Women in Tech Fellowship (WIT).
Setting the Stage
How do we get this started?
At HVA, we enabled 20 learners to get placed in technology jobs by creating an environment of self and peer learning guided by a technical mentor and a power skills
1
mentor. The 6 month fellowship is designed to be experiential in nature, where we mimic a real life work environment – learners are given tasks to build web applications while they learn the technologies in that process.
We decided to replicate this process and start a pilot for WIT by sourcing candidates from colleges near Tech4Dev partners. Our first partner, ColoredCow, invited students from
THDC Institute of Hydropower Engineering and Technology
in Tehri, Uttarakhand to join the program. Team members from ColoredCow would be playing the roles of technical mentors, who would spend about 30 min a day with the fellows to guide them. HVA would source the power skills mentors and also facilitate the entire fellowship. We would conduct reviews once in every 2 weeks to periodically evaluate whether the learners are on track.
ColoredCow then conducted an interactive awareness session in their office in Tehri for the students from THDC-IHET to explain more details about the program and peak their interest.
Interviews
Do you have what it takes?
Following the session conducted by ColoredCow, we got an amazing response from the students and had 26 young women apply to the program ranging from 1st to 4th year students. We had a range of students – from those looking to hone their skills and secure a job, to those looking to pick up and learn coding almost from scratch.
Our interview process consisted of 2 parts – a Reasoning check and a Motivation check. In the reasoning round, we share 1 or 2 simple problems to check for their comprehension, logical thinking and understanding abilities. In the second round, we spend time understanding the candidate as a person, asking them questions about their story, the accomplishments they are proud of, their aspirations and motivations, to check whether they would be a good fit for our program. We had 6 people from HVA and ColoredCow each conducting 5-6 interviews a day for a week.
My personal experience of conducting these interviews was nothing short of inspiring. I got the opportunity to speak to young women extremely high on motivation, and strong aspirations who just needed the right exposure and environment to thrive. One of the candidates spoke about how she never had the opportunity to learn computer programming in her school since there was no access to good teachers and was learning C++ on her own through a YouTube channel. Another candidate spoke about her dream of becoming an IT Officer in the Navy to also overcome her hydrophobia.
Selection
Who makes the cut?
While conducting the interviews, we used the following rubric to come up with an objective weighted average score for each candidate. Using the score as an indicator, HVA and CC teams got together and shortlisted a total of 21 young women – split across 4 batches. Each batch was allotted a technical mentor from CC, and a power skills mentor sourced by HVA. We then aligned on the curriculum, learning outcomes expected out of the fellowship, ways of measuring progress and were all set to go!
Day 1 – Orientation
Are you ready for it?
Exactly 2 months after my first call with Lobo about HVA (which was on 7th December 2021), we kickstarted the WIT fellowship with our first 4 batches from Tehri at 11AM on 7th February 2022. In my limited experience, this was one of the quickest and smoothest paths to actioning on an idea of collaboration, thanks to all the stakeholders involved – Tech4Dev, ColoredCow and our team at HVA.
The orientation was an interactive session with fun icebreakers to get started. Everyone shared their thoughts and aligned on the expectations we have set throughout the fellowship, our learning philosophy and the values we expect all stakeholders to uphold.
Shaivya facilitated the session, posing questions such as – What do you think would make the worst mentor? and got interesting answers such as Someone who doesnt understand or listen to the problems faced by a learner and also, Someone who doesnt laugh, setting the tone for the fellowship as a space of learning while having fun at the same time!
First Week of the Fellowship
�Kadam, kadam, badhaye ja�

After the energetic orientation session, all learners and mentors were informed of their groups and added to their respective Slack channels. Every batch meets on a daily basis for 20-30 mins to share their progress and seek help from the mentor to unblock them if they are facing any issues.�Each batch had a session where they set their own SMART goals for the duration of the 6 month fellowship. Every batch also spent time getting to know each other better as companions in their journey towards achieving these goals. The batches also started taking their first steps towards their goal by setting up a GitHub profile, and even some of them writing their first Python program.
We are off to a great start, and were confident of a successful completion of this program. We are looking forward to getting more and more young people (women and other underrepresented backgrounds) to secure a better future for themselves and create a more diverse, and equitable space in the technology industry.
Bonus – Blog Articles from our Fellows!

==================================================

Day 3 of the sprint (Day 1 for me)
I got into Kochi airport early Wednesday morning and crossed the street to get to the hotel (would you believe Uber was quoting over
?
600 for this ride?). I wouldn’t get my own room until 11am, but my team was so organised they had the hotel people assign me a temporary room. My temporary roommates were very gracious about being woken up at 6:30am but I quickly brushed my teeth and left so they could go back to sleep.
After breakfast and happy reunions we got into Day 2 of the
Data Catalyst Program
. I finally met Bhanu and Anil from
ILP
, and then Prashast and Chello from
Saajha
. Thomas and I had a good working session with Chello on the first steps for their Data Catalyst journey. The session was wrapped up beautifully by Kavneet from Dasra who polled the audience on how they felt and what they had learned, and then summarised the workshop for everyone. (Btw, you don’t know workshop summarising is a skill until you see someone do it as masterfully and effortlessly as she did).
We closed the day with an excellent evening of food drinks and karaoke… of which I unfortunately don’t have photographs. It was a lot of fun.
Day 4
The next day started bright and early. I resisted the social pressure to go on a 6:30 walk and instead spent the hour in the hotel gym. After a huge breakfast we started work – AN was
panicking
concerned that we might not hit our goals for the week so we made some lists to make him feel better. Then we had “prioritising meetings” where we decided what we were going to work on / not work on over the next couple of months. These turned out to be quick because I think we were all mostly aligned and just needed to say it out loud and write it down. Humans are funny creatures.
At tea-time Robert showed us two data tools his team has been exploring. The first was a minimal wrapper around a command-line tool, and the second was a full-blown IDE + app development suite. It’s always helpful to see how other products approach the UX problems we encounter with Dalgo, even if we don’t always have the same user profile as they do.
My roommate was Anand from
TAP
, and we chatted that night while he was working and I was trying to go to sleep. He told me he had been talking to someone-about-something, and that this person was “quite old”. I asked how old and Anand said “Oh, not as old as you!” Aaaaaaaa ???????????????????????? … anyway the conversation was long, varied and deep and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Day 5
Team meeting at 8am! The sprints are our only opportunities for open discussions with the entire team. We talked about what we like about our work culture and what could be tweaked, and we talked about things we do well and things we can improve on. There were no big surprises but we did decide (were told?) that from the next sprint every team will present an update of their work to the larger group.
After breakfast we did a deep dive into Dalgo with Ashwini, and talked about product features as well as plans for consulting. She gave us a demo of PowerBI and we used this to plan our Dalgo transformations UI.
Dalgo transformations UI
Nair and I talked through how to provide trial accounts for the platform, and while the plan looks good we’re going to wait until the UI transformations piece is ready before rolling this out.
At tea-time we (fCxO, Glific, Dalgo, Legal) had an important meeting on the implications of the new Data Privacy Act on us, our partners and our products. We had started these conversations last month but needed to bring them together and then plan how to proceed… now we have the beginnings of a plan but probably need another couple of weeks to start actually moving on it.
After this the Dalgo team completed the upgrade of Prefect and dbt which we had started a few days ago – all our tests passed, all data matched the pre-upgrade versions, and quite honestly we were rather pleased with ourselves. Neither upgrade was “hard” but we made sure to do them carefully. And it gave us a chance to use our new database diff script.
Day 6
Ok, the sprint is officially over but I’m still here. I had a productive morning doing accounts, attending to emails, saying goodbye to people, fixing a small bug, and updating the Dalgo weekly digest in Notion. Then I turned to my big task for the day – testing a rather major change to a
repository I don’t manage
(or even work on!), on the one day that the owners said they wouldn’t be messing around with it. But as soon as I got started, AN said he was ready to leave for Fort Kochi to get lunch… and of course I had to go.
See, I hadn’t had any meals out so far, and although I have no complaints about the food at the hotel it is still food at a hotel. And I’m leaving tomorrow and then I’ll go back to Bangalore and order from Kerala Pavillion or wherever and be filled with regret.
(Sorry Kerala Pavillion).
So we got into a taxi and then I found out that the ride to Fort Kochi is ONE AND A HALF HOURS LONG ugh and I hadn’t brought my computer. This was going to be a long day…
But it turned out to be worth it. Ishan joined us and the three of us sat at a river-facing restaurant and had an extremely satisfying filling and fulfilling meal. The place was full but not crowded, conversation flowed easily, the weather was lovely, and by the time the food came we were ready for it.
It seems like every sprint keeps getting better doesn’t it? I’m very glad to be here.Title: Lakeer Project Update  June 2019
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/lakeer-project-update-june-2019/
==================================================

The
past three months have been immensely productive for us at
Lakeer
.
Thanks to Soft Corner for developing with us our products, and
to
Tech4Dev
for
the immense support and frequent follow-ups. Here?s a quick update
on what we have been up to:
Product
1- QGIS plug-in for CitySight:
Soft
	Corner has
	closely worked with us and developed a QGIS plug-in for us which is
	currently connected to our CitySight?s staging database and loads
	all the layers on the platform on to QGIS. The user of the plugin,
	with authorized credentials, can connect to CitySight?s database
	and look at all the available datasets on the CitySight?s
	platform, select the desired layers and load them on QGIS. This
	enables users to utilize QGIS? functionalities in CitySight.
Amar
	and team are working on the second part of the plug-in which will
	allow the user to not just download layers from the database, but
	also push analyses results from QGIS to the CitySight platform and
	also specify the category and service (the hierarchical location of
	the dataset) for such dataset while doing so. This plugin will help
	us reduce the high costs of uploading individual datasets on to the
	server.
Product
2- City-Reporter:
Soft
	Corner and Lakeer have built the first version of our City-Reporter
	tool. The tool helps to report data stories for urban issues like
	public transport, housing, climate change, etc. City-reporter so far
	can:
Help
	build basic data stories on urban issues. Each story built on the
	platform will consist of multiple sections in the form of text,
	interactive map, media, embedded content, or a combination of any
	two of these.
CityReporter
	allows users to pull specific analyses made on CitySight to augment
	the data stories they are building. This helps tell a story
	spatially across the city.
The
	stories created can be shared on social media platforms of LinkedIn,
	Facebook, and Twitter. This helps readers to share the stories with
	the larger citizenry.
The
	platform also allows a comments section at the end of each story,
	the comments in which can be later approved by the admin.
We
	had a user training session with Soft-Corner where they trained our
	team on working with all the features of the reporting tool.
The
	reporter tool has been deployed on the server and we are working on
	building more test stories on the platform.
Pradnya
and the entire Soft Corner team have been immensely supportive
throughout the development process and have closely interacted with
us and made this progress possible.
This
week is very crucial for us as Soft Corner would be handing us over
the city-reporter tool. We are still working on some minor changes
and testing all the features.

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/lakeer-tech4dev-update/
==================================================

In November 2018,
Lakeer Foundation
was
selected
as one of the winners of technology development support from Project
Tech4dev
, an initiative of Chintu Gudiya Foundation. We are part of a group of 8 Indian NGOs selected out of 81 applicants by the Tech4dev project which works with Indian NGOs to enhance the implementation of their programs through strong data collection, analysis, and visualizations tools. It is led by tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Donald Lobo and software solution providers
Web Access
,
Samanvay Foundation
, and
Soft Corner
.
As one of India?s fastest growing technology non-profits, we see technology as a strong amplifier of good governance. We are focused on improving the quality of life in urban India through building open-source decision support systems for administrators. We work with multiple city administrators including city leaders in the municipality, waterworks & sanitation department, public transport authorities, and others. We help them understand what quality of life challenges citizens are facing and help them think through ways in which their limited budgets can be prioritized to solve these.
This is made possible by our open source geospatial data platform CitySight which allows city administrators to:
IDENTIFY priority action areas across 42+ quality of life and governance indicators
ANALYSE the current state of each indicator in the city in comparison to global benchmarks, and discover root causes of challenges
PRIORITIZE indicators to act upon on basis of urgency, feasibility, visible impact and long-term impact
SOLVE by increasing intra-department collaboration and working off global benchmark solutions and best cases
REPORT verified success stories using data & maps in accordance with central government schemes and benchmarks
We applied to Tech4Dev last year with the intention of building an open-source storytelling tool that will allow us to share the insights from our data & GIS analytics more widely with government leaders, civil society, and media. Here?s what we described our target product as in our application –
?We need help incorporating an open source map-based storytelling tool into our platform CitySight. While administrators have access to CitySight?s Identify and Analyse features we have not built out the ?Report? tool yet. As a result, our work on problem identification and the government?s response by finding solutions remains cut-off from broader citizen participation. To overcome this challenge, we want to explore building web-based reports combining text, video, images, charts, and embedded maps that can be archived on the platform and be accessible to all users (and to citizens) on every challenge reported and actions taken.?
Tech4Dev has assigned Soft Corner to work with us for a period of 6 months in helping us build this reporting tool so that we can share our work with the government and public in a powerful way. We?re really excited because the Soft Corner team has done some great GIS work with
Shelter Associates
, which is a sanitation-focused NGO in Pune, and we have the opportunity to learn from their experiences.
Through December we had two detailed calls with the Soft Corner team during which we explained our work and our major technical challenges. On 25th January, we had the first formal partnership meeting with Tech4Dev team at Lakeer?s Office in Hyderabad. It was a very productive meeting where we exchanged notes about each other?s work and outlined what we wanted to build together. In the spirit of the open source movement, we decided to share everything that was discussed at this meeting with the broader community and also get ideas/feedback from others!
Based on this conversation, Soft Corner is going to look into scoping out 2 pieces of technology support for us –
Build a mechanism for us to push outputs from QGIS desktop analytics directly to our open-source GIS visualization tool CitySight:
Amar is looking into options such as the QGIS cloud (which is a bit expensive) as well as a custom QGIS plug-in (which would be cheaper)
This technology would be helpful for other NGOs such as Shelter Associates, DataMeet etc. who rely on the free QGIS desktop software for analytics.
At this point, we are unsure if there is sufficient budget in the tech4dev grant to support this work so we will have to wait to hear and will update everyone through a blog post
Build a reporting tool that would allow us to publish data-driven and map-based stories explaining urban issues and involve citizens more closely in governance.
Pradnya built a great early prototype to get our thoughts on what this reporting tool might look like.
When we initially shared our ideas with Soft Corner team we were thinking of building individual reports for every issue, however, the team is now encouraging us to instead think of having a microsite for every city we work in???and publish stories on issues from the microsite.
This is a really interesting idea, and this week the Lakeer team will brainstorm further on this along with some of our champion users from the government and take a decision. If
you have ideas please share them in comments
The basic functionalities we discussed for the reporting tool are: (i) Segmenting a one-page microsite into multiple vertical panels, (ii) Ability to add titles, subtitles, pictures, and videos to each panel, (iii) Ability to pull a map from a database and embed it with custom styling in the report. This way the map can be continually updated based on changes pushed to the server either automatically or manually, (iv) Visualisation of time-series data to report changes happening in a city over a period of time, (v) While the reporting would be a vertical story, provisions for horizontal scrolls would be provided to show time-series data, graphs etc, (vi) Comments section (which would be moderated) at the end with an option to share the report, (vii) Making the reporting tool mobile compatible, and (viii) Build in flexibility for the tool to be multilingual though we will not build this feature right now
.
As suggested by Arun, Lakeer and Tech4Dev will put in place the following project management practices –
We will be have weekly calls and monthly in-person meetings. Next meeting is planned in February at the Soft Corner office.
We will build the target tools in monthly sprints with work distributed as follows:
2 weeks of development
1 week of testing and quality control (QC)
1 week to move from staging to the production server and test with real users
We wanted to use free project management tools to keep costs low and decided on Slack & Trello
On the whole, the meeting gave a sense of direction on how we would grow together. The next step is to freeze on the scope of work and get started. Stay tuned for further updates.
Finally, a big big thank you to Tech4dev for selecting us! We?re grateful that you saw merit in our application???early validation of this sort in year 1 of our journey means so much to us. We can imagine how much work has gone into setting-up and managing this entire process. Thank you for your energy, thoughtfulness, and vision to do this. We hope more philanthropic supporters will be inspired to work with tech non-profits as a result of Tech4Dev!

LakeerTitle: Launching Dalgo
Author: Abhishek Nair
Date: October 2023
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/launching-dalgo/
==================================================

In September 2023 we launched v.1.0 of
Dalgo
(formerly DDP), our open-source data platform for social impact.
Vinod had floated the idea for Dalgo through his early experiences in our Fractional CxO engagements and the idea took off with help and advice from our community.
Nonprofits face significant challenges with their data pipelines, the most common of which were that data was collected and stored in silos (Survey CTO, Kobo, Google Sheets, MYSQL) and that NGOs spent significant and repeated manual time and effort trying to consolidate this data for external and internal M&E. They also faced data pipeline breakages and were unable to find an affordable and contextually relevant solution that would help them solve this.
Read one of our first blogs from way back in August 2022, when the idea was conceptualised,
here
. Catch the entire Dalgo journey (via blogs)
here
.
Fast forwarding through the year, we validated the use of the platform and learned from proof of concept projects with Dost Education, SNEHA, STiR education, SHRI, and Antarang . Its during this time (around June, 2023) that I joined as the product manager for Dalgo (then referred to as DDP). It was super exciting to get to work on this new product just as it was getting ready to launch, there was a lot to catch up on and a lot that needed to be done. Bringing a product manager into what was a team of engineers for the longest time meant significant change. Super thankful to all the help from the
Dalgo team
in bringing me up to speed and helping move things along.
A key milestone that enabled progress was the
Sprint in Udaipur
where we spent a lot of time planning and setting internal processes to ensure we advance into a smooth launch. We also saw some minor confusion around v0.1. vs v1.0. culminate into clarity. Glad we got that cleared up.
We also spent time in Udaipur fielding names for the platform with the Tech4Dev team. Our platform would’ve likely been named Kaapi (only because we love our coffee) had it made it through trademark checks. Dalgo was our second contender. Dalgo meaning Data from Alpha to Omega, or Data and Algorithm, or short for Dalgona coffee, or a tribute to Star Wars, take your pick!
The facetime and conversations during the sprint helped a ton. Between mid-July and September we started to knock things off super efficiently every week. Learning (and relearning) the simple but valuable lesson of prioritisation and execution. We set up a
website
(thanks to
Think201
and
Prod
), built out the
platform for users
, began to close out our proof of concept projects and started onboarding them onto the platform while simultaneously picking up a few new projects. We also started telling people about Dalgo.
Edzolas Social Impact Circle
events and the
OASIS summit
were great platforms for us to share our work.
We had our
webinar
introducing Dalgo
to the social impact community on September 21st 2023. It was a great turnout with a good mix of folks across nonprofits, tech partners, and funders. Were looking forward to doing more webinars like this in the coming months where youll learn about how Dalgo has helped some of our early adopters and where we’ll show you some cool new features were coming up which will really round out the product to address other popular challenges of visualisation, data quality, governance, AI/ML, and  data exploration.
We couldnt have gotten here without support from the entire
Tech4Dev team

Agency Fund
,
Goalkeep

and all our ecosystem partners. Were working hard to make your data more and more accessible to you and your stakeholders so that you can leverage it for decision making with ease. Let us know what you think and what you need!Title: Launching the AI Cohort Program – Learnings and Next Steps
Author: Ashana
Date: July 2025
Category: AI
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/launching-the-ai-cohort-program-learnings-and-next-steps/
==================================================

Last month, we launched the pilot edition of the
AI Cohort Program
—a joint initiative between Project Tech4Dev and The Agency Fund. This program is our attempt to meaningfully support the development sector in designing and building responsible AI solutions, while actively learning from the process ourselves.
We are especially excited about this initiative because we at Project Tech4Dev are also building an open-source AI platform tailored for social impact. The ideas, patterns, and solutions emerging from this program will generate valuable insights for shaping the AI platform.
Ecosystem Response
We received applications from 27 NGOs across education, health, livelihoods, gender, and governance. What stood out wasn’t just the number—it was the depth of interest, intent to experiment, and shared belief that AI can be a game-changer in the development sector.
We also witnessed a growing community of thought partners, mentors, and collaborators. People from diverse backgrounds stepped up generously to support this effort.
How is the development sector embracing AI so far?
A key learning through this process is that many NGOs are aware of AI’s potential, but lack hands-on experience or capacity to explore it meaningfully. The need is clear: dedicated hand-holding, mentoring and practical exposure.
One applicant captured this perfectly when they said:
“We don’t know where to start. It feels like an ocean, and we’re just trying to find our footing.”
Some common challenges that emerged:
Funding gaps for tech experimentation
Limited in-house tech capacity, especially for AI/ML
Lack of structured, accessible entry points to explore or prototype AI ideas
This pilot cohort is our way of bridging this gap—by offering hands-on support while learning what it actually takes to make AI adoption real, contextual, and sustainable in the sector.
Our Evaluation Framework: Designed for Ecosystem-Wide Learning
We focused on selecting use cases that are representative, replicable, and ecosystem-relevant.
Here’s the simplified version of our evaluation rubric:
Criteria
Description
Weight
Bandwidth
At least one person with 40–50% availability and basic tech comfort
60%
AI maturity
Some prior experimentation or pilot
20%
Leadership buy-in
Comfort with investing in tech (~₹10L) and strong leadership support
5%
Ecosystem relevance
Use case should benefit more than one org / be a reusable pattern
5%
Impact
Scale, depth, and potential of the solution
5%
Sustainability
Likelihood of continuing post-program (qualitative)
5%
We eventually selected 7 NGOs to be part of this pilot cohort—each working on a unique problem that, if solved well, could inform broader AI use across the sector.
Selected NGOs & Use Cases
Here’s a quick look at the organizations and the AI solutions they’re building:
Name of NGO
Use Case
SNEHA
A conversational health chatbot for pregnant women that also surfaces hidden indicators of gender-based violence. Combines behavior insights with machine learning.
IPE Global
Uses AI to integrate public health data (HMIS, ICDS, surveys) to identify malnutrition hotspots and enable targeted interventions.
Quest Alliance
A “Google Maps for Careers”—an AI-powered guidance system for young people navigating skills, jobs, and learning pathways.
Simple Education Foundation
Assessing teacher growth using qualitative, reflective inputs—interpreted via NLP models.
Avanti Fellows
AI-generated reports and a self-learning chatbot to provide personalized feedback to online students.
Inqui-lab Foundation
Evaluating creative student responses like drawings and open-ended answers using image processing and NLP.
Samanvay Foundation
Enhancing the open-source Avni platform with AI capabilities to make it cheaper, smarter, and easier to use.
🚀 What’s Next
We’re officially kicking off the cohort with our first virtual meeting in the third week of July. From there:
Each NGO will be matched with dedicated mentors
Prototyping will begin, with a goal of launching a working, testable version in a few months
We’ll run open sessions on AI tools, responsible design, ethics, and evaluation (and share these on YouTube so the wider ecosystem can learn alongside us)
We see this program not just as a pilot, but as a proof-of-concept for how AI support in the development sector can be done differently—grounded in collaboration, openness, and experimentation.
We’ll also be recording most of our sessions and sharing them on
YouTube
so others in the ecosystem can learn alongside us.
We’re excited and looking forward to launching the program and diving into the solution-building phase with our cohort!Title: Leaders within each one of us…
Author: Antony Justin
Date: May 2025
Category: Tech4Dev Sprints
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/leaders-within-each-one-of-us/
==================================================

Leaders are often showcased as those who sit in the corner office, who take high risk decisions in the boardrooms and those who speak about the achievements of the company from a podium. But real leadership is much more democratic. It is shown by each and every member of the company in the decisions each of them take every day and the integrity they show towards the values and goals of the organisation. Leadership at the top may set the vision, but leadership on the ground determines whether that vision becomes reality or fades into a PowerPoint deck.
Every company is like a ship. Though it is the captain who is at the helm, the very survival of the ship and its ability to reach its destination is based on the ability of each and every crew member to play their part and take accountability for how their actions influence the end goal. Leadership is about taking responsibility and influencing outcomes by caring about the whole and not just your part. It’s about reacting to a problem or situation regardless of whether it is part of your job description.
Ever since I became part of T4D, one aspect of daily work life that has stood out for me is the level of agency that each and every member of the team has, not only in their own immediate deliverables, but also in driving the organisation forward.
As a way of celebrating the innate leadership within the T4D team as well as to encourage and foster it even more across the team, it was decided to have a gamification exercise focused on leadership as part of the team building activities during the T4D sprint at Khopoli.
The objective of the exercise was to simulate real life situations that might be in dissonance with the values and goals of the organisations and to challenge each and every team member to don the leadership hat and take a crack at how they would go about reacting to these scenarios. The objective was also to give the team a general sense of the friction among goals, values and challenges that may be invisible to teams but is a regular feature of the day to day job of running the company. The game was designed for each of the scenarios to be exposed over time with the teams getting a fixed amount of time to decide on any one of the four options given for each scenario.
The scenarios were designed to be spread across various aspects of the organisation straddling strategy, operations, administration and innovation.
“Dogfooding”
at its best, the entire gamification was run through Glific as was the case with the entire sprint itself with each of the team captains having to enter in their choice as well as rationale through Whatsapp.
The design of the gamification session was entirely dependent on the participants connecting to the concept and outcome of the game and it was such a rewarding experience to see the energy and interest of each and every team member to ideate, deliberate and decide on the course of action on each of the scenarios.
The time duration of 12 minutes between scenarios was filled with decision making styles of many types; intense brooding, animated deliberation, banter and laughter that seemed to pay homage to the innumerable methods of being a successful leader.
The game also gave the entire team a chance to see how members within the same organisation reacted differently to different scenarios and to see areas where there was complete resonance as well as dissonance across the organisation.
Voting Patterns across the teams
It was also very interesting to note that teams that had selected the same option for some of the scenarios had completely different rationales as to why they chose their respective option !
One of the main objectives of the gamified session was to give each and every team member a sense of the gears at work behind each and every decision taken at the top.
The level of engagement and the quality of the conversations, ideas and pushbacks encountered are testimony to the leadership potential across the team and I am confident that it will continue to come forth to drive the company forward.
When everyone shows up with a sense of ownership, the organization becomes more resilient, innovative, and trustworthy and there was sufficient evidence from the session to believe that T4D is on the right track and in safe hands !Title: Learnings from Tech4Dev Sprint at Garudmaachi

This blog post is written by Akshay from
EdZola
Its been a long since I wrote a blog, but got fascinated by the idea when one of my friends reached out asking if I was participating in the Tech4Dev Sprint by reading
Lobos article
! Small world indeed. The development sector is even smaller! Here’s me decoding the amazing experience we had at GarudMaachi, Pune.
Of all the interesting conversations we had, the one I had with Lobo on Tuesday during our morning hike was super special. We discussed how to bring the technology lens to the non-profit sector, how a lot of organizations still make technology decisions based on a friend/volunteer’s opinion, and how everyone wants to build an Uber. There needs to be more amplification of voices, learnings, and resources on what works and what doesn’t and how everyone doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel.
This week was extra special as its been two years since I started
EdZola
. It is extremely gratifying to see how far we have come and were just getting started!
I had given a talk about EdZola in the sprint, and some of the things I talked about include:
Our partnership with Zoho and how Zoho can be
beneficial for non-profits
. We also discussed some of the samples of our work so far.
How low-code platforms like Zoho Creator can also create impact at scale. Read more about how our project with the
Future Perfect Program
reached a scale of around 40K students at its peak
here
.
How to bring computational thinking/tech skills to the non-profit sector. The underlying question being: Can anyone build apps? How the concept of
Citizen Development
is increasing worldwide and we will need more adopters of tech in the development sector.
Do go through the entire deck
here
.
My learnings from the Sprint include
Power of a collective
– We had developers, product architects, program leads from Non-Profits, thought leaders, and other ecosystem enablers, most of them who had the vision of enabling technology in the social sector. It was wonderful to witness conversations, brainstorming sessions, and ideas on how we can move forward as an ecosystem.
Power of Open Source
– It was great to see the depth of work done by
Glific
,
Avni
, and
Plio
in person. And open-source, as an ideology makes more and more sense to me for folks to come together and build rather than reinvent the wheel. My personal takeaway includes how we can make our work open source so that other non-profits can learn and contribute on top of it.
Practical Know-How’s –
During the presentation of NGOs on how they are leveraging Glific and other tools, it was great to see innovative ways on how organizations use the platforms to drive engagement, user adoption, etc This was a learning experience for most NGOs who were battling similar challenges.
Amplifying our voices-
On one of the days, We had
Parveen Bhardwaj
give a small visit and shared about his digital transformation journey at Swades Foundation. One thing which he pointed out was, that when he started this journey, he was not able to find many details about Tech4Good Projects or Ecosystems in spite of Googling / asking around. Even if there were, they were expensive and out of reach for most NGOs. How do we further amplify our efforts so that more and more non-profits can benefit from the work?
I’d like to thank Tech4Dev Team for the invite, and hoping to attend the next Sprint along with my tech team for even more in-depth discussions and experiments. Along with our efforts in leveraging Zoho For Impact, we will also start to explore open-source platforms like Avni, Kobo ToolBox, Metabase, and Frappe by ERPNext to see how they can benefit a large set of organizations.
I can go on and on about the Sprint, about the rain trek, food from different states, and in detail about the different sessions. A few folks have already written about them

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: November 2022
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/lessons-from-the-fractional-cxo-program-arjav-chakravarti-erica-arya/
==================================================

We are quite happy with the way our Fractional CxO(x:Tech,Data and Strategy) initiative has been received by the community. We were confident of the need for such a program but post running it for the last 3 months with 3 different NGO partners both sides are actually getting to see first-hand the significant value that is getting created.
Our fractional CxO effort with NGO A advising on technology strategy, data architectures and streamlining of internal IT processes is well on its way in its 4th month. With sustained management support for the endeavor, we have made good progress in our deliverables with the high point coming up for this month of piloting a new open source dashboarding tool, Apache Superset, for the organization. This will create the basis for our future endeavors on the data platform architecture for this NGO. The organization has also started to capacity build with training workshops and job postings setting the stage for a good chance at long term success.
Another fractional CxO effort is with NGO B where the need and focus is more on the execution of projects, building products, and ensuring that seemingly different tech initiatives align with the broader vision and objectives of the organization. We took a holistic view of the tech team structure and how it fits into the NGOs overall systems and processes. As a result we have already reorganized the team structure, opened new hiring positions, reprioritized tech initiatives and paused a few. This helps set the right base and practice to build and execute the technology strategy.
For the last one month we at Tech4Dev have been evaluating applications and holding conversations with leaders from over 20 NGOs with the aim of building a larger cohort of such NGOs who could benefit from the fractional CxO initiative. Here are some of the lessons that weve learned in this short time.
There are very few different pain points that are unique
Weve been surprised by how much the needs of vastly different NGOs overlap. Even though the NGOs work in different domains – health, education, community empowerment, research, etc. – and they operate in different countries, some common themes persist across:
Collecting data from field teams who still use pen and paper
Analysing and using data effectively, for both program improvement and M&E
Having the right visualisation tools and data abstraction clarity to present just the relevant data points to enable and ease data-based decision making at different levels of the organisation
Integrating systems that have been built by different vendors, at different times and for different purposes, to give a consistent and at times a consolidated view of the key indicators of the various programs that the organisation is driving
Reaching a large number of community members who have access to mobile devices
Not having the necessary technical expertise to ensure that the technical design of any software application (either being developed or being procured) supports the envisioned use cases or the realisation of the intended benefits
Not having the necessary expertise to evaluate different software applications and to do build vs buy analysis
Existing platforms might well solve many of these issues
A number of open source and freely available platforms have been designed to solve such commonly-encountered issues. For example:
Glific
DDP- Development Data Platform (under development)
Avni
Frappe
Apache Superset
To illustrate the point, NGO C uses scripts to manage data pipelines coupled with data transformations introduced at multiple spots in the pipeline like at data collection layer, transformation layer and at the visualization layer. Though things work well mostly once setup, this framework does not lend itself to troubleshooting when things go wrong – syncs fail, schemas change, visualization assumptions break, analysts make changes on transformations for a dashboard that cascade to other team dashboards. A platform approach like DDP that manages this entire pipeline approach with good error alerting and notifications and tracking and visibility to changes will serve this NGO better in the long run as it scales
Technology is not a substitute for clarity
Technology is an immensely powerful scaling tool but its potential will be realised only if there is clarity on the part of a program team on goals, process, SOPs and metrics. In general, an organisation should not attempt a scale up without a clear idea of what works and what doesnt, otherwise there is the likelihood of investing significant time and money in a solution that does not work as desired. The exception is the use of technology in small experiments that will inform future programs.
Alignment of technology with org strategy is critical
Some of the questions that we ask NGOs at the outset have nothing to do with technology and everything to do with strategy: What outcomes is the organisation seeking to achieve? Is there a long-term strategy in place for how the orgs programs will achieve the outcomes? How well understood is the strategy within the organisation?
A long-term technology strategy is only one part of an overall organisation strategy. Other parts include talent management, fundraising, communication, mindset of people to adopt behaviour change etc. An org that has a good handle on how it will evolve over the next few years will be able to use technology effectively to achieve its goals.
A tale of two NGOs and how the long term strategy of the organisation can change the direction of technology use: NGO D intends to provide data for evidence based interventions and is pushing for the transfer of the interventions to the public sector. In this case, technology has to align with the goal of the exit strategy to hand over to governmental bodies. Any software technology use is constrained by the way governmental bodies function. NGO E is expecting to scale tremendously and is building the organisation. In this case, the primary need is for technology to match and scale with organisational growth.
Data is too often an afterthought
Weve seen NGOs, even large ones, that are clear that technology solutions will help them deliver programs at scale. However, the element that is sometimes overlooked is how to effectively collect, analyse and use data. Data can be used to improve programs as well as for M&E and effective organisations make use of the right kind of data to assist decision making at all levels. Multiple programs of an NGO may generate data about the same households and people, and consolidating that data is critical to be able to draw an accurate picture of what is happening on the ground.
A phased tech implementation makes sense but the strategy needs to be long-term
Organisations sometimes prefer to think about a technology rollout in phases – implement one phase successfully and only then move on to the next one. We are in agreement with this approach but with a caveat: An NGO will maximise the use of tech for a scale up only if it has a long term tech strategy that supports the organisations overall strategy. Only then will the program, tech and senior management teams know how each implementation phase builds on the previous one and towards a larger goal for the organisation.
NGOs are likely to face challenges in implementing technology
NGOs faced some interesting and deep-rooted challenges:
Fear of switching to unfamiliar technologies leading to resistance
It can be difficult for the program teams at times to fully assess their technology needs comprehensively and articulate the same in a manner that is fully understood by a technologist. This can lead to lack of alignment between the teams, and the end product not being very usable for the intended end-users
Tech solutions need a sustained investment to keep them alive
Establishing the importance of using technology in driving demand/reach for social programs is a challenge with different internal and external stakeholders. Each being at a different level of understanding and comfort with technology also leads to varied acceptance of technology use in programs.
These learnings help us understand the challenges our NGO partners work in and we feel all the more confident and definitive that there is space for the CxO initiative to be adopted by them.

==================================================

“We didn’t know where to start. But now we know what we need—and we know we’re not alone.”
This line, shared during one of our recent training check-ins, sums up the quiet but powerful shift we’ve seen over the past month.
In June, the
Tech4Dev Cohort for Chennai
, featuring HRF, WEEDS, TNDWWT, and Thendral Movement, entered a deeper phase of digital transformation. The basics were in motion. Now comes the real test: implementation and ownership.
From Training Rooms to Real Tasks
Following the third field visits in early June, each NGO dove into
hands-on training sessions
covering Canva, social media management, video editing, and data tracking.
Instead of watching slide decks, the teams were:
Creating content in
Canva Pro
, learning to use brand kits and design formats for certificates, newsletters, and social media posts.
Uploading trial content to
Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube
, experimenting with thumbnails and LinkedIn posts.
Editing videos using
Active Presenter
, getting used to timelines, audio tracks, and export settings.
Beginning to build
project-wise data folders
and simple MIS tools in Excel, moving away from cluttered or overpriced systems.
For one team, saving content into the right folder became a lightbulb moment. For another, finally understanding how to apply for Google Workspace without vendor delays brought relief.
Patterns That Emerged
Across all four organizations, we noticed a familiar pattern of requirements:
A need for
simplified data systems
tailored to their projects, not generic platforms.
The desire to manage
websites independently
, without being tied to unavailable vendors.
A focus on
training in small, digestible pieces
, instead of all-at-once tech setups.
And most importantly,
confidence-building over tool-building
.
Tiny Wins, Big Confidence
WEEDS drafted and scheduled their first Facebook post.
HRF edited their first awareness video with a voice-over.
TNDWWT reorganized their Google Forms and began testing MIS formats.
Thendral Movement got geo-tagged on Google and mapped their way back to digital visibility.
Each milestone wasn’t just a task, it was a confidence checkpoint. A step toward autonomy.
What We’re Learning
The biggest challenge isn’t the software, it’s the
mindset shift
. Vendors withholding credentials, organizations unsure about domain renewals, forms used as workarounds, and mobile-first content creation, all reflect a landscape where tech isn’t absent, but hasn’t yet felt like it belonged.
What’s working?
Weekly check-ins
and direct follow-ups
Pre-scheduled tasks
that allow practice and feedback
Personal rapport
and one-on-one handholding
This journey is not about shortcuts. It’s about showing that progress doesn’t need to be perfect, just consistent.
What’s Next
As we head into July, our focus is clear:
Complete final field visits and consolidate digital assets
Help NGOs move from
trial mode to real-world application
of tools
Finalize websites and data trackers
We’re not just setting up digital tools, we’re shifting mindsets.
And like most lasting change, it starts small.Title: Listening, Learning & Building Tech with Grassroots Organisations – Month 1

==================================================

By the
People4Good
Team (
LinkedIn
) – Implementation Partner, Cohort 2025
“We’ve always wanted to use tech, but it never felt like it was built for us.”
These were the words shared by one of the grassroots organisations during one of our early meetings in Chennai. A small statement, yet one that echoed across the cohort.
Over the past two months, People4Good has been working closely with four passionate grassroots nonprofits,
HRF
,
WEEDS
,
TNDWWT
, and
Thendral Movement
, as part of the Tech4Dev-Dasra Rebuild India Fund Tech for Grassroots Cohort for Chennai. Each organization brings decades of community wisdom. But when it comes to digital tools, the terrain has often felt alien, rigid, or simply out of reach.
From Conversations to Context
We kicked off with what we believe in most – listening!
Our journey began with onboarding calls and field visits, not to audit, but to understand. In the rural areas of Mangadu, we met the team of WEEDS, where we sat with the team discussing how years of donor data lived in disconnected spreadsheets. With HRF, the conversation turned to how their project team manages reports for 38 districts using just shared folders and WhatsApp groups.
Each visit became a mirror, not just for the NGOs, but for us too. It reminded us that tech adoption is not just about tools. It’s about context, comfort, and care.
What We Found
Through our
Tech Scans
and
Tech Maturity Assessments
, we saw patterns emerge across organizations:
Cloud Storage was Paid
: Most teams weren’t enrolled in Google for Nonprofits and were paying out of pocket for limited space, unsure if tech was worth the investment.
Design & Content Creation was Ad Hoc
: Canva accounts were half-setup, unused, or forgotten. Yet every team wished they had better brochures and posts.
Data Management was Fragmented
: An org, for instance, was using 40 separate Google Forms for 40 field staff, a patchwork approach born out of necessity.
MIS Tools Didn’t Fit
: One org paid ₹18,000/year for a reporting system that couldn’t track projects separately. They had a system, but it wasn’t theirs.
Vendor Lock-Ins:
Outsourcing tech for internal operations left them hanging when the vendors were out of the picture.
Building With, Not For
Instead of proposing ready-made solutions, we co-created implementation plans. Here’s what that looked like:
Free Cloud Storage Setup
: From domain challenges to OTP loops, we navigated the chaos with the NGOs, not just for them.
Designing & Content Creation
: We introduced tools like Active Presenter and Canva based on needs for video content and designed storytelling sessions around their campaigns.
Simple Trackers that Work
: We built Excel-based MIS formats tailored to their projects and staff realities.
Social Media Support
: For some, it meant creating a basic content calendar. For others, just helping them with a domain purchase.
Change didn’t happen overnight. But it began.
What We’re Learning
One thing is clear,
technology is not the barrier
. It’s
trust
,
capacity
, and
ownership
.
We saw hesitation when Thendral Movement feared losing another domain. We saw momentum when WEEDS took ownership of their Google Workspace setup and started experimenting with Google Ads.
What’s working best? Building
personal rapport
, respecting their
time
, and breaking tech into
tiny, confident steps
.
What’s Next
As we step into June, our goals are grounded and clear:
Finalize domain setups & increase cloud storage
Complete trainings on designing, video editing & content creation
Help each org own their data through better yet simple MIS tools
We’re not just building tools, we’re building confidence. And that, we believe, is the real transformation.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: September 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/load-test-using-k6/
==================================================

Moving forward with Glific development now we have started thinking about testing the application for handling high traffic, monitoring performance trends over time, and be alerted of performance regressions.
We decided to start using k6 for load testing. It is
an open-source load testing tool
to catch performance issues. It provides enough features to write smoke, load, stress, and soak tests. It also provides options for performance testing automation.
It is a well-documented tool, which gives an easy head start for load testing with enough material at initial steps answering
why and how
,
It suggests starting small with unit load tests and then move to more scenario-specific load tests.
As load tests need time to ramp-up and execute the user journeys with the simulated traffic to gain enough measurements/data that can be acted on. Hence it is better to run it when merging code into a release branch or as a nightly build perhaps.
Load testing should happen pre-production.
To achieve maximum performance, the tool itself is written in Go, embedding a JavaScript runtime allowing for easy test scripting.
Now before going deep on features available, let’s look at the scripts code for reference
To understand complete code structure refer to the
test life cycle
. To get started scripts must contain, at the very least, a default function. Here we keep the check / assert for API responses. This defines the entry point for all VUs.
And the
results standard output
looks like this:
Lets try to understand the features available here one by one.
When using VUs concept it runs tests with more than one virtual user parallelly. We can also specify it while executing the k6 run command.
k6 provides a list of
built-in metrics
that will be displayed in results standard output after completion of each test. Also, we can add custom metrics.
We can start with basic metrics like checks and http_req_duration to analyze our tests and to understand how the application is behaving with high load. We would need to use other metrics to analyze it in more detail and reach conclusions for performance improvements. A few of the metrics are:
Vus, vus_max, iterations, iteration_duration, dropped_iterations, data_received, data_sent, checks
HTTP-specific built-in metrics : Http_reqs, http_req_duration
Types of metrics are: gauge, counter, trend, rate.
To
visualize the result output
over a period of time we can store it using
JSON
or InfluxDB output plugins (there are more options available).
And then create the graphs as per our requirement. To visualize data stored in InfluxDB,
Grafana
open-source package is used, which provides charts, graphs, and alerts.
More options can be added to the test scripts which include tags and groups, thresholds, stages (for
ramping up/down the VUs
).Title: MEDHA STPC Project Completion

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: July 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/make-it-work-make-it-right-make-it-better/
==================================================

The title is a slightly modified version of KentBack’s original statement “make it work, make it right, make it fast”.
This is a popular statement in the software world, which simply means to finish a complex problem break it down into three phases. I’ll try explaining this with a recent software problem I worked on in Glific.
After the
backend team was done
researching on RapidPro Floweditor and finalizing that it’s the right tool for us to go with, my task was to integrate it within Glific and create a seamless user experience. That means I had to integrate a separate working React app into our React app.
Make It Work
TLDR; it wasn’t easy but eventually we made it work.
To get started, this wasn’t a regular npm/yarn package. It’s a separate application to be integrated into Glific with no guidelines or documentation. On paper, it was only the concept of how to integrate an external app into React. The risk of spending effort and then finding this is not the “the” tool was somewhat lesser but still high. Well, there weren’t many options either.
At first, things didn’t work as expected. Deleting everything and reinstalling at least 10 times, just to get the right version of the Floweditor may give you an idea of what could’ve happened next. Thanks to the in-depth research and collaboration with the backend team, the pace increased and we had a working piece in just 2 days.
Make It Right
Now we had a working functionality in place, we needed to undo the shortcuts we had taken. This phase means to clean the software code and make it meaningful.
For me, it primarily included:
Removing the hard-coded files and redundant packages
Clean up duplicate code
Putting a better file structure in place
Make It Better
Most software developers see this as an optional phase and skip this. There could be various reasons like time constraints, work overload, small-scale software not to be worked on further, etc. While skipping this is a right step or not is subjective, it certainly wasn’t right in this case. Being an open-source project, it’s important to make it easy for fellow developers to work on the project.
Things I did to make the overall feature better:
Avoiding manual steps
Easy setup commands
Updating README with simple and easy to understand instructions

==================================================

Capacity building, training programs, and workshops form the backbone of growth and development within government and non-profit ecosystems. These initiatives are not just expenditures- they are strategic investments aimed at shaping the capabilities of employees, partners, and stakeholders.
Yet, after every such session, one question lingers in the minds of the organisers:
“Was it worth it?” –
Did we achieve our objectives? Were the participants engaged? What impact did this session truly make?
A successful intervention followed by the
right assessment
gives organisations the answers they need. It not only validates the effectiveness of their training investments but also empowers participants to reflect on their learning outcomes.
Use Case – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)
NRLM
is a flagship program in India aimed at
reducing rural poverty
by enabling economic and social empowerment of women through Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and other Community-Based Organisations (CBOs). Institutions like the
National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD)
and
State Institutes of Rural Development (SIRD)
play a pivotal role in designing and executing training content for these members.
While training programs for NRLM are extensively designed, data on training effectiveness and impact remains
underutilised
, leading to inefficiencies in budget allocation, curriculum design, and training implementation. With a vast membership of nearly
10 crore women
under the aegis of NRLM, there is an urgent need to streamline data collection,
improve training efficiency
, and ensure capacity-building efforts are outcome-driven.
Missing Piece
While supporting training efforts for officials of
NRLM
, Veddis Foundation, a leading non-profit working at the intersection of technology and governance-faced this recurring challenge:
There was
no robust, flexible, open-source tool
available to conduct fair and effective assessments at scale.
Existing solutions were either too rigid, expensive, or not aligned with the needs of mission-driven organisations.
Our answer – Project Sashakt
In response to this gap, we at
Project
Tech4Dev
are collaborating with Veddis Foundation and Avanti Fellows
to build a
generic, open-source assessment platform
-one that could be used by any organisation to create, customise, and conduct assessments with ease.
Project Sashakt is meant to be a highly adaptable and open-source assessment tool designed for non-profits and government bodies to evaluate the impact of their training  programs and enhance decision-making through data-driven insights.
Our goal is to make this a
Digital Public Good (DPG)
, so that it can serve multiple stakeholders. Open access to the platform would enable cross-sector collaboration and contribute to a larger ecosystem of knowledge-driven governance reforms.
What can Sashakt do?
Configure multiple question types (MCQS, open-ended, ratings, etc.)
Tag and classify questions based on topics, skills, or regions and more
Combine questions into custom assessments, tests, and  quizzes
Save assessments as reusable templates or deploy them directly to participants
Allow candidates to participate anonymously or via registration
Collect and analyse data to generate meaningful insights
All this is wrapped in a
minimalistic, user-friendly interface
, mindful of the diverse contexts in which it may be deployed, from grassroots NGOs to state-level institutions.
Sashakt: Test-Taker Interface
What’s Next?
We’re currently in the
development phase
, and our team is working hard to release the first version of the platform soon. With Project Sashakt, we hope to make assessments easier, smarter, and more accessible for everyone.
At
Project
Tech4Dev
, we believe that when assessments are simple and insightful, impact becomes measurable; that’s when real change begins.

Meta Data For Urban Data  Portal OpenCity
”
MetaData absolutely tells you everything about somebodys life. If you have enough metadata you dont really need content[Its] sort of embarrassing how predictable we are as human beings.
– Stewart Baker
As David Weinberger said
To a collector of curios, the dust is metadata
. Metadata contain information needed to understand and effectively use the data.This includes documentation of the data set contents, context, quality and accessibility. Data is essential to understanding and monitoring the health of the dynamically changing environment. Comprehensive metadata is the key to unlock those resources, thereby allowing the broad and long term use of the data.
What is Metadata ?
MetaData is data that provides information about other data. In short, it is Data about data. Metadata makes working with data easier like allowing the user to sort or locate specific dataset/documents.Some examples of metadata are file size, author, file format etc. Metadata can be created manually or through automation. With manual creation, the accuracy will be more as it allows the user to input relevant information. Automated metadata creation can be more elementary ,usually only displaying basic information such as file size ,extension etc.
Why does Open City require MetaData ?
OpenCity
is an urban data portal supported by
Oorvani Foundation
and
Data Meet
whose mission is to bring visibility and transparency into urban local governance and enable data based decision making in cities.
In OpenCity we have
534 datasets
and
1314 documents
for which creation of metadata was tedious because all the metadata elements cannot be obtained directly by single method. We need to use both manual and automated methods to meet the requirement. So, through this blog I would like to share our journey of creation of metadata.
How did we select Metadata Elements?
Selection of the metadata elements completely depends on the community of users. The metadata elements that we choose should ultimately reflect the different information needs of users. The general metadata is likely to be more accessible to broader communities. Keeping in mind all these we selected the following metadata elements.
Title
: The name given to the dataset/documents by the creator or publisher.
Theme
: A cluster or a category into which a dataset/document belongs.
Group
: Groups contain the information to determine the datasets that match specific criteria.
City
: Spatial location of the content of the resources.
Author:
The person primarily responsible for the intellectual content of the resources.
File Size
: The size of the file is the amount of space the datasets/documents takes up.
Extension
: The physical manifestation of the resources.
Type
: The nature or genre of the content of the resources.
Tags
: These are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a dataset/document is about.
Entity (Organization)
: The organization who is responsible for making significant contributions to the content of the resource.
Published Data
: A date associated with creation or availability of the resources.
How did we get MetaData ?
Initially we had some metadata for datasets and documents like
Author
Name
,
Entity (Organization)
,
Published Date
and
AWS links
. After that we followed an automated approach through which with the help of AWS links we tried to get file name, file size and extension. This process cannot be used for getting remaining metadata elements. Hence we manually created them.
For the automated process we used python coding and extracted
Title
,
File Size
and
Extension
for each dataset. Here is the sample code along with output.
Next comes the most important element of metadata that is
Grouping of datasets
. A dataset/documents groups are typically related  to specific criteria. We can define a group based on many of the attributes associated with the datasets such as dataset name, size, type, city etc. Groups contain the information to determine the datasets that match specific criteria. When the user searches for a dataset/document , he/she will be recommended with similar kinds of datasets/documents. Here on the OpenCity platform we manually went through each dataset and done the  grouping to be more confident about the accuracy. Here is an example of grouping of datasets:
A crucial, yet often overlooked feature of any data portal is
easy discoverability of datasets
. Its achieved through various ways, and categorisation of each dataset to a particular
theme
is an important aspect.
The OpenCity portal, with more than 500 datasets and growing, used a less than desirable categorisation. The various
topics
in use were as follows.
Election
Government
Governance
Environment
Health
Weather
These are not easily distinguishable from one another and don’t adequately represent the wide variety of data already available on the portal.  For e.g., A subject matter expert might clearly understand the theoretical differences between
government
and
governance.
However, to the general public, its merely two words that sound a lot like each other.
While we envisaged building an automated script to categorise datasets into various themes, such an endeavour was fraught with all the inadequacies of trying to mimic innate human understanding. A portal with hundreds of thousands of datasets might have required an AI-led approach. Fortunately, OpenCity is at a stage where we can engage in manual categorization. At the outset, we also set ourselves the following goals.
Mutual Exclusivity:
A dataset or document can fall into only one category
2.
Not more than 10 themes:
A proliferation of themes will defeat the purpose of categorisation, i.e. easy discoverability.
Before we started on this process, we went through other open city data portals for
New York City
,
Bristol
,
Washington DC
,
London
,
Seattle
,
Baltimore
,
Glasgow
,
Amsterdam
,
Chicago
, etc to understand how they approached the issue of categorization. We realised that theres no universally accepted formula.
Most cities went with themes as broad as
Care and Well-being
in Amsterdam to
Buildings
in Chicago, to reflect the priorities of their cities. It became clear to us that we had to identify the priorities of citizens. Fortunately, we had in our hands access to an online survey conducted at the start of the project, which got close to 105+ responses from various urban citizens and within it, a prioritized list of topics and themes that the participants preferred.
Working off of the list, we arrived at the following
8 themes
,
and every dataset and document on OpenCity falls into one of these categories, ensuring that we met the two goals we set for ourselves at the beginning of the process.
Summary :
This is how we created the metadata for the Open City platform. The other elements of metadata like city, tags, etc were also created manually.
Do share your thoughts of creating metadata in the comment section.
Until then let’s liberate our knowledge because
Metadata liberates us, liberates knowledge

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Glific

==================================================

?What?s in a name?? I find myself chanting over and over. It?s 3:37am by the clock. A visual dictionary is opened next to me, to a chapter on 17th century architecture. I?ve already gone through the chapters on space, human anatomy, molecular chemistry. A thesaurus by the side is stuck at the word ?communication?, google search has led to 100?s of pages on various subjects from animal sounds to baby naming techniques. In summary, I still stood at the need for one name with one cue and infinite possibilities. Team has been awaiting a name to call this project by. ?Two-way-communication-platform? as it turns out, isn?t as efficient as a person tired of thinking of a name would imagine. So what?s in a name and what could we really call our two-way communication platform? Read on to explore the foundations of the naming process and how we finally arrived at it.
Functional use of the name
It is common knowledge that the name should easily suggest what the product is all about. It should also be easy on incantation. Having a maximum of 3 syllables provides an advantage for memory. Deriving a name from a common tongue sits easy on it and helps become a part of everyday use. Making it simple to type allows our intended audience to reach the name will less errors and frustration. Added to all this, if the name is interesting, it may spark a conversation (like how it happened for
ColoredCow
). And once a conversation begins, you have the attention of the other person to hear the product story.
For this two-way communication platform, I began exploring the words that resonated with ?chat?, ?communication?, ?community?, ?talk?, ?exchange?. I also wanted to add a layer of depth to it with the depiction of ?impact? or an end result of the product.
Some of the initial options we had were:
Tides/Waves, Sway, Interakt, Aristochat, LivesTallk, OSSmosis
Making meaning
The closed team working on the project had really been eliminating and selecting the names so far and with some of our discussions, we decided to open it up to a larger audience to pick their favourites. With quite a few options in the basket, some of the ones that stood out were TalkPoint, which was the choice of most for its ease of remembering and ability to explain the product idea. The votes revealed Talkpoint, Interakt as top 2 names with Glific lingering over at the back. At this time, TalkPoint failed the trademark test. Interakt looked shaky due to its spelling. We tried to pull it out of the trenches and revive it by trying
interactapp.com
so we could retain ?Interact? word in its true form and also have a domain available. But it was still slipping out of the grasp and we let it.
Through this muddy affair of name picking, what shone through was Glific. The name is derived from ?Glyph? which was the first symbol used to communicate. Without latching on to the derivation too much, the neutrality of the name struck. It was quick to pronounce and gave all the room to brand it however we wanted. Three syllables would be a good purchase we thought but two is a bargain. Its domain was available and all the signs suggest a positive for the trademark search. And hence we went ahead with Glific. It would be a new word in the glossary when looking for words that mean communication.Title: Managing Ideas for Product Roadmap – FundImpact

==================================================

We started seeding product ideas of FundImpact with some broad assumptions and within few days the list grew into feature deck of an ERP solution. On top of this, our participants in the user study had poured even more ideas that they find are extremely important.
Everything under the sun, is perhaps, not a good starting point for developing a product roadmap. We quickly realized that we need to refine our ideas and prioritize features for a more feasible roadmap in the coming weeks.
In this blog, I’ll share how at FundImpact we are evolving our Product roadmap. We have organically developed this process to better manage the ideas and build a common understanding of what we are envisioning.
Beginning with a Concept Note
Our initial ideas and discussions about FundImpact converged into a
concept note
and we were confident that it was good enough starting point to give a solid ground to the Product Roadmap. However, as dive deep into User Research Programme our assumptions on certain features were not validated by actual stakeholders.
Our participants are very ambitious about the product vision and are sharing lot of useful insights on how we should develop the product. Our
very first interaction
challenged us to revamp the entire technical concept of FundImpact.
Tools used
: We have used Google Docs for drafting our ideas, LucidChart for creating the flow diagrams and Balsamiq / Adobe XD for creating wireframes.
Revisiting Sticky Notes for consolidation of Ideas
After our initial interactions, we decided to go back to Sticky notes and converge ideas from our initial concept note and learning from user research programme to create more generalized feature set that can cater to large base of user groups.
FundImpact Product Ideas consolidated using Sticky notes
We had to create several versions of these whiteboards to maintain a clear distinction of original source of ideas. We had a whiteboard for
client
,
internal team
and then a
final consolidated
version. This practice ensured that we are not diluting anybody’s idea and can always revisit the design process.
Tool Used
: We are using Google Jamboard for creating these Ideaboards.
From Sticky Note to the Feature List
A fruitful thing that emerged from this exercise was
feature category
. We were able to club our ideas into more logical grouping and think through about their technological implementation. These groupings would eventually form the pillar of FundImpact and define the technical architecture.
Now, we wanted to formalize our findings into a more workable format. Sticky notes are convenient for visualizing and summarizing, but we wanted to go back to our concept note to create a more detailed version of these refined ideas.
A working feature list to refine the Product Roadmap
We created
our working list
of features/ideas from the whiteboard and added a few more parameters for selection of final set of features for the product roadmap. These parameters are like – how important is the feature?; the product category; source of idea, would you vote for it be in the product roadmap, etc.? Some of these parameters are mentioned below:
Feature Name:
Its very critical to evolve a product nomenclature and build a common understanding of what each feature means and what is its scope.
Importance:
We take a polling from stakeholders on how important the feature is for the product roadmap.
Feature or Concept
: A lot of ideas were still in nascent stage i.e. we still didn’t know how they would be technically implemented. Therefore, we decided to label them as
Concept
. This distinction greatly helped us in sorting and clarifying what we should be putting the roadmap.
Feature Category:
The logical grouping of features.
Tool Used
: We are using Coda.io for managing this feature list
Re-Thinking about Solutions
The next step in our approach is to think about ways of technically implementing these different features/ideas. A cursory look at the list gives us confidence on designing reusable components.
A major reconsideration on the product architecture was doing away with the
Deliverable cards
. We earlier thought, a project would have several deliverable cards, where each card would have funding details and the activities which are time bound and tied to that fund . However, in our user research programme, we discovered that it is not a practical solution on ground (no matter how sound it may look from management point of view). It is a very rigid feature.
We are now contemplating on creating a much more flexible feature than a fixed parameters in a Deliverable Card. A
list feature
which will enable users to create their own custom list items, custom columns, etc. These lists can be defined by user to track Funding Details, Project Activity Details, Impact details, etc.
I hope process and tools mentioned in this blog would give you ideas on how to better manage a product roadmap. If you have any suggestions and ideas, please drop in your comments, we’ll be happy to learn from your experience.
Stay tuned for next update on this blog. We’ll be posting the concept v2 of FundImpact.Title: Maximising Impact: Ummeed & Dalgo’s Approach to Data-Driven, Trans-Disciplinary Clinical Care
Author: Pratiksha Rao
Date: April 2025
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/maximising-impact-ummeed-dalgos-approach-to-data-driven-trans-disciplinary-clinical-care/
==================================================

Ummeed Child Development Center serves children with and at risk of developmental disabilities. There are over
50 million children
with disabilities in India. Early identification and timely intervention has long term positive outcomes for the child, which doesn’t happen in India and their voices go unheard. When they do happen, interventions tend to focus on making the child “normal” and fixing deficits rather than leveraging strengths and supporting what the child needs, to be able to participate in life like all children.
Ummeed’s vision is that all children with and at-risk of developmental disabilities reach their full potential and are included in society. Serving approximately
15,500
children through over
152,000
clinical sessions and training over
11,200
professionals, Ummeed has indirectly impacted around 560,000 children and families across India and other low- and middle-income countries.
As Ummeed expanded its services, the organization faced challenges in unifying data across its Clinical Management System (CMS) and Training Management System (TMS). Dalgo’s intervention aimed to integrate these systems, enhancing data accessibility, operational efficiency, and the ability to deliver holistic care.
Ummeed’s Work
Established in 2001, Ummeed Child Development Center (
www.ummeed.org
) has, through its “family-centred approach”, been providing direct and indirect services to enable the participation, empowerment, and inclusion of children with developmental disabilities and their families in society. This has been done through:
Direct clinical services
– including diagnosis and therapy services – at Ummeed’s center in Lower Parel, Mumbai. These services have over time expanded to include an early intervention center (EIC) to help disabled children become school ready, caregiver training to build their knowledge and skills, and a family resource center (FRC) as a way for families to support other families in their life journeys.
Training and capacity building for professionals
– doctors, therapists, teachers, and community workers – through short-term and long-term training to expand their knowledge and skills related to child development and disability intervention. These programs now have a reach across almost every state and union territory, and have led to partnerships with other organizations, certificate courses run in collaboration with universities, and government engagements.
Research
to gather and disseminate data and evidence that is clinically sound and culturally relevant.
Building awareness
to change societal attitudes, reduce stigma, and build allies.
Over the next 5 years, i.e., over 2025-2030, Ummeed will build on this work so as to focus its impact on three key ecosystems that disabled children and their families rely on heavily – Healthcare, Schools, and Communities (with a specific focus on inclusive early childhood development). The goal is to shift these ecosystems to become more supportive and inclusive of children with and at risk of developmental disabilities and their families – so that they can reach their full potential and be included in society.
Ummeed’s Data Needs
As can be seen above, Ummeed serves children with and at risk of developmental disabilities and their families via the clinic. Professionals working with them such as doctors, therapists, teachers, community workers, receive training and capacity building services from Ummeed.
Families may avail multiple services under these different initiatives – e.g., clinical sessions, services of the Family Resource Center, as well as caregiver trainings. Likewise, professionals who attend Ummeed’s training programs may be serving some of Ummeed’s existing families or may refer children and families to Ummeed for clinical or Family Resource Center services. Thus, there are clear intersections between Ummeed’s various programs, and this is intentional given the need to bring about systemic change.
However, Ummeed’s technology solutions are siloed. The clinic uses a Clinic Management System (CMS) for patient registration, appointment scheduling, and patient records (more than
15,500 unique patient records
and
150,000 clinical sessions
). The training and capacity building vertical uses a Training Management System (TMS) that contains training scheduling and participant registration information (more than
14,000 unique participant records
). The information from these two systems do not interact with each other.
While the integrated interventions provided for the child, directly via the clinic and indirectly via training of professionals and caregivers, have a compounding positive effect on the child’s development – the segregated data from the CMS and TMS makes it hard to combine and trace the journey of the child and family served by Ummeed’s work. To be able to unify the data and analysis across these program verticals, Ummeed needed to enable a Data and Insights practice using data analytics technology, process transformation, and deeper competencies in analytics and automation.
How Data is Currently Used
Track and Resolve Issues Across Programs:
Monitor, track and address challenges arising in both clinical services and training programs.
Ensure Accountability and High-Quality Service Delivery:
Access real-time information on session conducted and trainings held
Analyze Trends and Patterns:
Understand the trends in terms of children seen and participants trained across a time period to optimize resource allocation.
Generate Comprehensive Reports:
Provide stakeholders with insights into program effectiveness and areas for improvement.
Monitor Statistics and Take Action:
Make data-driven decisions based on output and outcome indicators.
Challenges in Data Use
Despite having finely tuned Data Collection systems, Ummeed faced significant data-related inefficiencies:
Manual Data Processing:
Combining data from both systems required extensive manual effort, increasing the risk of errors and consuming valuable staff time. The manual data cleaning, transformation, and upload/sharing process took up multiple hours of a dedicated full-time resource and was prone to a high risk of errors.
Versioning & Documentation Gaps:
Lack of structured documentation and version control made it difficult to understand and roll back changes, collaborate with others, and retain knowledge through changes in staffing.
Siloed Data Systems:
The CMS and TMS operated independently, hindering a unified view of a child’s journey and the overall impact of integrated services.
Limited Data Accessibility:
Staff had difficulty accessing real-time, comprehensive data, impacting decision-making and timely interventions.
Scalability Concerns:
The existing data infrastructure was not equipped to support Ummeed’s plans for systemic change across healthcare, education, and early childhood development ecosystems.
These challenges led to reduced operational efficiency, delays in decision-making, and difficulties in tracking clinic & training trends at scale.
Dalgo’s Intervention
Ummeed partnered with Dalgo to integrate and automate data processing across its CMS and TMS, revolutionizing data management and utilization.
The Dalgo Team collaborated with Team Members from Ummeed including Vinodhini, Cherian, Ninad and Vikrant to implement a solution taking into consideration their needs.
Dalgo implemented a system that
Integrated & Automated Data Systems:
Unified CMS and TMS data, with automated pipelines, providing a hassle-free yet holistic view of each child’s interaction with Ummeed’s services.
Enhanced Data Accessibility, Quality and Collection:
Provided real-time, comprehensive insights to all stakeholders. Enabled monitoring of Data Quality through elementary to correct data collection issues at the source, and identified and fixed gaps in data collection.
Has Completely Customized, Scalable Dashboards with documentation:
Customized, scalable dashboards with relevant charts that monitor key indicators and answer key questions, customized filters and aesthetics, segregated by program, with row-level and program-level access. Also Implemented structured version control and documentation, ensuring efficient management of future updates and expansion.
Manual Process Before Dalgo
Automated ELT Process After Dalgo
CMS and TMS Data is synced to Dalgo Weekly automatically > stored in postgres warehouse.
Dalgo runs DBT Transformations on the data once the data has been pulled in.
Superset Dashboards update with the new data.
Impact on Ummeed’s Operations
Dalgo’s automation significantly enhanced Ummeed’s operations at multiple levels:
“The introduction of the dashboard has been a game-changer for our team. It has significantly reduced the time spent on compiling data manually, allowing us to focus more on analysis and decision-making rather than repetitive tasks. Earlier, creating reports required pulling data from multiple sources and cleaning it manually – a process that was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. With the inbuilt data transformations in the dashboard, the data cleaning process has become much more streamlined and efficient. Overall, it has improved our workflow, enhanced data quality, and empowered us to respond more quickly and confidently with insights.” – Vinodhini Umashankar, Associate Director – Monitoring & Evaluation
Operational Dashboards for the Clinic and Training Programs:
The automated dashboards have empowered program teams to make data-driven decisions focused on improving efficiency. This has also eliminated manual data handling, freeing up resources to focus on higher-value tasks.
These tools support optimal resource allocation, ultimately enhancing services for children, families, and professionals. Additionally, the Monitoring and Evaluation team uses the dashboards to track progress, identify mission drift, and provide regular updates to donors and management.
Child’s Journey Mapping:
By integrating various data sets, Ummeed has been able to map the comprehensive, multi-disciplinary services accessed by each child and their family. This aligns closely with Ummeed’s transdisciplinary approach to care. Clinicians now gain a holistic view of a child’s journey at the time of consultation, allowing them to deliver more informed guidance and connect families to appropriate services for optimal outcomes.
Way Forward
By leveraging Dalgo’s expertise in data integration and automating data insights, Ummeed has transformed its operational efficiency, improved decision-making, and enhanced its ability to deliver holistic care. This case study exemplifies how technology-driven solutions can empower organizations to create lasting social change.
In the coming years, Ummeed plans to:
Integrate Advanced Analytics:
Build more sophisticated data models that will allow Ummeed to better understand and visualize the journey of the child through its various services and thus improving program outcomes.
Expand Systemic Interventions:
Turn consolidated data into actionable insights that improve outcomes for children and families across the ecosystems
Integrate Interventions to Understand Child Outcomes:
With better understanding of the journey of the child Ummeed hopes to integrate the information with child development outcomes. This will prove to be a valuable evidence base that early identification, timely intervention, and trans-disciplinary care collectively influence child outcomes.
Advocate for Data-Driven Policies:
Collaborate with government and other stakeholders to promote policies supporting integrated data systems in child development services.

I was listening to a podcast from The Seen and the Unseen yesterday where Amit Varma and Nilanjana Roy were having a 4-hour conversation (thanks to Bangalore traffic, I can afford to listen to a 4-hour conversation in just one day’s commute). Nilanjana Roy started with the importance of being immersed in the present as something that was easy in her childhood (no TV, no internet, no cell phones), and how that shaped her as a person.
In today’s world, one of the best ways to get this “immersive” experience is to get to a place where cell phones don’t work, rains don’t stop and surround yourself with just nature and a bunch of passionate people who care about their work.
This happened last week at
Garudmaachi
, a remote place about 2 hours away from Pune where the
Avni
team participated in a sprint along with a lot of NGOs in the education space, and a handful of technology organisations that work in the development sector. There was a lot of fun and learning that happened over the week. Many have written about it in detail in the
Tech4Dev blog
. This is a brief note on my learning and experience.
Learning about the education space
The focus of this sprint was education. I was familiar with a few interventions before joining the sprint – in-person mentoring, job-readiness courses, assistance for internship programmes and a teacher effectiveness improvement programme using the World Bank’s Teach tool. This sprint opened my eyes to many other kinds of interventions that were possible.
These interventions had goals that were different from what I had seen before – focus on the arts, English literacy, building civic engagement among adolescents, the internals of Teach4India fellowships and many more. They were also using different models to scale – through teachers, volunteers or just using technology platforms such as
Glific
.
Rahul from VOPA presented his organization’s work
There was one particular instance called
V-school
where they scaled regular curriculum creation using volunteers/teachers to cover instruction in the specific dialect of Marathi that students were familiar with.
Learning about technology
On the technology side, I was introduced to
EdZola
and the toolkit they curated to build technologies for nonprofits. I loved Akshay’s ideas, maybe I will dabble with some of them when I get the mind space for it. Surya from
Avanti Fellows
talked about ideas in AI/machine learning that can be used by NGOs. Swapneel talked about building a data culture in the organisation.
Knowing Glific
Finally, this being primarily a
Glific
sprint, I found the ways people use to engage with their beneficiaries very interesting. This was not particularly useful from an Avni perspective, but just another data point to go sit at the back of my head.
Why this was useful to me and to the Avni team
I think the sprint was wonderful for the
Avni
team for team bonding, finishing up some long-pending items and recuperating.
Some of us joined
Avni
during the pandemic, and this was the first time we were meeting in person. It helped us build a connection amongst ourselves.
Since the pandemic, I had forgotten the dynamic of working in person. We fixed a lot of things, finished some deliverables and learnt from one another.
We participated in many activities – from attending regular presentations to having in-depth talks, fun outdoor activities like treks, football and swimming to karaoke nights and small talk. It gave us a break from our normal work and life routines.
The sprint was organised by
Tech4Dev
which is building an ecosystem of technology orgs, NGOs and foundations that work towards creating social impact in developing countries. I think sprints like these help build deeper relationships across organisations. This can help in the future through connections, cross-pollination of ideas and a sense of community. Looking forward to the next sprint.
PS: An idea just popped up while I was writing this. One of the problems NGOs, and especially tech groups working in this space face is the inability to find like-minded people. I don’t think this is because there is a lack of passionate people. It is probably because it is hard to navigate the space unless you already have a foot in it. And because we don’t really socialize well enough? Maybe next time we can have an open invitation to people who just want to “audit” the course? Hang out with a group of people and see if it fits their lifestyle?Title: Meetings with funders in India about Tech4Dev

==================================================

During the period between the 2nd and 9th of August, members of the Tech4Dev group met with a variety of funders in India, to discuss the technology needs of the social sector, understand their perspectives on supporting the development of software solutions, and to explain the approach that is being followed by the Tech4Dev initiative.
We met philanthropists who run family foundations, representatives of companies with major CSR initiatives as well as intermediaries that support development sector initiatives.
A theme that ran through most of the meetings was that there was a great need in the sector for what Tech4Dev provides, and that as a group, we should aim to be more ambitious. This increase in ambition spans multiple aspects of our work, and has been drawn out below. We now need to discuss and decide as a group about the path that Tech4Dev will take over the next few years.
1. Scale of supported organizations
Funders appreciated that Tech4Dev had mostly focused on working with smaller social organizations. While the challenges faced by these organizations were clear, the funders also asked about our plans to work with medium and large organizations in order to reach many more people. One person asked about which of these approaches would be more valuable ? supporting one NGO that worked with 100,000 people or 10 NGOs, each of which worked with 1000 people. Our answer was that each of these was possibly valuable in its own way. We have gained experience over the past few years of how to support smaller NGOs and now want to support a few medium and large NGOs, so that in a year or two we can support a range of organizations of different sizes.
2. Government
Government is a key stakeholder in the Indian development sector. The question was raised on how Tech4Dev would help government develop and adopt open source solutions which could then be shared with multiple state, central and local government ministries and departments. We were also told that since NGOs that work with government often take cues from the latter on what technology solutions to adopt, building an ecosystem of open source software would require Tech4Dev to have a plan to work with government. While working directly with government ministries or departments is perhaps not something that the Tech4Dev team is set up to do, we hope to support software partners and NGOs that can play this role.
3. Selecting NGOs
We had to explain the criteria used to select organizations for cohort 1 of Tech4Dev as well as share thoughts on the criteria for cohort 2. We will have to think about strengthening our diligence process to make sure that funders have the confidence that any NGOs that they support through Tech4Dev are doing good work, and that they have the required compliances and registrations in place. As Tech4Dev works with a greater number of NGOs and software partners, the selection process needs to be streamlined to make sure that the quality of organizations as well as the work remains paramount.
4. Dissemination
This was called out by a few people as an essential part of ecosystem building; that it would be important to not just support good organizations but also make sure that others in the development sector knew of the solutions that had been built and used. Dissemination will need to cover focus areas in which Tech4Dev has helped build solutions, e.g., public health through OpenCHS, as well as educate the sector on how to effectively leverage technology.
5. Education
The need for supporting NGO leadership at all levels to understand and adopt technology within their organizations was underscored. This was considered a key aspect of a successful technology deployment, and especially important to do upfront, before a technology project began in earnest.
6. Impact measurement
This question was raised a few times ? ?How does Tech4Dev measure its impact?? While we were clear that we have a long way to go to be able to measure impact effectively, we did describe the changes that each organization in cohort 1 had experienced, and how these had helped the organization achieve certain social outcomes.
7. Structure and governance
We had to describe what Tech4Dev was a few times. There was some confusion about whether it was an organization, a platform or an initiative. There were also questions about where it was housed in India (currently it is a virtual org), who ran the organization and who made the payments to software partners. We were asked to prioritize the establishment of an entity in India that would be the long-term home of Tech4Dev.
8. Organizational systems
While Tech4Dev has focused on providing technology solutions for NGO?s programs, some funders mentioned the importance of guiding NGOs on the backend systems to deploy – for accounting, donor management, emails, etc. For a number of NGOs, the addressal of these needs is as urgent as the use of technology for programs.Title: Meghalaya Trip Report – Jul 2024

Introduction
I had a week in between work trips, and decided on a lark to do a week long trip to Shillong. Mari had met some friends from San Francisco for lunch in Mumbai, and they mentioned that Shillong was their next destination. When I looked it up, I realized that it seemed like an amazing place, and well worth a visit. I figured I could do a combination of remote work, visit local NGOs and get some good hikes.
Photo taken from close to the top of Kynrem falls, was amazed as to how close and dangerous it is!
The
Rebuild India Fund
from
Dasra
supports a few NGOs in the Northeast. From a development and
social sector perspective
, the northeast
has been ignored
for a long time. In the past few years, thanks to initiatives like Rebuild and others, the region is receiving a bit more attention and support. Some of the articles linked above, give you a much better context and background info on the region.
Meghalaya is incredibly beautiful. I was there during the monsoons, the waterfalls were spectacular and as good if not better than the iconic Yosemite waterfalls. The scenery and foliage across the state is dense and vibrant. Noticed that pineapples, jackfruit and bananas were quite prevalent. Karthik from Saura Mandala mentioned that one of the theories floating around (since i could not find any evidence of this on the web) is that Meghalaya was part of Kerala in the Gondwana era, and hence there is some commonality between the two regions, vegetation and culture (both are matri-lineal societies). Definitely need to go back and visit the other Northeastern states on subsequent trips to India.
Organizations Visited
I had met
Shannon
in San Francisco a few months ago during the Rebuild tour of US. I connected with her and in addition to connecting me with a homestay and guide, she also connected me with a few other NGOs in the region. I spent a couple of hours every day to have an informal conversation with the NGO leaders of these organizations, who were kind enough to explain to me their work and also the larger context in which they operate. Some things that stood out to me were:
All the NGOs I spoke with had a budget of less than 10 CR, even though all of them were working in multiple districts and villages across the state and had a staff size between 20-150 people.
Meghalaya (and maybe the Northeast) in general is fairly low on many of the indicators including education, employment.
There seems to be a fairly large issue with opportunities for youth across the state
I was really surprised as to how dominant the church (different denominations) across the state. I come from a region (Mangalore) where the church is strong, but this was at a totally different level
Many of the NGOs had a pretty good relationship with the State Government who were helping them meet their mission.
A large part of the funding for most NGOs used to be from international agencies. As the ground is shifting with regard to this funding, they are now working to get local and retail funding.
Faith Foundation
This was my longest meeting and also an introduction to the social sector in the Northeast. It was really fun interacting with the group and asking them all sorts of questions about Meghalaya, schools, culture, religion and more. The state does not rank very high on the employment and education index, and also ranks fairly high on the abuse against minors and Faith is working towards ensuring the safety of children and adolescents using a combination of couselling, peer education, group sessions and more. Faith is run by a a group of women professionals from the indigenous Khasi tribe. More on my visit in their
linked.in post
.
The faith foundation team that I spoke with
NESFAS
I met Pius and his team at the lovely offices of NESFAS in Shillong. Once again, got an introduction and education to the food culture in Meghalaya. Nesfas is focussed on promoting and revitalizing local and indigenous food in the region while upholding their cultural integrity. The state imports quite a bit of food from other states (Bihar, West Bengal), even though it could potentially have a thriving food culture. NESFAS wants to change this and help incorporate local foods into the system and even in school mid-day meals. They are also working on preserving the biodiversity of the region by working with communities and the government.
Bethany Society
I met Carmo on an NGO Fundraising WhatsApp group and since he was in Shillong decided to meet up with him and learn more about their work. Like many others (including the govt), I thought the organisation was run by the church, but this is not the case. The NGO has an amazing campus in the heart of shillong where they run a school, small farm (for training purposes) and a livelihood/skilling center. The organisation focusses on Community Based Inclusive Development (CBID) approach to promote accessible environments to facilitate the mainstreaming of disability. School was not in session, so the campus was relatively quiet. Seems like it will be buzzing with activity when students are in the hostel and school is in session. They also have another location in Tura which is equally big and vibrant.
SauraMandala Foundation
Definitely my most interesting and different meeting. Karthik and his team have come across a very unique model (at least to me), where they have managed to demonstrate and pilot a few initiatives which have then been adopted by the state government. They do an amazing job co-creating with the community, collaborating with other NGOs, and then partnering with the state government to take this to scale. They’ve already done this for a few projects:
Chief Ministers Youth Centers
– Building a center for adolescents and youth to develop different skills in different areas across the state. In collaboration with Project Defy
Contextual Books for Kid
s – In collaboration with Pratham books
Solar Panels for Health Care Centers – In collaboration with SELCO Foundation
Rural entrepreneurship program
– rainmatter co-funded fellowship
So while their core operating budget is approx 2-3 CR, the State Government invests another 15-16 CR to take these projects to scale. This is an amazing achievement of bringing together the community, specialized NGOs and the government to do things at scale. We continued the conversation and my education with a really nice meal at
Rynsan Shillong
.
Grassroot Shillong
I met Mayfereen at their offices in Upper Shillong, where Google Maps in its infinite wisdom wanted us to drive up a staircase. My education continued with her as she explained to me that while Meghlaya is a matri-lineal state (i.e. property passes down to the youngest daughter in the family, who has to take care of the parents), it is still a very patriarchal society, where the maternal uncle plays an influential role. The NGO works with communities from an indigenous rights and gender perspective, which means they involve everyone in the community in a very close manner to make collaborative decisions that impact the community. This process will take a much longer time, but the adoption of this by the community in general is a lot stronger. She was patient enough to explain to me all this in great detail, while I pestered her with lots of questions (she was warned about this, by folks at dasra before we met!)
SeSTA
I did not meet the folks at SeSTA (did not spend time in Gauhati), but spoke with Manash (ex-SeSTA) and had an amazing
assamese thali lunch
with Ritika who I got to know via the Data Catalyst Program (yes, food plays an important role in my meetings!). SeSTA was one of the first NGOs that we worked with for Tech4Dev 1.0 and has a special place in my heart. The conversation revolved around the importance of data and tech and veered into what we (i.e.
Project Tech4Dev
) could do in the regionTitle: Mid Quarter Tech4Dev Update – In the media, podcast and events

==================================================

This is an atypical update, since it comes mid-quarter. We’ve had a bit of good news and publicity for Tech4Dev and Glific that we’d like to share with youbefore the next update in the 1st week of October.
In the short span of 15 months, Glific has gone from being an idea to becoming a
Global Digital Public Good.
The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative (endorsed by the UN and spearheaded by Norway & Unicef) with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.
My journey in the social sector from funding to neck-deep involvement, along with highly biased opinions and thoughts can be heard on the
No-Cast extension podcast
with Deval from Dasra. I’ve known Deval and Neera for decades now, and I am happy to blame them for my involvement in the sector. A worthwhile listen (maybe at 2x speed to save time!) especially if you are in the social sector and/or thinking of getting involved.
We were recently featured in YourStory (the TechCrunch of India) in their social stories section:
How this San Francisco-headquartered open-source platform is providing a chatbot to NGOs
We were also featured in NextBillion:
Rethinking Community Connectivity: As the Pandemic Wears On, NGOs Turn to Technology for Information Dissemination and Behaviour Change
Tech4Dev in partnership with

is facilitating the technology day section of the
Resilience Strategy for NonProfits Course
Thank you for all your support and help. Please continue spreading the word, letting other folks know about
Tech4Dev
and
Glific
and making introductions to folks whenever possible. Our combined efforts will help us build a strong, supportive and sustainable ecosystem.

==================================================

?Hi everyone, My name is Shreesh, I’m currently working as a software development engineer at Maverick Labs, Pune.  I was introduced to the Glific platform in mid-March 2021, wherein I was asked to attend a webinar on Glific to get started and to get an overall idea for the same.
Starting with April 1, I got introduced to the Glific development team in their daily stand-up meeting. At the start, things felt a bit complicated since it was my first time working with a team of this capacity( I usually worked with a team of not more than 4) and overall project.  Then we had team orientation with Dignesh, and he then helped me to set up the project and briefing on the codebase. Then I took some time understanding and exploring web-app and code. Shortly after that, I got assigned the first issue for design enhancement. This is how my journey was started with the Glific.
Following are few things I liked about the Glific team:
Daily standups, weekly milestones, and fast-paced working.
Active community on discord for help and support on both technical and non-technical front.
People here are enthusiastic and passionate about their work.
People commend you here for your work.
There’s pretty much more than this but wanted to cut it short. This is my first time working with an open-source project, seeing people using it, and giving feedback for the same. I’m glad that I got the opportunity to work with these intellectual people, who strive hard to make this platform better. Also special thanks to Lobo for always encouraging and motivating.Title: More collaboration through Glific sprints

==================================================

Early morning on Sunday, September 11, I and Shamoon left Tehri for the three-hour bike trip to Dehradun for another
Tech4Dev
sprint. This sprint was in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas in Dehradun from
The Sal Woods Forest Retreat & Spa
which is amidst serene natural greenery
On reaching Dehradun, we met Vivek and Mohit and took a cab to the
Sal Wood Resort
, where we waited for the rest of the party to join.
This sprint was divided into two parts: the first two days were focused on the
Tech4Dev
community consisting of partners like
HyperVerge Academy
,
Aam Digital
,
Dasra
,
Dhwani RIS
,
Avni
,
Soft Corner
, and
IDInsight
; the next three days were focused on
Glific
NGO partners and the developing the new Data platform.
As NGO partners (
Indus Action
,
Reap Benefit
,
STiR Education
,
The Apprentice Project
,
VOPA
,
Key Education Foundation
,
Quest Alliance
,
Suno Sunao
,
Gram Vaani
, and
Bhumi
) joined us on the evening of 13 September, we had a quick introductory session and celebrated the wins that have been enabled by the use of technology and
Glific
platform.
Read more about the introductory session and what each NGO shared in Tejass
blog
On the next two mornings, we had a roundtable discussion with them where they shared their learning so far and the challenges they are facing and trying to overcome while implementing the technology.
These sessions were really helpful in understanding the work different NGOs do and how they use Glific in their solutions which brings a new paradigm of perspective for us developers of how each feature is looked upon from the eyes of NGOs and how it solves their use case. This certainly gives us a few pointers for the Glific features roadmap, the features we need to build, and the areas we can improve on to extend existing functionalities in a way it is more flexible to use for greater impact.
Some of the areas of collaboration that came up through the roundtable with the NGOs and things we are looking forward to were
Vandana from
Bhumi
shared how they needed an effective way to manage collections in
Glific
using Google Sheets so that a list of contacts may be added to a collection using Sheets rather than manually adding each contact one at a time. To automate this functionality, we are currently considering Apps Script.
On the day 2 session, Sheetal from
Key Education Foundation
shared how they are using
Glific
to interact with parents. Where weekly activities for parents are shared in the form of worksheets from a chatbot, in addition to Chatbot, parents, and mentors can communicate more directly in a private WhatsApp group. She also added how they are currently looking for ways for more engagement in the bot as parents are more comfortable with chatting in WhatsApp groups than with Chatbot and how nudges and more personalized messages could be possible ways to engage parents more with the bot. We are eager to start on these two fronts in the upcoming weeks.
We recently wrapped up POC work in the R mapping dashboard with
Reap Benefit
. Check out more about our work in this
blog
. In this sprint along with Tejas and Gautam from
Reap Benefit
, we met Ankit who is currently working with
Reap Benefit
as part of the fractional CXO initiative of Tech4Dev. We all sat together and discussed the work done so far, how we can improve in the future, planned next milestones, and how this feature can be generalized for other NGOs.
These sprints help in understanding the problems each organization is trying to solve and help in deepening partnerships across organizations. It’s wonderful to see so many like-minded individuals get together to exchange ideas, looking forward to the next sprint which is planned for the week of Dec 11th – Dec 16th in Pondicherry. See you all thereTitle: More conversations with our NGO Partners

==================================================

Last week (the week of 2
nd
Sep) we talked with the rest of the cohort 1 grantees ? Lakeer, The Read Project, Hasiru Dala, HAQ, and Spandan – about their experiences with Tech4Dev and with their respective software partners. We had talked with the rest of the grantees earlier and a blog post detailing highlights from those conversations is here –
https://chintugudiya.org/tech4dev-ngo-feedback/
While these new conversations reiterated the points coming out in the last round of conversation, on communication, role definitions, both the NGO partner and the software partner doing more research on each other, and the need for building technology capacity of the NGOs,  some of the newer insights that came out of last week?s conversations are as follows:
Coordination and project management can be improved ? While the NGOs and the software partners are on the same page on most projects now, some of the initial hiccups in understanding deliverables, timelines, and milestones could have been reduced if both parties had had a clearer picture of the level of time and effort commitments from their side.
Also, while the primary coordination is between the software partner and the NGO, a need was also expressed for Tech4Dev to be present within the coordination and update environment in some form. We need to think more on structuring the operational role of Tech4Dev in the regular interactions between software partners and NGOs for the second cohort.
Timelines need to have some buffer built in ? We need to communicate to the NGOs in cohort 2 that solution development is an iterative process and is often a process involving multiple rounds of development, refinement, testing. Nevertheless, given that the NGOs will be working with software partners for the first time, we could do with some buffer in estimating timelines and project duration.
Important for both software partners and NGOs to be responsive to each other ? It would be good to have some sort of guideline for both partners to respond to each other?s communication within 48 hours. Responding need not mean acting on requests but coming back with feasibility and/or time needed to take action. Would also help greatly in points 1 and 2, above.
Expectations on skills ? We heard some comparisons between solutions developed for NGO partners and more expensive commercially available software. For cohort 2, it would be a good idea to set expectations on the skill set of software partners and the nature of solution development being undertaken for the grantees. The one-pager template each software partner, to be shared with all the cohort grantees is a good first step in making that happen.
Hand-holding post solution deployment and project duration ? We also heard a few requests for allowing tech support by the software partners after the solution has been deployed and even beyond the original duration of the project. Extension of length of engagement was also a frequently requested input. For cohort 2, we either put some thought into the feasibility of such an approach or make very clear in our communications on why this is not feasible.Title: My 3 months journey

==================================================

This blog is written by Ankit Saxena,
Fractional CxO at
Reap Benefit
and
Indus Action
through Tech4Dev
It has been 3 months since I joined the
Tech4Dev
group. I think its a good time to review my journey so far and share my experiences.
When I was joining the Tech4Dev group I had detailed conversations with Lobo and Erica about the group, programs, and different ongoing projects. I had the option to either join one of the platforms or to start work in the fractional CxO program. Lobo recommended that I should start my journey from fractional CxO program so that I get an opportunity to deeply understand the work that NGOs do and their challenges with tech. Indeed, the past 3 months have been a great experience for me and definitely they help in setting the right base and understanding of the social development sector.
My work in the fractional CxO program started with two wonderful NGOs, with supercharged people, and teams. I wasnt very sure of how to best manage the work and break my week between the two NGOs, given the fact that I didnt have a fair idea about the scope of work and the ground challenges. So we decided to let me spend a month with each NGO dedicatedly and then come up with a plan in the 3rd month.
I started my first month with NGO A. My initial conversations with this NGO started with very clear and specific delivery goals. There were 3 different products on which the NGO wanted help in feature development. Also as part of my one-month engagement, another objective that we set was to have a tech strategy and roadmap document for the next 3-6 months (at least).
The first month with Tech4Dev was very intense and exciting. I got an opportunity to attend the sprint organized in Dehradun. It was great meeting people from different NGOs and listening to their journeys and how they have been using tech and their future plans. This sprint also helped me understand the overall ecosystem and also build some personal connections.
Coming back to NGO A, I super liked the work – it was designing systems and coding (things that I love the most). In the first month, we were able to push out the majority of the features that we had planned. I also got a chance to understand and learn
Frappe
. While keeping an eye on the weekly to-dos and deliverables, I started some conversations with the team on the tech strategy and the roadmap. Overall a great month – good learning, able to deliver the majority of the features, met some exceptional folks, and got a chance to understand NGOs work at a deeper level.
Month 2 started with changing with focus on NGO B. Here instead of specific feature delivery, the need and focus were more on the execution of projects, building products, and ensuring that seemingly different tech initiatives align with the broader vision and objectives of the organization. I took a holistic view of the tech team structure and how it fits into the NGOs overall systems and processes. As a result, we reorganized the team structure, opened new hiring positions, reprioritized tech initiatives, and paused a few. I am sure that this helps set the right base and practice to build and execute the technology strategy.
At the end of month 2, a very different thought process and sense emerged. NGOs A and B – both having different needs and challenges. While one has a clear vision and an org/ tech roadmap it needs help in execution, and another needs a clear tech strategy and vision to be developed. It was time to create a structure and plan on how to divide my week between these 2 NGOs, and what the deliverables would be. I also saw that we as the Tech4Dev group are expanding and had a couple of open positions that needed to be filled. I had some experience in hiring and engaging an agency to fast-track the overall process. Therefore I also decided to mark out some time to support hiring.
Finally, I created a structure and weekly schedule to divide my time between NGO A and B, and also some time for setting up the hiring agency. Also created a monthly delivery plan for both NGOs. So far I have been able to stick to the schedule. But for sure I would be revisiting it in the upcoming months.
As for hiring, it was easy for me to reach out to a couple of agencies but slightly challenging to help them understand the whole Tech4Dev ecosystem. Thanks to Erica who helped join some conversations and set the right context. We have finally onboarded an agency to help us with recruitment. It was interesting (and time-consuming, but a necessary process) to get the agency onboarded (in terms of the agreement, approvals, etc). This also gave me an opportunity to set up the whole application tracker on Notion (thanks to Vinod for his idea).
Some of the key learnings and challenges in these 3 months  –
Data collection is easy but ensuring that an NGO is able to drive the relevant metrics for decision-making remains challenging. One of the NGOs has been doing surveys and data collection using different tools. But a lack of a clear tech strategy and thought process on data pipeline and visualization tools has made the situation challenging. This aspect is one of the top priorities to be handled.
Integrating systems that have been built by different vendors, at different times and for different purposes is a challenge in itself.
Not having the necessary technical expertise to ensure that the technical design of a software application (either being developed or being procured) supports the envisioned use cases or the realization of the intended benefits. A good case in point is the execution of the highest priority strategic product for one of the NGOs. While we review the tech design, some gaps have surfaced that will need to be filled sooner
Not having the necessary expertise to evaluate different software applications and to do build vs buy analysis. Also, not doing a thorough analysis of the need, users’ expectations, and requirements is another challenge that I discovered with one of the NGOs hasty decision in purchasing a license for a project management tool that had to be put off in just 2 months.
Overcommitting and saying yes to each and every opportunity, without factoring in the tech capacity
Over-exposure of developers to roles such as product manager and/or project manager
No clear product strategy and design
And last but the most important one – lack of clear organization strategy and then trying to fire up tech engines. Tech strategy is derived from a solid organization strategy which gets formed when an organization clearly sets out a goal that it needs to achieve in a specific period of time (ensuring that the goal aligns with the organizations mission/vision statement)
Overall a great journey so far. Super excited when I look forward to it. I am thankful for the support the overall Tech4Dev group and the ecosystem provided me. Special mention of Lobo and Erica for their mentoring, guidance, and support, and for helping me with the nuances of working as a fractional CxO.Title: My Experience Attending a Tech4Dev Sprint cum Dasra Annual Offsite at Karjat, Mumbai

==================================================

As a regular attendee of office events, I’m used to having my calendar fully blocked, with no time to do anything else apart from attending the sessions. But my recent experience attending a Tech4Dev Sprint was different, and for the better.
During the first two sprints (Goa and Jaipur) I wasn’t sure how to make the most of my time. But after attending two Sprints and my third one at Karjat, Mumbai, I got the hang of it and appreciated the flexibility that allowed me to work on my regular tasks while attending the sessions.
One of the highlights of the Tech Sprint was the session with the Dasra Team. We talked about the platforms and services that Tech4Dev has, and at the end asked the Dasra programs teams to think about the challenges they have and if any of the solutions Tech4Dev has can solve them. To provide additional support, we allocated one Tech4Dev team member to each table (each table had one program team). Having one member of the Tech4Dev team assigned to each table helped the Dasra team to ask questions and think through the challenges and possible tech solutions. This session was incredibly productive, and it helped me feel more connected to the Dasra Team and passionate about the work that they’re doing.
In fact, I was so inspired that I spoke with Erica, the India Head of Project Tech4Dev, about the possibility of volunteering one day a month to help them navigate their technical challenges. Many of their problems don’t even require sophisticated solutions and could be solved using tools like Google Forms or WhatsApp communities, etc.
Tech4Dev Introduction Session with Dasra Team
Another session that stood out to me was the one on how to come up with a dashboard, conducted by Swapneel Rane, the founder of Goalkeep. It provided a useful framework for asking the right questions to reach the dashboard that we want to see.
Aside from the productive sessions, the unstructured fun time towards the end of the day was also helpful for bonding with the team. The karaoke and DJ night organized by the team provided a much-needed break from the work.
Team Picture After Bowling
Overall, attending the Tech4Dev Sprint with the Dasra Team was a great experience. The flexible schedule, joint sessions, and useful sessions made it a productive and enjoyable event. I’m looking forward to attending more of these sprints in the future.Title: My Experience at AALI

==================================================

Introduction:
For individuals engaged in remote work, maintaining discipline can prove challenging. Personally, I found it increasingly difficult after some consecutive days confined to my home without much external interaction.
Upon discussing my need for a change with Erica and Lobo, they suggested the idea of working from one of our partner NGOs’ offices. This would not only allow me to diversify my work environment but also provide an opportunity to contribute to the NGOs’ activities and gain insights into ground operations. Despite Lobo extending this offer multiple times before, I hadn’t considered it seriously until now, and I decided to seize the opportunity.
Choosing AALI:
Lobo provided me with a list of NGOs affiliated with the Dasra network in Lucknow, and after reviewing my options, I chose AALI primarily because of its proximity to my home and the commitment to women’s rights aligned with my interests, making it a fitting choice. Recognizing the effort involved in arranging this option for me, I committed to dedicating my time for two to three months, working three days a week. This arrangement allowed me to contribute meaningfully without overcommitting, considering the uncertainties of my workload and schedule.
Initial Impressions:
On November 1st, I stepped into
AALI
for the first time. Welcomed by Sonali, she gave me a tour of the office, introducing me to the dedicated teams working towards women’s empowerment. I really liked the room I was being assigned. It was a room filled with books, creating a conducive work environment.
Understanding AALI’s Mission:
I met with Renu, the Executive Director of AALI, who provided insights into AALI’s mission, revolving around three key strategies: Access to Justice, Active Citizenship, and Addressing Knowledge Gaps for women. AALI’s ideology resonated with the powerful quote: “Feminism isn’t about making women stronger. Women are already strong; it’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength”
by G.D. Anderson.
At the end she said: Yahan aaye ho to aadha lawyer to hum tumhe bana denge. If you have come here in our midst, we’ll mold you into half a lawyer, which I am hoping that I become more aware of our laws.
Engaging in Educational Sessions:
During the initial days, possibly on the first or second day, there was a session organized for psychology students from Lucknow University, which I attended. The focus of the session was to elucidate the provisions of the POCSO Act, enacted in 2012 following the Nirbhaya case.
The session delved into intricate details, explaining the components of the law, the various categories of sexual offenses under POCSO, and the corresponding punishments. It emphasized the importance of clarifying the law’s language to understand it better.
Living in a seemingly blissful world can sometimes blind us to the harsh realities of society, prompting contemplation on how to contribute to its improvement. In a room filled with girls, a poignant moment arose when the question about experiencing harassment was posed, and to everyone’s dismay, each had a story to share. This stark realization prompts reflection on the state of our society.
Amidst this, Renus words served as a source of encouragement. Her advice to confront such situations boldly, delivering a resounding slap metaphorically, resonated stronglymaking it clear that silence only emboldens wrongdoers.
Furthermore, the session shed light on inheritance laws, revealing that I have an equal right to my grandfather’s property, akin to my father’s entitlement. (I dont know why I remember this)
Other engagements:
They actively organize awareness sessions in multiple states to ensure that women are well-informed about their rights. The office sees a daily influx of individuals seeking discussions on pertinent issues. From my perspective, it’s evident that the team is wholeheartedly dedicated and exerting every effort to address these crucial matters.
Contributing Beyond Tech:
Feeling a sense of responsibility to contribute more than just occupying space, I offered assistance beyond my core expertise. From troubleshooting hardware issues to editing videos using iMovie, I found ways to actively support AALI’s ongoing initiatives in some way.
AALIs 25th Anniversary Event Day Reflections:
I was entrusted with the role of Technical Support for the event, overseeing the setup of presentations and ensuring everything ran smoothly. This responsibility granted me front-row access to each presentation, allowing me to absorb the impactful moments of the day.
While I won’t delve into the exhaustive details of the event, I want to spotlight a few key moments that left a lasting impression:
Naghma Mulla (CEO, Edelgive)
addressed the pervasive issue of sarcastic jokes directed at women. She eloquently recounted instances where she encountered stereotypes, such as assumptions about women’s proficiency in mathematics or their ability to drive. Her insights shed light on the prevailing biases that women face.
Jab mai CA karne gayi tab mujhe pata chala ki ladkiyon ko math nahi aati
Jab mai car chalane gyi tab mujhe pata chala ki ladkiyon ko car chalana nahi aata.
Social sector me aayi h to aaram wala kaam karne aayi hogi
Renu Mishra (Executive Director, AALI)
passionately advocated for allowing women the choice to be seen as individuals rather than being confined to societal expectations of either being deified as goddesses or relegated to the status of servants. Her call for recognizing the inherent humanity in women and according them the respect they deserve resonated deeply.
Hame ya to devi bana diya jaata hai ya daasi. Hume insaan hi rehne do aur insanon ka darja dedo
Renuka Mishra (DG-Training)
shared poignant accounts of the challenges women encounter in police services and her proactive efforts to improve conditions within the system. Her commitment to driving positive change in a traditionally male-dominated field was truly inspiring.
Tulika Srivastav’s (founder, AALI)
dedication to creating a safe and supportive space for women to share their experiences was commendable. Her initiative in establishing AALI reflected a commitment to empowering women through open dialogue.
Additionally, I was struck by the recurring theme of women acknowledging the pivotal role of their fathers in their journeys. It reminded me of the ongoing debate in my own home about parental affections, with some playfully asserting that fathers favor daughters and mothers favor sonsa dynamic that seemed to transcend cultural boundaries.
Conclusion:
After a month at AALI, I am inspired by the dedication of the team and their commitment to uplifting women. Moving forward, I aim to explore additional ways to contribute through the initiatives of Tech4dev. This experience has not only broadened my understanding of social issues but also strengthened my resolve to be part of positive change.Title: My Experience with Tech4Dev

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/my-experience-with-tech4dev/
==================================================

After a long tenure in the corporate tech sector, I felt a strong urge to explore opportunities in the social sector and make a meaningful contribution to society. I was fortunate to connect with Lobo from Tech4Dev, which marked the beginning of my journey. He shared a wealth of informative reading materials and contacts that greatly contributed to enhancing my overall understanding of the social sector. I spoke with numerous individuals within this sector to help inform my decision about making a transition to this field. I was truly inspired by the vision and mission of Tech4Dev, leading me to take the role of fractional CxO with the organization.
I consider myself fortunate to have joined the Organization just in time for their quarterly team sprint at Karjat, Mumbai. During this event, I had the privilege to interact with a majority of the team members, which provided me with invaluable insights into their distinct programs and functional areas. Moreover, I took the opportunity to establish personal connections with the team members.
First fCxO Engagement
My initial experience as an fCxO was with an NGO, an organization dedicated to Grassroot Leadership Development, Women Empowerment and other initiatives. In this role, I collaborated with my colleague Piyali, who was also concurrently supporting another NGO. Her guidance was immensely valuable in facilitating my rapid adaptation to the fCxO program and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the associated processes.
During the first month of engagement, we conducted numerous meetings with organization executives and the management team to gain a comprehensive overview of the organization and a thorough understanding of each of their programs. I was truly astonished by the impactful work being carried out by the NGO at the grassroots level. Through extensive discussions, we identified three key programs and technological requirements that needed to be prioritized within the scope of this engagement.
We devised a solid action plan for the upcoming two months to address these key technological requirements and visited the NGO to conduct a comprehensive review with the leadership team. I was filled with immense excitement during this first site visit. We actively participated in meaningful discussion with the program teams and devoted most of our time in deeper understanding of the program implementation and field challenges in the key projects. This visit played a crucial role in fostering a strong relationship and establishing a personal connection with the team. It was heartening to see the passion and dedication of the field team.
Following our visit, we embarked on addressing the key technological requirements. I closely collaborated with a vendor who had supplied a case management application to the NGO, which was experiencing issues. I reviewed the list of outstanding problems and actively engaged with the application’s functionalities. Multiple meetings were conducted with the vendor to tackle critical issues and streamline the process of issue reporting and tracking. Concurrently, we initiated in-depth discussions about their flagship program for digitization. Extensive sessions were held with the program lead and the team to craft the product requirement document. Additionally, efforts were directed towards defining the IT internal tool requirements and coordinating with tool vendors for a demo. Due to the absence of technical expertise and the program team’s heavy workload with field engagements, a significant amount of time had to be dedicated to follow-up efforts.
Impressions of Udaipur Sprint
I was privileged to attend another sprint hosted in Udaipur where all the integral partners of the ecosystem  including NGOs, funders, software vendors, designers, interns as well as finance & accounting members  converged under one roof. It was very refreshing to connect people in-person. The sprint was highly concentrated, with the five verticals of Tech4Dev (Glific, Data Platform, Fractional CxO, Avni, Finance & Management) each having their distinct agendas and schedules. We had a deep dive of the fCxO program, during which each fractional CxO shared their unique engagement experiences, emphasizing the importance of learning and building relationships with NGOs. It was a good insight on the fCxO program.
Conclusion
I truly commend the Tech4Dev team for their unwavering passion and dedication to the development sector. The organization functions with the agility of a startup, skilfully led by the dynamic leadership of Lobo and Erica. This journey has been truly remarkable, characterized by significant learning and insights into the development sector. My understanding of free open source software and tools has been enriched through this experience, and I have also gained valuable insights into operating effectively within constraints. I am truly inspired by the individuals in this field and the remarkable opportunities to make a positive impact.
I express my gratitude to the entire Tech4Dev team for their unwavering support, and truly thankful to Lobo for his consistent guidance, which has been immensely valuable.Title: My First Sprint in Bangalore with Tech4Dev

==================================================

Written By:- Himanshu (Dalgo)
Hi, Himanshu here. I recently joined the Tech4Dev (Dalgo team) as a software developer. Before joining Dalgo, I worked with tech startups for around two years. Mhd Shamoon, a senior developer at Tech4Dev, is the reason I joined T4D this time and also why I couldn?t join Dalgo last year (thanks to his habit of ignoring WhatsApp messages and now Discord messages too).
I joined the team this July, and this was my first team sprint in Bangalore and my first time meeting everyone in person. It was also my first time taking a flight and visiting Bangalore, so my excitement was at its peak. On the morning of the 16th, I landed in Bangalore. I loved the weather, but the traffic was a different story!
I headed directly to WeWork, where I met Siddhant (Data Engineer at Dalgo). He gave me a warm introduction to the company and the project. Later, Shamoon joined us, and at night we met the Agency Fund people (huge thanks to Sid for getting me in there). I also met Abhishek Nair (Product Manager at Dalgo) later that night?a professional as well as a friendly person.
The next two days were similar, and I met Ashwini (Lead at Dalgo). We had a chat about her visit to Uttarakhand and my hometown, Bageshwar.
Serious Business Starts
?Day 17
The 17th and 18th were the core reason for the sprint. We had a meet-up with NGOs already using our Dalgo platform and those interested in exploring Dalgo to suit their needs.
The day started well as I got my laptop from Rohit (Manager at Dalgo). He was so occupied with so many things that our only interaction was when I asked him for my VaultWarden credentials.
The business began with Abhishek Nair giving a brilliant presentation about Dalgo, sparking curiosity among the new NGOs about the product and its use cases. Some of the notable NGOs present were The Apprentice Program (TAP), Noora Health, Goonj, Arghyam, Udhyam, CHMLP, Arogya Health, GoalKeep, and KEF. All of them are doing great work in their respective fields.
I was paired with Ishan (Senior Developer at Dalgo). The understanding and clarity I got from listening to him explain Dalgo to the NGOs were unparalleled. He knows the product inside and out. As my assigned buddy, we had some serious work and serious fun together.
Understanding the NGOs, their work, and their challenges with handling data helped me grasp the Dalgo platform better. I sought feedback from the NGOs about the platform, and the one thing everyone mentioned was the user-friendly UI (UI4T). People from different fields and backgrounds were initially hesitant about understanding and using the product. However, they not only understood the product but also performed some cool data quality tests and transformations. I was really happy to be part of such a great product.
Day 18
The day started with Ashwini presenting Dalgo?s Quarterly Review. The cross-questioning and Ashwini?s clear responses were the highlights of that review. Then began the consulting work with the NGOs, and the day ended well with all NGOs being happy and satisfied with the resolutions to their queries. We got some great feedback from all the NGOs.
These were two of the most enlightening days of my life.
Fun After Work
Every evening, I met some great people during dinner or at the hotel. Apart from India, I met? folks from Africa (Osumane), Taiwan (Linus), Austria (Ashwin), and more. We visited some fantastic restaurants, enjoyed crispy dosa, great filter coffee, and other delicious delicacies. The early morning breakfast at CTR with Lobo and team will be missed.
In conclusion, my first sprint with Tech4Dev in Bangalore was a memorable blend of learning, networking, and fun. I?m excited about what lies ahead and grateful for the experience.
P.S. There are some great slides regarding Dalgo Support in the Quarterly Review PowerPoint. They are hidden for some reason, but one should refer to them to gain great insights????.Title: My First Sprint: Shillong Stories and the Tech4Dev Way

==================================================

Imagine this: just one year into my journey in India, still acclimating to the vibrant colors, sounds, and quirks of South India, when an opportunity arises to venture into the far-flung, rain-soaked, and almost mystical Northeast for my first company sprint with Tech4Dev. To Shillong—a place I’d dreamt of visiting—nestled in the hills of Meghalaya, steeped in mist and mystery. It was to be a week of discovery, camaraderie, and unforgettable moments. Not only was this my first sprint, but it was also an unexpected leap into the heart of a company I was just beginning to know.
Landing at Guwahati Airport, the excitement of being able to meet everyone I had worked with remotely hit me hard! Joining the Sprint Planning team with Radhika and Pritesh felt like returning to old roots but in a new, exciting form. With a past life in student councils and event organizing—from international Model United Nations to inter-university debate championships—I had always loved being part of events that bring people together. Volunteering for sprint planning, even without any prior sprint experience at T4D, felt like the right kind of challenge.
Radhika, a true veteran, guided us, and together we spun ideas into action: Sprint Bingo, the Scavenger Hunt, improv games for team-building, scheduling, excursions, and custom mugs. Each detail was refined over multiple rounds until it became something we could all be proud of. From day one, it was clear that this wasn’t just another work trip; it was a venture into the soul of Tech4Dev.
Then came the hackathon—a highlight of the sprint. Working on
OnboardMate
was a joy—an idea born from my desire to streamline parts of my own work, to automate the repetitive and routine. Collaborating with Jerome and Rohit was a masterclass in tech wizardry. Jerome—who could code with the dexterity of a concert pianist using Vim, no IDE in sight—was inspiring in his retro approach. Rohit, our Head of Engineering, turned everything into an adventure. With the kind of chaotic, electric energy only he possesses, he spurred us on, once even declaring that we would be the winners—and turns out, we were! Together, we built a tool that was more than just a sprint hack; it was a solution to enhance our workflows. Thanks to their help and support, we snagged both the
Technical Wizardry
and
Overall Championship
awards.
Outside the hackathon, the trip was filled with moments that made it special. One unforgettable night, we celebrated Erica’s anniversary with us, filling the evening with energy as we dressed in festive attire and danced to classic desi hits. Having missed my family’s annual dandiya celebration this year, this night made up for it tenfold. From the laughter to the music to just letting loose with the team, it was a night that felt like home away from home.
Meeting Lobo, the visionary behind Tech4Dev, was another memorable part of the trip. His dedication to the sector, to creating visible impacts for clients, was both inspiring and energizing. One morning, I set out on a long walks with Lobo, Rajeev and Thomas, testing the limits of my fitness on the steep inclines as the mist lifted to reveal sweeping landscapes. We talked about work, plans, ideas—or simply let the quiet be our companion. It was clear how much Lobo cares about the team, the clients, and the broader purpose that guides our work. In addition, being surrounded by such fitness enthusiasts, hearing about the insane number of kilometers they walked everyday (looking at you Thomas) was immensely motivating!
And then there were the excursions—each one as unforgettable as the last. Hiking to Laitlum Canyon, I felt a sense of profound smallness amidst the stunning expanse of nature. The vastness left me humbled and a little breathless, both from the climb and the sweeping beauty around. Devi kept me company as we ventured off the beaten path, mingling with horses, almost wanting to get lost! Gaming nights with Siddhant, Shamoon, Ishan, and Nair (where I got to flex my skills as Baraka in Mortal Kombat) were filled with shenanigans and laughter. Including strolling through the bustling Police Bazaar late into the night, each experience added something special to the journey.
One evening, we went to a club to hear
Never End
, a phenomenal band from Upper Shillong, play covers of classic rock songs. Rohit proved to be the life of the party, leading the charge on the dance floor to “Sweet Child o’ Mine” and “It’s My Life.” For a moment, we were not colleagues, not tech professionals—just a group of people lost in the music, in the thrum of the night.
Evenings at the hotel bar gave us all a chance to unwind and connect beyond work. Erica, Siddhant, Diana, and Gautam shared stories of meeting their significant others, while Rohit’s eclectic playlist set the vibe as Thomas, Anto, and Nair shared stories about bands I’d never heard of. Each conversation revealed a different layer of the team I was still getting to know—from Krishna, or “KP” as she had been mentioned to me, to Shamoon, Akansha, and Nishika, each of whom I bonded with over a patchwork of topics.
Returning each night to the comfort of the Taj Vivanta was a kind of surprise I hadn’t anticipated. I’d expected a modest stay, maybe a motel. But the Taj’s impeccable service, the food that catered perfectly to my diet, and of course, the cheesecake—which I may have indulged in once (or twice) too many—made me feel spoiled. My roommate, Sangeeta, was the cherry on top—teaching me dance moves, sharing stories, and laughing off my night-owl tendencies even when I’d be up typing away at the laptop as she slept. She was a joy to share the space with, even apologizing to me the day she got sick!
A big part of the sprint was the feeling of being truly supported. During the retrospective, everyone took the time to reflect not just on what we’d accomplished but on how we could improve. I walked away with more than just new ideas for the next steps—I gained a bird’s-eye view of Tech4Dev’s future and the role I could play in it. I felt like my happiness and my growth, mattered here, and that made me feel more productive, more motivated than ever. Every interaction, every laugh, every bug solved, every song sung, and every game played added layers to my experience here.
I came back not only with memories but with a newfound sense of belonging and purpose. As I look forward to future sprints, I know now that it’s more than just the work. It’s the people, the shared memories, the laughter, and the challenges that make it all meaningful. Here’s to many more moments like these, to more sprints, and to the team that turned Shillong from a mere destination into a home away from home.
Tech4Dev envisions a world where a robust technology ecosystem empowers the social sector. By focusing on open-source and affordable solutions, we address the technological and data disparities prevalent in the nonprofit sector, fostering collaboration and innovation for lasting social change.Title: My First Tech4Dev Sprint

EMPATHY
I recently attended my first-ever sprint organized by
Tech4Dev
in Goa, a place where people from diverse ethnic backgrounds live in harmony and speak their own dialects. Given its pluralist roots, I feel it was the perfect location to bring together all the NGOs. It was very inspiring to learn about the impact these organizations are trying to create in different areas like early childhood education (
Key Education Foundation
), spreading awareness about non-communicable diseases (
Arogya World
), vocational education (
LAHI
), helping children from conflict areas to have a relevant positive childhood education (
Shiksharth
), enabling youth from vulnerable sections of society to inculcate the 21st-century skills (
Quest Alliance
,
The Apprentice Project
), etc. The one thing I found that was common across all these organizations and the people working in them, was Empathy. Empathy in everything they do right from their work to talking to a software engineer (me) who does not understand what actually happens on the field. With empathy, I believe it becomes very easy to collaborate & share best practices which is what these sprints are all about – collaboration, strengthening relationships, and reflection.
PRINCIPLES
On our second day of the sprint, we had a more formal introduction with all the members from the team. I was humbled when Lobo shared some of the key principles that are upheld by the people working in Tech4dev
Generosity : Generosity in working with NGOs, helping the ones who are not in position to help themselves.
Transparency: If you have critical feedback about your team member, without hesitation share that. We learn from our mistakes.
Kind: Be kind when you are working with people from the field. They may not understand all the technological jargon.
Tech4Dev
is not only building products that will help nonprofits to amplify their impact but it is also strengthening the ecosystem of software/data engineering companies (Technology partners), NGO partners, and foundations to undertake initiatives to build sustainable solutions. One such recent initiative that I am majorly involved in is building the Development Data Platform for non-profits.
DEVELOPMENT DATA PLATFORM
The idea of this platform stems from the fact that NGOs have loads of data but are not able to maximize the use of it in terms of fetching insights due to various challenges like multiple data sources leading to the complexity of handling them, data quality issues, manual and repetitive synchronization of data, etc. The platform leverages the power of data and open-source tools available to optimize processes & generate actionable insights by pulling and transforming data from multiple sources into a single warehouse. Throughout the sprint, we talked with various organizations to understand their data pipelines and the strategies they currently employ to generate insights. This helped us lay down the foundation of DDP into a Product Requirement Document. I believe the USP of this platform would be the easy-to-use interface that would help NGOs to set up their pipeline with low code to zero code. Hopefully, we will come back with a working prototype to show everyone in the next sprint. Fingers crossed !!!
RELATIONSHIPS
Being an introvert myself, it has always been difficult for me to gel with people. However, the people I met during the sprint were so warm and friendly that it didnt take much time for me to make connections. On the third day of the sprint, we all went parasailing. Piyali, Ankit, and Akhilesh bargained for the price like pros. The orange sky with the sun almost setting, the fresh ocean breeze in our hair, and the salty smell of water made our parasailing experience even more wholesome.
Had very interesting conversations over chai with Sanjeev about how technology has evolved since decades ago when he entered into the software industry to now. Deploying a server is just a piece of cake now as compared to the humongous task it was before. Siddhant and I empathized with each other over the Road not taken in our careers and how we ended up in the development sector. My roommate Arun and I got to know each other over early morning conversations (6 am) about our similar yet varied professional backgrounds. And there were many more such conversations from which I learned a lot about the people that were present there.
HOPE
I look forward to continuing some of the unfinished conversations with some organizations regarding DDP and nurture the connections that I have made here. With a much clearer vision of the Development Data Platform, I am very excited to jump into the development of the platform and figure out the remaining nuances on the architecture of the platform. With the hope that the nonprofit ecosystem becomes a more organized sector and that our ecosystem (NGOs + tech partners + foundations) strengthens as we build sustainable products, I couldnt have asked for a more fulfilling first sprint.Title: My First Tech4Dev – Glific Sprint Sep 2022

Thoughts before Sprint
A few weeks back, my founder(Dr. Prahalathan) and I got a mail from Abhishek from
Glific
about the Sprint happening in September where
Tech4Dev
communities and different NGOs are attending, and we are also invited to join the same. Initially, I was very confused about what this Sprint looked like and whether it was worth attending for my organization or me. When I saw the Sprint Schedule for the first time, I started having thoughts of meeting different people who are working in the same sector and meeting the
Glific
team in
person to understand the system better.
Thoughts while traveling to the Sprint –
I started my journey from Delhi on the Shatabdi Express. Coming to the Sprint for the first time, I was very nervous and had multiple thoughts about meeting new people and taking learnings, key takeaways from the Sprint. I reached the
Salwood resort
in the afternoon, which was surprising to me a resort inside a village surrounded by greenery with a beautiful view which was my home for the next three days.
Sprint Days, 13th Sep- 16th Sep:
The evening started with an ice breaker arranged by Tejas from Reap Benefit, meeting the NGOs(
Indus Action
,
Reap Benefit
,
STiR Education
,
The Apprentice Project
,
VOPA
,
Key Education Foundation
,
Quest Alliance
,
Suno Sunao
,
Gram Vaani
, and
Bhumi
) as well as Tech4Dev communities(
Aam Digital
and
IDInsight
) and understanding about their work and how they have used Glific platform in their Organizations.
It was very interesting to understand the flows people have used in their organizations and the different functionalities of Glific, which can be integrated with Bigquery, Dialog flow, Google ASR, and Exotel. I would personally like to thank the Glific team for having the collaborative support session where we discussed the challenges NGOs faced while working on the platform and what we are expecting more from the Glific team to support.
In the end, we had a reflection session again arranged by Tejas, which was a great success to see where we are today and as a community, how we will be going forward and achieving our goals.
BTW(Behind the Work)
BTW, I enjoyed these days while socializing and wandering around the streets of Sigli , Mussorie and most fun thing to add was Exploding Kittens – a card game which was the heart of the Sprint.
Thoughts after the Sprint :
I am so glad I got the opportunity to attend this Sprint and learn from the different NGOs about their work and see the future of collaboration with
Bhumi
. Additionally, I was able to map some more flows for
Bhumi
and able to work with
Glific
on the challenges we faced in the past. I had a fantastic experience at the sprint and am already excited for the next one in December.
Lastly, I would like to thanks everyone I interacted with in the Sprint and looking forward to collaborate in the future.Title: My Journey with Tech4Dev: Unlocking the Power of Collaboration

By Dawit Taddele Dessie
In today’s interconnected world, technology and collaboration are essential for driving positive social change. My journey with Tech4Dev began in February 2024 when I co-organized the Unconference: Beyond Data, Beyond Borders. This event, held in Nairobi, provided invaluable insights into Tech4Dev’s unique culture and the potential of its solutions for the East African social sector. I was particularly impressed by their commitment to community-centeredness, collaboration, and innovation. Inspired by their approach, I joined Tech4Dev in August of the same year.
Expanding Our Reach: Learning from India’s Scale
Joining Tech4Dev allowed me to focus on expanding our reach in East Africa. By leveraging my prior experience in the region’s social sector, I’ve been able to identify key challenges and opportunities. While the contexts differ, one unique element of the Indian civil society sector is the scale of its engagement. For example, Mumbai alone has 23 million people, while Kenya as a country has 40 million. This offers a unique opportunity for cross-learning, as even the smallest organizations in India interact with large numbers of communities. Take Glific, for example, which is currently being used by over 100 NGOs to reach and engage with 1.3 million people.
The Tech4Dev Ecosystem and Collaboration
Tech4Dev is a unique organization committed to equipping the civil society sector with the tools they need to create lasting social impact. The ecosystem offers a range of solutions designed to transform how nonprofits use technology and data. Collaboration is a cornerstone of Tech4Dev’s approach. We believe in supporting local innovation and acknowledging the agency of communities in solving complex issues. Our partnership with the East Africa Philanthropy Network is a testament to this commitment. By working together, we can share knowledge, resources, and best practices. The most powerful tool we have in addressing social issues is a focus on mutual partnership—on the relationships we build, the language we use, and the way we engage. Through organization-to-organization interactions and a commitment to co-creation, we can drive significant structural and systemic change in the social sector. This approach not only fosters a development model that is more inclusive and equitable but also equips communities to take ownership of their solutions.
The Future of Social Impact
I’m excited about the potential for technology to revolutionize the social sector. By leveraging data and AI, we can identify systemic inequalities and optimize resource allocation. As a member of the Tech4Dev team, I’m looking forward to contributing to our mission. Our upcoming global webinar on September 3 will provide an opportunity to showcase our work on Glific, an AI chatbot builder used by over 100 NGOs. By building strong relationships and tailoring our offerings to the specific needs of East African CSOs, we can create a lasting impact.Title: My Second Glific Sprint!

Introduction
My previous blog was titled My First Glific Sprint, so didnt really crack my brain trying for a fancy title for this one 😛
The more I experience the social sector the more I am amazed by the innovative minds here trying to incorporate the latest technology to serve the community. Glific Sprint is a one stop destination for such bright ideas coming together to share, learn, and grow together.
For those who are not aware of The Apprentice Project (TAP) – we are an organization dedicated to building Social-emotional Learning (SEL) skills in children of the low income community in the age group of 11 to 17 years to develop
21st-century skills and thrive in the world
.
TAP uses its
WhatsApp chatbot (TAP Buddy) – designed, and managed by
Glific developed under Project Tech4Dev
(an open-source, WhatsApp based, two-way communication platform to enable impactful programs to reach communities) – to provide self-learning-based electives to students.
After closely working with the Tech4Dev team for months now, this Sprint was not only an opportunity to learn from other organizations but also to share the exciting projects I had been working on with the team.
And this time we were in The City of Lakes – Udaipur!
Chat GPT Integration
Though this was one of the topics most of the organizations were looking forward to, I think I can without a doubt claim that Akhilesh, and I were the most excited two people in the room. As we sat at the coffee table going through the presentation one last time, Akhilesh asked me why I wasnt preparing, and I said I think my excitement will drive most of what I have to say anyway 🙂
The Problem Statement
It is as simple as – I am a child enrolled in the TAP program, and TAP Buddy is my friend who sends me exciting activities, but when I talk to this friend, and ask questions, she sometimes answers, but sometimes does not, and then asks me to go to my teacher.
In their words TAP Buddy mere sawalon ka jawab h nahi deti!
The solution wasnt as simple, and we along with the Tech4Dev team tried different methods before. With the – if I may call it – revolutionary launch of Chat GPT, we stumbled upon this idea of incorporating it with our chatbot to help solve this problem.
The Glific team helped us set this up via the Jugalbandi APIs which was already using this technique on chatbots. With this setup we could leverage Chat GPTs existing knowledge base, and ML trained setup to customize the same as per our requirements, and then train the same using situational prompts to bring in a customized character in the bot. It would even accommodate, and adjust to the Hindi phonetic language used by the user while asking questions to it. While we are still working on advancements in the setup we have recently rolled it out to some of the teachers who work with the TAP program.
To know more about the setup you can refer to Akhileshs blog:
https://lnkd.in/dJ9rcYDa
One very interesting aspect which by the way we are still testing is the context boundary setup, we want TAP Buddy to answer questions only within the scope of the TAP Program and not almost everything on the face of the earth like Chat GPT, hence this is a very important feature. We saw an initial success in some testing instances as shown below; this journey is still ongoing, and these mini wins keep motivating us, and providing hope.
Example of how we set boundaries in the GPT Integration setup.
DDP & Other Glific features Introduced
We at TAP try to make as many data driven decisions as possible, and in order to do so we need a strong data architecture in the backend. To ensure this, we started working on a pilot with the DDP (
soon to be named Kaapi or Dalgo – there is a tough fight ongoing between the two; my vote is to Dalgo!
) team of Tech4Dev to setup a structured database, and setup transformation, and visualization platform thereafter. This Sprint was an opportunity to also showcase, and share insights from the pilot that we worked on in this regard, and how we plan to move forward.
As usual Tech4Dev team also had a few surprises up their sleeves, and launched a few new features such as Reading and Writing from Google sheets to chatbot flows, Ticketing system, etc. The sprint introduced us to the new The
Glific Mobile App
which is going to make a lot of operational tasks much more efficient for the associated organizations.
Tech4Dev Works Hard, but Parties Harder
Being in Udaipur we did take a stroll across the town to the Monsoon palace, which by the way was the view from our stay, and also experienced some pleasant walks to a nearby lake for sunset.
And how can we forget, after the days full of learning, sharing, working, and networking; we had a super fun karaoke night with everyone singing their hearts out!Title: My experience at Tech4Dev Glific + Avni offsite sprint

==================================================

My first sprint happened in Goa, a place I’ve been wanting to visit for years.Thanks to the Tech4dev team organizing a sprint in Goa, I got to experience it. I’ve only been with the team for a month, so I was pretty anxious before the sprint. I had mixed feelings because I wasn’t sure what a sprint was and how things would unfold.
Arriving at the airport on the 19th, nervousness took over, but meeting welcoming people at the hotel helped calm my nerves. The next day began with an opening circle, allowing me to finally meet the entire team in person. It was a different feeling from our virtual meetings.
Quarterly product reviews for Glific, Avni, Dalgo, and Fcxo followed the opening circle, providing insights into our strengths and areas for improvement. The Techie for Dev award ceremony surprised me with the “budding star” award, despite being a recent addition to the team.
Team-building activities by Outdoors Mantras included the caterpillar walk and roller coaster, although the island activity under the hot sun was less enjoyable. Exploring Goa with my roommate, Akansha, was a delightful experience, especially watching the sunset by the beach.
Educational sessions on important policies by Dinella and Uhanjali followed, shedding light on the principles and regulations of the organization. The ‘Chai pe Charcha’ event, a sales activity to connect with local NGOs, initially made me nervous as the first point of contact. However, meeting and greeting NGOs made me more comfortable, and the event turned out to be a success.
The opening circle with NGOs featured a fun activity, allowing us to connect with new people and learn about their organizations and motivations in the social sector.
Engaging in the Glific sprint and DCP simultaneously, my focus was on Glific. Additionally, I was responsible for social media photography. Sessions covered the auto-translate feature, NGO presentations, and peer learning tables.
The last day included a tech topic by Tejas on LLM vs LLM, providing clarity for someone like me without a tech background. NGO talks introduced me to INREM, Bandhu, and Civis chatbots. A session on the future of the platform gathered ideas from the NGO community. Abhishek Nair gave Glific NGOs the lowdown on Dalgo with a quick presentation.
Post-lunch sessions were tiring, but the 5-minute activities by the team were refreshing and fun. The sprint concluded with a review session, where everyone shared their thoughts.
In the evening, we had a beach party where we could chat casually outside of work. It was awesome seeing Arun singing so enthusiastically during karaoke and really enjoying it. We also had a great time talking and dancing with a lot of people from NGOs.
I’d like to express my gratitude to Lobo for emphasizing the importance of continuous learning. Sharing my experience with him and receiving valuable insights was a great feeling. Erica and Radhika have been supportive since my first day, and having face-to-face discussions with them about my work and overall progress has been enjoyable.
Akhilesh, Shamoon, and Siddhant were always there to help with my minor doubts, creating a space where I felt comfortable asking even the simplest questions without embarrassment. Sangeeta provided valuable insights into support work, helping me understand certain aspects better.
Krishna and Tejas, who were extensively involved in organizing the entire sprint, demonstrated tremendous dedication. I witnessed them working tirelessly from morning till night. It became a running joke to tease Amisha about her morning walks, but there was a surprising day when she even went for a walk.
We also had envelopes with our names on a wall, and everyone had to write a note of appreciation or share their thoughts. Even for this envelope activity, I didn’t anticipate receiving anything. However, when I was on my way back to Delhi, I opened my envelope and read the notes. It felt really special, and some notes were anonymous. Now, I’m curious to find out who wrote what.
The entire sprint was an awesome experience. I learned a lot and met many people, although I couldn’t chat much with some due to their busy schedules. Looking forward to getting to know everyone better in the next sprint.Title: My first time experience at India Foss 3.0

==================================================

Imagine going to your very first Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) event, where you get to represent your organization. That’s exactly what I did at India FOSS, a two-day event filled with learning and meeting amazing people. I was really excited and nervous at the same time.
Everything was really amazing and very new for me.
An Early start of the event
On a nice morning, my team and I headed to India FOSS with a lot of excitement. We reached the event bright and early, ready to dive into the world of FOSS. The day began with breakfast at the venue, but honestly, the food wasn’t great. So, we decided to go out and find something better to eat. This turned out to be a long walk and some fun and also set  a cheerful and light-hearted tone for the day.
Engaging with the amazing communities
When we returned, we had a stall at the event with a TV to showcase our organization. It was interesting to see the different organizations at India FOSS, each working on their own projects and goals.Our stall became a hub for conversations about our work, team, and goals.
We presented our products, namely
Glific
,
Dalgo
, and
Avani
to the people.
I met many people there, and my seniors shared a lot of new insights with me. They gave me advice on how to improve myself and how to explain things more effectively.
One of the best things about FOSS events is meeting all kinds of people. I talked to experienced pros who know a lot about the communities, development and had a lot of experience in this field and also met lots of excited students who want to learn and help out. I told them how they can contribute to our project and all. It was really interesting to see how much each person knew and how creative they were. It was pretty cool. Witnessing the vast pool of knowledge and creativity that each person brought to the table was indeed captivating.
Networking and Learning
During the event, I got involved in interesting conversations, worked together with others to come up with ideas, and had many chances to learn new things. It felt like there were learning opportunities everywhere. We talked a lot, and it was clear that people in the community work well together. There’s a saying that goes way back: “We learn the most when we teach.” This happened to me a lot as I tried to explain our projects to others. It made me understand our work better. Sharing our organization’s journey, insights, and accomplishments was nothing but inspiring.
The event showed me that even casual chats with fellow attendees can be very educational.
Additionally, I learned how to answer various questions from people and explain complex ideas to different audiences. These lessons will be very useful in all my future interactions, whether I’m talking with people in the FOSS community or elsewhere.
Conclusion
My first India FOSS experience was remarkable. It allowed me to dive into the world of Free and Open Source Software, meet amazing people, and represent my company. The event left me inspired and eager to continue my journey in the FOSS community.
If you’ve never been to a FOSS event, I recommend trying it. You’ll be amazed by the friendly community and the wealth of knowledge and experiences waiting for you. India FOSS was just the beginning for me, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next.Title: My first tryst with Tech4Dev – The Shillong Sprint

==================================================

Project Tech4Dev conducts quarterly sprints where the entire team comes together to ideate, collaborate and innovate. The most recent one was conducted at the pretty city of Shillong, in the North East of India. This was my first sprint as part of the team and for me the event was a blueprint of how effective collaboration and team building in an organization should be. What began as an opportunity to align on organizational goals and plans for the future quickly transformed into an immersive journey of learning, team building and adventure that left each and every one of us more connected, both professionally and personally and ensuring that all of us bring out our best for the progress of the organization in its goals of empowering the impact sector with technology.
Contrary to my expectation of hitting a conference hall on Day 1, the first day started with an introduction of all the team members in the scenic setting of Ward’s Lake, Shillong. The initiation of the sprint in a scenic and peaceful open environment set the stage for a week of energetic and thought provoking interactions and social activities that really strengthened the bonds within the team.
The sprint was meticulously planned and executed with adequate time allocated for team discussions, one-on-one catch ups, work times and the icing on the cake was a day-long hackathon where we got our hands dirty with coding. It was a great opportunity for all of us to don our thinking hats from a product perspective and try and build features that could make their way into the product in the future.
The sprint was punctuated with several product based workshops where the team as a whole ideated on product roadmaps and features that could make our offerings more beneficial to the target ecosystem as well as provided a platform for other team and product members to challenge and then debate on some of the fundamental assumptions of the product and its role in the targeted diaspora.
True to our belief that the impact sector is at the center of our work and mission, the sprint concluded with a day-long interaction with several NGOs working in the North East and it was both informative as well as reinforced some of our assumptions of the impact sector at large.
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” goes the saying and Team Tech4Dev seem to have taken this message to heart. Days started early with morning treks, basketball games and walks that not only enabled us to enjoy the local scenery, but also provided us with ample opportunities to connect to team members at a personal level in the midst of such a hectic work schedule. It also helped each and every one of us make the sprint to be a wholesome experience.
As I left back after the sprint, I was already looking forward to the next sprint and the opportunity to meet, ideate and celebrate being part of Tribe Tech4Dev.Title: My inaugural Tech4Dev sprint

==================================================

This blog is written by Nidhi Goyal, from
Tech4Dev
Of all the places I had imagined work would take me to, Dehradun was not one of them! But thanks to the terrific team at
Tech4Dev
I spent a couple of days last week soaking in the greenery in Dun while also being inspired by the group of founders, problem solvers, and technology enthusiasts
With the covid induced workstyles over the past 2 years, I had almost forgotten the power of a group of people coming together in person. But these couple of days in Dehradun last week, when I finally got a chance to meet the extended Tech4Dev team, were a helpful reminder.
I must admit that on video calls my interactions had been easy, yet I wasnt sure what it would be like to actually meet all of the extended team. The ease with which the introductions (and the jokes) flowed when we came together for our first cup of chai on 11
th
eve, set the tone for the next 2 days.
Introduction session
In so many ways the elements of culture that we spoke about the next day were all visible in the first meeting itself.
Transparency and openness are clearly the cornerstones for
Tech4Dev
. The collaboration among what would otherwise be considered competing entities was driven by their sincere commitment to the purpose above all else. Arjavs session on culture only helped us explicitly call out these elements (and a few more) that the team had already been living.
Arjav’s session on Culture
For me personally, it was an opportunity to learn more not just about
Glific
, WIT, Fractional CTO, and the Data platform but also about our collaborators from
Avni
,
Dhwani
,
Aam Digital
,
Hyperverge Academy
,
Colored Cow
, and
Dasra
.
While corporations around the world draw out multi-year digital transformation roadmaps and tech talent gets more expensive by the day, it was heartening to see this group of change agents working to make technology accessible for the social sector and providing them the means to be more impactful in their work. The fact that the NGO user base has been doubling year on year without any marketing investments is a testimony to the value our tech tools are able to add to their work. The team of course has taken note of additional feature requests and I am keen to see how the product evolves over the next few months.
Looking forward to our next sprint in Pondicherry where we expect to have better weather, even better food (for the body and the soul), and exceptionally good coffee!Title: My journey through building a Data Pipeline + Thoughts on Jaipur Sprint

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/my-journey-through-building-a-data-pipeline/
==================================================

NGOs in recent times and especially in a post-COVID context are collecting large amounts of data – operational and beneficiary related that could drive insights across their programs and internal organization. In the past few years, this data comes from multiple sources (Apps, Surveys, Messaging, IVRS). But, lack of technical personnel capacity, cost, and knowledge of modern data pipelining tools all combine to make this a difficult endeavor to make the jump from digital data collection to program and operational efficiencies and insights.
What is a Data Platform?
So at Tech4Dev, we are building a Sass product that can pull data from different sources, and easily perform transformations on it. So that pipeline can run every day at a given time without doing any manual work.
These are the different platforms we have chosen for our pilot program. Our goal is to build a full data pipeline using these tools to be able to visualize the data in an easy way.
1. Airbyte:- Airbyte is a data ingestion tool that pulls data from the source and pushes data to the destination. We do this by using the connectors and we can even make our custom connector which we will talk about.
2. Postgres:- Postgres will be our primary focus where we will push data from different sources from Airbyte.
3. dbt :- dbt will help you solve the use cases which you cant solve with SQL. You can perform analyses using tools available in open source Python ecosystem.
4. Superset:- After data goes through this pipeline we will have a merged dataset to visualize the use case.
So this is what we are trying to do for a few months and we have successfully built one solid pipeline for one of the NGOs
My first connector for Airbyte
So coming from a functional programming language(Elixir) I got an opportunity to work as a data engineer. Starting with learning python, understanding the whole pipeline, and how it works was a great learning for me. A few sleepless nights and late-night discussions with the Airbyte team helped me tremendously.
Our first source connector was built for Stir Education – SurveyCTO. This connector supports features like full refresh, incremental sync + dedup. We had to go through lots of challenges building this connector. We tackled one problem at a time and discussions with
Vinod
helped us solve the problems.
Finally, we submitted our first
PR
to the Airbyte team, and after successfully writing successful test cases and acceptance tests it was ready to be merged. This is one of the major contributions I have done to the Open Source community other than Glific.  Im really proud of what we have done as a Team to help NGOs to get a better understanding of their data. We will build a few more connectors as we move along with our data platform.
This is what our source looks like for SurveyCTO. For other users, we have added the docs for it so they can use it without any hassle.
Our discussions at Jaipur Sprint.
Meeting with the team in person is always a great fun and learning experience for me. Here are some highlights of what we are going to focus on for a few weeks now and some interesting thoughts.
1. We discussed building a strong support team to help NGOs as much as we can. We have also come up with a few solutions which you will see in action in a few days.
2. One of the major things we are going to do is move our docs from Slab to Docusaurus. Which supports search in the documentation. We will release this soon.
3. I had a lot of good conversations with
Lobo
and he answered a lot of questions which helped me clear my thoughts. Just wanted to appreciate his time.
4. Other than work we explored Jaipur with the team and we did a lot of fun activities with the team. What I enjoyed the most is the lunch discussions where everyone used to have one meal together.
So far we are doing lots of interesting work with NGOs and to improve our community we will keep having these sprints where other NGOs can come and share their thoughts.Title: My journey to the social sector

==================================================

My introduction to the tech world was at my school computer lab and through the Tandy RadioShack TRS-80 (or the trash 80 as us kids referred to it). We later got an Apple II Plus at home. Neither of these were cutting edge machines – they were both discontinued models by the time Id started using them. I can still remember the initial rush triggered by that green monochrome flicker on the screen when the machine booted up. All the amazing things we could do with a few lines of code. Ok, it was turtle Logo – but still so cool!
Decades passed and sadly so did the excitement. Technology has a strange way of progressing at a pace fast enough to make everything seem stationary for a while. After close to two decades around the startup and small business world, the thrill and satisfaction of building new products and companies was starting to get a little blunted as well.
A few months ago, someone was kind enough to share a post about Project Tech4Dev with me. Interesting. Before I knew it, I had read through half a dozen blog posts (you should too). Id looked up their open-source projects on GitHub, and finally arrived back on LinkedIn. Whaddya know – theyre hiring. I applied immediately, for a role that seemed quite similar to what Id been doing for the past couple of years, except in the social sector instead of small businesses/startups.
Lobo got back to me a few days later and we had a conversation late one evening soon after. After a brief round of introductions and a pleasant walk through my career so far, we got around to talking about my expectations. Lobo was refreshingly blunt about tempering my expectations on all aspects of the role and sector as a whole. It was a great introduction to a relatively new world for me.
Over the next few weeks, I had great conversations with Ashwin, Erica and Vinod. I later met the larger team in person in Bangalore before and during the
OASIS
Summit – a conference for open-source software in the social sector. My interactions with the team and with the larger ecosystem as a whole were completely different from what I expected. The energy and passion around me reminded me a lot of what I saw in the Silicon Valley when I was starting out my professional career.
By the next month, Id already decided to join Tech4Dev full-time, but I still had a couple of commitments to wind down. I did however attend the Kochi sprint with several amazing NGOs, involved in the Data Catalyst Program and the LLM Cohort. Met some of the most passionate, purpose-driven, humble and friendly people I have ever met. It was overwhelming at first, but I eventually got a feel for asking the right questions to get a big-picture idea of the impact they were trying to create and the challenges they faced in getting there. Still a total noob, but learning a lot with every conversation.
Ive officially started my role as a fractional CxO, spending my first full week getting introduced to the people and visions of a couple of wonderful organizations that Ill be working with for the next few months.
Im winding down my week tinkering with Airbyte (one of the open-source tools we leverage for our
Dalgo
platform). It loads up. And there it is – a familiar monochrome green flicker and a rush of excitement. What amazing things can we help make possible?Title: Navigating the Bangalore Sprint: Coffee, Collaboration, and Learning with Dalgo

==================================================

Leading up to the Bangalore sprint, before I even knew I would be visiting the city, I had an intense craving for filter coffee. Little did I know that the week ahead would be filled with plenty of it, both in and outside the office.
As someone new to the organization, I was a bit anxious about meeting everyone, but connecting with the team in person early on helped ease those nerves. One of the highlights was learning about Dalgo, the ETL platform I’d soon be working on.
The first day kicked off with introductions to Rohit, Ishan, Ashwini, Himanshu, Abhishek, and Siddhant at the stunning Omidyar office, with its beautiful views of the city and the clouds.
As the day unfolded, Siddhant introduced me to Dalgo and dbt (Data Build Tool), which is essential for data transformation within the platform. By the end of the day, I was building dbt SQL models. Whether it was due to my learning ability or Siddhant’s teaching skill is still up for debate. Also, it was pretty fun witnessing a very heated 30-minute discussion between Ishan and Rohit about where to get lunch from.
Day two had a rocky start when I underestimated Bangalore’s infamous traffic, arriving late to the all-hands Tech4Dev meeting. This led to me giving my introduction while catching my breath at the fire exit, which hopefully added some flair to my first impression. On the work front, Rohit walked me through mGramSeva, a platform that tracks water connections across towns and villages.
By day three, I was comfortable enough with the data to begin building SQL models for mGramSeva’s data transformations and analysis. Day four involved digging deeper into the complexities of the data, raising questions that only those involved in the data collection proces
s could answer—data, as insightful as it is, has its layers of intricacy.
The sprint wrapped up on day five, and though I was sad to see it end, the team successfully completed many of their goals that they had decided before the sprint. I left with a clear understanding of the organization, the people, and the work ahead. I felt fully equipped to contribute once I returned to working remotely.
Overall, I’m grateful for the chance to meet my teammates in person and excited to dive further into Project Tech4Dev and Dalgo with such a supportive, knowledgeable and very fun group.Title: New Dalgo Features for June
Author: Rohit
Date: June 2024
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/new-dalgo-features-for-june/
==================================================

Team Dalgo has been hard at work and have a cornucopia of features to release this month. In addition to this post we’re going to have a webinar on June 28th introducing all of them.
Data Statistics
Point it at a table in your warehouse and get column-level statistics:
Every row in the screenshot above corresponds to a column in the table “worldometer_data”. The column names are on the left i.e. “NewCases”, “Continent”, “NewDeaths” etc. Then we show the column’s data type followed by
Number of distinct values in that column
Number of records with a NULL value in that column
A value distribution of the top 5
And for numeric columns, the Minimum, Maximum, Mean, Median, and Mode
This is being made available within the
graphical workflow designer
for transformations. It is meant to give you a quick view into the
nature
of a table; either a table which you want to start working from or a table which you have created and which you would now like to check.
Data Quality Dashboards
We have integrated
Elementary
into our dbt pipelines. Elementary tracks your dbt tests and generates a beautiful report for you:
You can view tests by model:
And when tests fail, Elementary helps you find out what went wrong:
In this first release we’re providing only this reporting interface; the tests themselves still need to be
written in dbt
and checked into your GitHub repository.
Source Schema Change Detection and Handling
Suppose you have a data source which Dalgo syncs to your warehouse, and now suppose that source changes. Maybe a table was added, maybe a column was removed. Airbyte, which we run under the hood,
has a way
to detect this and let the user know. We are now exposing this feature of Airbyte to you through the Dalgo UI:
When you see this notification, you would either
accept these changes and thereby update your pipeline,
or realize that the changes were wrong and go fix the source.
Custom Tasks for dbt
Finally, we’ve added the ability to create “custom dbt tasks”. The dbt tasks like “run” and “test” which are available by default will run your entire workflow. But dbt lets you run
only one model
if you want to, or a particular set of models. We’ve made this functionality available by allowing you to define a
custom dbt task
:
You can then save these custom tasks and use them in your pipelines:
In Summary
We hope you find these new features useful, and as always we look forward to your feedback. Don’t miss Shamoon’s webinar on the 28th!

group of software partners attending the Meet deliberated on what went well in
Cohort 1 and what could be improved for Cohort 2. Participants recounted
experiences in Cohort 1 on
Both, software partners and NGO
     partners, understanding each other?s work better. The importance of face-to-face meetings early in the
     project was highlighted, as well as the need for the software partner to
     visit the NGO?s field site and not just their head office so as to better
     understand the on-ground work.
Clarifying roles and
     responsibilities at the start of each project to avoid confusion on
     commitments and obligations later. Several NGOs are at a scale and stage
     of growth that are similar to those of a small business. Software partners therefore needed to account for
     the fact that there may not be a dedicated IT team at the NGO which is why
     the software partner would need to invest time in understanding the NGO?s
     processes, helping with the articulation of requirements, and providing
     the technical know-how to deploy a solution.
Communication and responsiveness
     throughout the project. Since technology
     is likely to be an enabler for an NGO, and not the core reason for its
     existence, it is important to recognize that the leadership of the NGO may
     be grappling with multiple priorities. The software partners shared
     practices on how to manage communication with a client so as to keep a
     project on track.
Software
partners also discussed how their experiences, even outside the Tech4Dev grant,
could be leveraged to improve management processes in Cohort 2.
2. Looking ahead to Cohort 2
Along
with the software partners, we also finalised all that was necessary for a
smooth cohort 2 management experience. This includes:
A Standard
operating procedure articulating best practices for managing cohort 2
All legal
documentation including relevant LOUs, contracts, and agreements between all
partners within the Tech4Dev initiative
Discussion
on financials ? necessity of refining a template that details the financials
During a webinar with the new
NGO grantees, the NGOs were given a clear view of the timelines and milestones
and some of the questions on LOUs and data management were answered.
The purpose of the webinar was to emphasize on the fact that it is
as important for the NGOs to own the project as for the software partners and
that though there is no grant money flowing from the NGO to the software
partner, both partners should consider the relationship as a client-vendor
relationship.
These steps taken for formalizing these documents are designed to work on areas of improvement articulated during feedback conversations with all NGO and software partners for cohort 1 and also to include other best practices in software development. Legal documentation makes the project concrete with clear timelines, milestones, deliverables, and responsibilities of all partners. This is expected to lead to a smoother project management experience.
Technology Platforms
:
Tech4Dev?s
vision is creating a movement for open source technology solutions for the
social sector so that there is minimization of similar solutions being created
repeatedly by different NGOs so that less money is spent on reinventing the
wheel and the NGOs can economically access similar solutions for addressing
their own challenges. This can happen through open source platforms that can be
easily and quickly customised for a variety of applications and uses.
1.
Discussions on data collection and grant management platforms:
Market sizing and research crucial
     before investing in development
UI/UX and perceived quality cannot
     be less than other commercially available solutions and users do care
     about these
Developing these open source
     platform solutions and pushing for more adoption within the social sector
     would be a core Tech4Dev focus area
All of these are important from the point of view of driving
adoption amongst NGOs and also for encouraging technology providers and
software companies currently not with Tech4Dev to take up these platforms for
their social sector clients. Considering that most software companies are
for-profit, it is also necessary to have a solid business case for them to take
up the platforms being built at Tech4Dev and these would help build such a case.
2.
NGOs may need to do a lot more in terms of using easily available solutions and
off-the-shelf alternatives before they get into customised solutions built for
them. This may help NGOs get the maximum benefit from simple and economical
solutions without the need for a big upfront investment into building something
purely customised for their needs. This would also encourage them to be more
disciplined and extract more out of existing data as process optimisation and
understanding of data are necessary prerequisites to technology deployment. Raj
Gilda, from LAHI, spoke on this.
3. Product marketing based on the technology adoption lifecycle can
be one approach to make easily deployable products out of open source solutions
developed within Tech4Dev.
The discussion
highlighted how many of the existing Tech4Dev software partners have a
background in services and stepping into a product mindset may be a new foray
for many.Title: November 2019 Meeting Notes

==================================================

Our regular (twice-yearly) face-to-face meeting with all our
partners took place in Pune on Nov 10 -12. This was my first time attending
such a meeting and so I was looking forward to meeting all the partners and putting
a face to the names and voices I had heard on the calls. I was happy to have
made it ? it was thoroughly educational for me and went a long way in getting
to know the partners, the issues and the solutions we have been working on.
Technical Deep Dive
This was the first time we had a tech-day ? a deep dive
technical session scheduled for the entire day ? on the Sunday (Nov 10) before
the meeting began. All our partners were present from Sunday.  On Sunday, we were also joined by a couple of
people from Persistent Systems, our newest software partner.
The tech session had two parallel sessions; one doing a
deep-dive into Avni (nee OpenCHS) architecture and another doing a deep-dive
for a CRM solution. Both the sessions were attended by half the attendees and
had a great open discussion on architecture details and technologies. That day
was an engineer?s dream day ? sitting in a room all day spending time in the
weeds rather than nebulous details like deployments and legal matters.
Day 1
We started Day 1 with introductions. The Lumen folks (Rahul
and Arjav) had given us homework a few days before the meeting ? we were to
introduce ourselves with a limerick. Everyone did an amazing job of
introductions and that broke the ice to start off the proceedings.
We started with a look back: we talked about learnings from
Cohort 1 and how we could do better for cohort 2 in terms of managing the
projects and improving engagement from NGOs.
After the learnings and looking back, we started in earnest with presentations from the software partners about projects. Anurag from Think201 talked about their experience working with Indus Action project; Swapnil from Dhwani presented the mForm Funder Management Platform and Sunil from WebAccess presented the Toybank project.
Our keynote speaker for the day was Raj Gilda who talked
about his journey starting and running Lend-A-Hand India over the past 16
years. Lend-A-Hand India has been doing amazing work teaching vocational skills
in public schools to 9
th
to 12
th
grade students in over
20 states. He had some insightful (and sobering) things to say about working
with government and how underappreciated bureaucrats are. Raj has
single-handedly grown his organization from one school in Maharashtra to over
23 states in the last 16 years.
We ended afternoon session with a discussion of legal
documents we need from software partners and NGOs and general procedures for
Cohort 2. We had great suggestions and action items from the partners who have
more experience dealing with NGOs than Tech4Dev does.
A team dinner followed the first day sessions; it was a
great opportunity to meet and talk to everyone in a more relaxed setting over
food and drink. Everyone had a great time. When I left the dinner venue, a
bunch of folks were going for an after dessert walk.
Day 2
Day 2 started with a talk by Anuja Apte, a marketing
consultant. She talked about product marketing and what it takes to change a
company?s DNA from selling services (projects) 
to marketing and selling products. For many of those present, it was a
great introduction to marketing, market sizing etc.
Anuja?s talk was followed by a second session on legal
documents and clarification of why we need Letters of Understanding from
software partners and from NGOs and what agreements should be signed when.
Then we started the second day?s project presentations by
the software partners. At this time. Some Tech4Dev and Lumen folks adjourned to
another venue where the kickoff webinar for Cohort 2. The webinar was a great
success, attended by all the Cohort 2 NGOs.
The keynote speaker for day 2 was Pradnya Godbole, CEO of
DeAsra Foundation. She talked about her personal journey to running the
foundation as well as the foundation?s approach to giving.
Keynote was followed by more technical presetations on Avni
and by Civic Data folks on open justice projects.
Takeaways
All three days gave us a lot of things to think about and to
work towards cohort 2 projects and beyond. The biggest takeaways for me were
seeing how open and candid everyone was with each other. Everyone was genuinely
interesting in learning and sharing; no one came with any other agenda than to
tell us what they were doing and learning from others. 



Finally, all the arrangements from meeting space
to catering, to webinar space for our kickoff webinar and the team dinner were
impeccably made by Arun. Arjav and Rahul from Lumen drove the agenda and the
content for most of the non-technical sessions.  And, of course, all attendees came prepared to
share and learn. Thanks.Title: OASIS week

==================================================

Last week was fun – a lot of people were in town! It started Tuesday afternoon with my meeting Vinod on 100 ft Road in Indiranagar for a very-early-in-the-day beer next to his hotel while we waited for Erica and Lobo to get in from Delhi. Eventually we figured out that they were booked at a different hotel, so I headed home but rejoined them at 6pm at Concu. (More precisely, we met at Third Wave but it was way too loud so we walked down the street)… by this time there were seven of us but Concu had plenty of space.
We had initially booked a table for dinner at Podi and Spice, but after some cross-communication we cancelled that reservation and walked over to Burma Burma… where we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. Nobody wanted to walk back to BIC so we crossed the street and got a table for 10 at the Pizza Bakery. It was our first time meeting our newest colleague Sangeeta in person, and my first time meeting Tejas since he started at T4D.
After dinner everyone went home or back to their hotels. and Nair discovered that 100 ft Rd in Koramangala isn’t 100 ft Rd in Indiranagar.
The next morning Nair and I met at Paper and Pie to hammer out some items from our current sprint, and were joined soon after by Erica, Lobo, Rajeev, and Vinod. Vinod was headed back to Chennai that evening so when he left we said goodbye, but everyone else was staying for the OASIS conference on Thursday.
Thursday we started early! Nair messaged me saying that setup started at 8, but I needed to eat first so I didn’t get to BIC until 8:45. Arvind had gotten back into town the night before, and after the three of us connected our laptops to the television screens and set our videos on repeat, we headed out to Lavonne for coffee.
By the time we got back people had started showing up… the Tech4Dev team as well as other people we knew. Lots of catching-up was happening and the mood was upbeat! Then we all filtered into the auditorium for the first two blocks – a keynote followed by a panel discussion. After that I was part of a session in one of the smaller meeting rooms where I was very pleased to see two former coworkers in the audience. The discussion went well and each panelist had questions from audience members afterwards, until the organisers gently shooed us out to make room for the next talk.
I spent the rest of the day hanging around our booth, talking to whoever came by, telling them about Dalgo and whether or not it was appropriate for them. I finally got to hand out the business cards which were printed for me back in … April? May? I had brought an entire box and just left a stack on our table for people to pick up.
By 4:30pm my throat was tired from all the talking, so I packed up and headed home. It was a great week and I’m looking forward to the next big team gathering in Cochin next month, where Vikram has promised us a gym AND a swimming pool.

==================================================

Keeping up with tradition (and its getting harder to do so, since seems like everyone else is beating me to it these days), another trip report, some thoughts and reflections and a look back at my evolution (and growth, I think) in the sector.
As always, I’m both exhausted (yes, I say this every time, but believe me, this trip really was the most exhausting in a good way) and super energized. It’s great to see so many folks in the Tech4Dev Ecosystem and also the broader NGO ecosystem that I’m so ingrained with. Lots of high highs, and a few lows but overall the Tech4Dev team is excited at what we are doing and where we are headed.
I’ll retreat to one of my really old tricks, and list a few of the highs and lows on this trip and include the past few weeks
I feel so fortunate that we have Erica Arya leading Tech4Dev, and Vinod Rajasekaran rounding up our management team. It’s really nice to have people you sync with so nicely across multiple levels and being able to be honest and upfront with them. Thankful, that they put up with me 🙂
Our ecosystem work and collaboration was in full display at the Data Catalyst program in Kochi, with 4 different orgs with very different skillsets and vision coming together (Dasra, GoalKeep, Agency Fund and Tech4Dev). All of us made compromises, but seeing things come together was so beautiful. It was a good start, we can and will improve, but seeing the collaboration come together was very gratifying.
We’ve hired a few new senior FCxO’s to the team (Ashwini L, Thomas M, Radhika B). The one thing that I’m struck with is how much trust and faith they put in us, how much they are willing to believe in us. I hope we live up to their expectations and faith
Over the past few weeks, I’ve had long conversations with a few of my ‘heroines / heroes’ in the sector. Sucheta B , Vishal T, Anshu G, Sunanda M, Sapna K, Srikanth. I’ve gotten to know many of these orgs a bit more with some of the work we’ve done with T4D. From the Chintu Gudiya Foundation perspective, I’m beginning to appreciate and understand why we need to support ‘larger’ orgs with unrestricted funding also. Over time, I’ve realized that we are in the business of supporting people and their passion, and it’s ok for us not to understand completely what they are doing and/or their impact. I trust that Sucheta, Anshu, Sapna and others are more deeply connected and concerned with that, than what I’ll ever understand. Totally fine with this.
We had our advisory committee meetings (Sanjeev, arun, Kurund and Nidhi) and got good feedback and mostly positive reinforcement.. We followed that up with an executive committee meeting (which became a 1-on-1 due to various scheduling and sickness issues). We’ve improved our processes, financial reporting, mid term thinking thanks to the feedback we’ve recd from these groups
It’s great to see the blog posts flow out from each sprint without me having to nudge, cajole and please. If you’ve not done so, check out the
Tech4Dev Blogs
and
Glific Blogs
to read the latest reports. This is such a great lead generator for us and serves as an excellent report for funders.
In my last two trips I’ve managed to spend close to a week with the young developers on the team (Akhilesh, Siddanth, Shamoon and Amisha). Its always such a joy to spend time with them. I still think of myself as a developer, love to code and solve problems (they might disagree). I also see a younger version of myself in them, and hope they listen to a few things I say and avoid some of my mistakes. Love the passion of Akki, the calmness of Siddanth, the strength of Amisha. Here’s a photo, they selected to display here: (we missed u Shamoon)
In the things we can do better
We can and will improve on managing people better. We need to set expectations better, give people the strength to speak up and say their views, listen closely to their feedback and figure out how we can help them in their career trajectory, Our team meeting and pulse check within the group highlighted some areas that we can improve.
Sometimes it feels like we are trying to do too many things at the same time. Are we pushing people too much? and/or setting our expectations a bit too high?
We try and be as transparent with our work and approach with our partner NGOs. Our goal is to improve the ecosystem around us and help uplift the sector. At times, it seems we need to convince our NGO partners of this. We need to understand and realize we are all in this together.
We wrapped up our relationship with a close partner since we were on two different trajectories. Its a bit sad for me personally, since we are still trying to get the collaborative open-source-product-building model to work nicely with software partners, and this partnership seemed to be on the right track. Back to the drawing board on this to see what we could have done better
We always tell people to not spend more than 60-90 minutes on a blog post. I’m coming close to the limit, this post is getting a bit too long, so will save the rest for another dayTitle: One month with Glific

==================================================

Hi
, I am Kumudini from Maverick Labs, Pune. I am about to complete my one year as a software development Engineer with a bunch of experience on few projects. The journey from an intern to an employee, from started knowing about the frameworks to work on real projects was fantastic. And I am glad that one of the good experiences is with Glific. Here I am to share my one-month experience of joining the Glific team as a new frontend developer.
I recently finished working on a project and one day Madhuri(Co-founder of Maverick Labs, Pune) came to me saying you have got one new opportunity to work with the team called Glific . You will be joining them with one of your colleagues. I was asked to attend the webinar before we actually talk about the Glific and to get the idea of the same. I was excited and nervous at the same time since the team I would be working with was new for me. The tech stack was different than I used to work on before. And the day came when we all were going to talk about it in a standup meeting call. We introduced ourselves there, had some introductory talks on the project. I was a little bit worried that how can I cope up with this new and comparatively big team I have ever worked with. But the standup meetings were really helpful to get to know the team better. I would like to thank especially Lobo who was always cheerful. One of my seniors in the team helped us to walk through the work already done on Glific. I was amazed to know about such great work by the team. And I am now glad to be a part of this team.
I and Shreesh (my colleague) got one week to get onboarded with the Glific team and learn about the technologies that were being used. Besides that, we learned more about the process of working, most importantly the purpose behind this project, which helped us to go along the flow. I had not worked with Typescript, Apollo GraphQl frameworks before, but google and youtube are always there to help you self studying. We spent few days learning the new tech stack and the flow. Luckily we have Dignesh to help us when needed. Along with that, I started fixing small bugs and that helped me more to get into the project.
After a week we brace ourselves to do new tasks. We got our first issue. Initially, it took time to find the fixes and to get along with the functionalities. It took a little bit more time than usual to accomplish the task. Initially, it took most of the day to dig into the code and try to come up with at least a plan of action to discuss with the team. It was frustrating to keep trying on the same issue but failed to give the final correct solution. But once I started talking to the team about my difficulties I was able to complete my task. With the help of seniors and self-study, I was able to do it.
And yay I committed my first task within an assigned day.
It was such a relief. I got the pinch of confidence and was ready to work on another issue. But then I got to know that I am still not done with the given task. There is a procedure for submitting any feature. And testing is an important part of that. I need to do react and cypress testing for the same. In the next week, I felt like I am again back on step one. But this time, I was not so nervous. I started learning about the testing. With the help of youtube tutorials and my senior Dignesh, I was able to do that as well. This is how I got the first fully completed task with the green tick mark on it.
Now the tasks became more interesting to me rather than scary. And beyond this, working on such an open-source project and witnessing the hard work done by the team to make it more user-friendly is a great experience. It allowed me to explore. Stretching myself beyond my comfort zone helped me to grow with new learnings. Now its been a month with this team and I have started enjoying the process of exploring and learning. I am very much thankful to my seniors for helping whenever needed and being supportive. I am happy and proud to be working with such a cheerful team and looking forward to coming up with the new skills to flaunt 😛Title: One year and beyond: Looking back and forward

Another India trip, another long airplane flight(s), another blog post. You probably got the pattern by now 🙂 The nice part of the trip(s) back and forth is I transit thru Japan (and sneak into Tokyo for a meal) which is becoming one of my favorite countries.
Weve got the
publish our thoughts culture
fine tuned at tech4dev. Im both happy and sad to see that I’m one of the last folks to post my blog about the team meet. Weve had some amazing posts from
Ishaan
,
Akhilesh
,
Robert
,
Piyali
,
Ankit
and
Sneha
(who provides a good overview and summary of the sprint). Please do go read them, a lot more entertaining than what follows.
Our team meet was happening fairly close to the larger annual retreat of Dasra. We realized that this is a great opportunity to piggy back on thier shoulders and avoid dealing with the logistical issues. And once again, Dasra rescued us, and in the process also raised our bar of team retreat locations and organization. Karjat was insanely hot during the day, but really nice in the mornings, and I managed to get a couple of long walks in with Deval and Robert. The biggest reason we wanted to do this with Dasra, was to give everyone the experience and feeling of being part of something bigger than us, being part of a larger entity that we can work with, learn from and collaborate with. Every time I meet and spend time with Deval and Neera, Im truly humbled and walk away with an immense sense of pride, for what they have achieved, and gratitude for being a part of the Dasra ecosystem.
The power of in-person gatherings for a remote team like Tech4Dev is immense. We get to know each other in a deeper and more meaningful way, talk about issues and concerns, and make an attempt to build a strong vibrant culture within the team. I started the trip by hosting the Glific developers (much to the dismay of the rest of the team) in Mumbai and showed them a few of my favorite eating places. I also ended the trip by hanging out with Siddanth and Abhishek and managed to drag Siddanth to my multiple meetings with family and the sharanam girls & young woman.
We also extended the concept of the tech4dev team, by inviting a couple of our board members (Arun and Kurund), our partners (Ishaan @ Think 201 and Swapneel @ Goalkeep), our partner/funder (Robert @ Agency Fund) and
Rajeev Mohan
, a potential future Fractional CxO for us. We also seem to be settling into the pattern of alternating smaller work gatherings, with larger sprints with multiple NGOs. At a meeting like this one, we got to spend a lot of time on who we are as a team and our focus, do a lot of product planning, and also a fair bit of development and coding.
Pre-sprint, we decided to split into 4 groups (Data Platform, Glific Development, Glific BizDev and Fractional CxO). Each group planned their own agenda for the 4+ days we were there, but we did have a couple of all-group talks and discussions to get everyone to see the bigger picture and what we want to accomplish as an organization. We are doing quite a few things right, but I also think we need (and will seek) external help in building the culture of the team along with helping us with people management. Erica and I have learned that we need to make things a lot more explicit, let people know of our expectations, and ensure that they know that they have the power and responsibility of deciding the vision of their respective program areas. Quite excited to see how things play out over the next few months, and see people thrive and prosper.
I ended my India trip with a visit to Pune, to meet Raj, Ravi, Vinita, and Akash @
Lend a Hand India (LAHI)
. Weve been working with LAHI for the past couple of months now in a tech advisory role and wanted to deepen our relationship. While typing out my notes earlier today, I realized that LAHI is the first NGO to use all of T4Ds core services. They use both Glific and Avni (and also helped fund the Avni+Glific integration), Im acting as their Fractional CxO, and weve started the discussion with onboarding them onto the Data Platform.
We discussed this during the sprint, and the meeting with LAHI kinda crystallized this for me. For some of our platforms (specifically Avni and Glific), we are at a stage where we are meeting the needs of most NGOs. For us to take these platforms to the next level, we need to innovate. For this to happen, we need to understand the program needs of a few NGOs a lot better and to a large extent be part of their team. We are headed down that road with NGOs like LAHI and
TAP
(The Apprentice Project), and I suspect this will steer us in new directions that will help us serve the ecosystem better.
Lots and lots more thoughts, but I should save them for future posts and let them settle down a wee bit so we get more clarity. The one hurdle that we really need some help (and maybe different thinking on) is how to build more tech muscle and capacity both for our software and data partners and our NGOs. For us to succeed, we need to make a dent in this problem, and for that we need your help. If you have any crazy ideas, random thoughts or magic solutions, let us know. We are all ears!Title: Open City: Asking the right questions

==================================================

As part of the Tech4Dev cohort, in March 2020, we kickstarted the re-design of Open City, a city level data repository hosted and developed by
Oorvani Foundation
and
Data Meet.
The purpose of the redesign was to make the platform more accessible and user friendly.
It was exciting to start this because it let us experiment and explore more of CKAN, which is an open-source open data portal for the storage and distribution of
open data
as it forms the core of most of the platforms
CivicDataLab
has been building, be it Open Budgets India or the Justice Hub.
On doing some initial digging, we found that Open City gets close to 60k new users/month!
Check Aruns blog When Cookies Tell Stories
. It houses close to 534 Datasets and 1323 Documents and is continuously growing to cover more information and data from cities like Bengaluru, Chennai etc.  As designers, we were curious to study how data is being collected and more importantly,
consumed
at a city level. Towards exploring this we asked the following questions –
Who is seeing this data?
How is it useful to them?
These two primary questions, we realised, if researched well could not only benefit the redesign but also future engagements and expansion of Open City itself.
Our initial Waterfall Method approach to project management
The design research initially involved interviewing key stakeholders and as many Open City users as possible and was to be followed up by design implications report that would then feed the wireframing and development stages.
And then there was the pandemic.
Interviewing in the age of the pandemic:
Initially we thought it would be a breeze to line up interviews, everyone is at home, time slots shouldnt be too difficult to arrange. Well, how wrong we were! We made the classic mistake of being overly optimistic!
People and businesses were readjusting to the sudden disruption and though everyone was glad to talk to us,  mutually convenient slots were hard to come by, many subtle things were shifting we realised.
For example:
Boundaries of work and home were blurring, it was difficult and unrealistic to expect to not be interrupted while conducting an interview
and
Doing interviews through a screen, sometimes became a challenge when we had to switch off screen to save bandwidth or wait for the plane to pass or ask people to kindly repeat because of a fruit vendor out voiced the interviewee or of dropped signal and hoping their patience didnt!
This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because we also got invited into peoples personal spaces. We caught  glimpses of their private selves, on the walls which had their artwork or books stacked up to the ceilings, fascinating knick knacks neatly arranged on their works spaces, all very telling of the people we interviewed.
We heard pets, children, partners and their music(best part) which I dont think we would have known about in a typical design research exercise, conducted in an office or a clinically set up workshop. We truly learnt more about our interviewees, which helped us get a truer and a more holistic empathy map of our stakeholders.
We managed to interview key stakeholders who were extensive users of Open City
Civil Society Organisations
Journalist
Resident Welfare Associations
Student
Technologist
Researcher
We primarily wanted to understand
Why did they use Open City?
To uncover the motivation and entry points
How did they generally use Open City? This would uncover user behaviours and patterns
What were the challenges they faced?
This would help understand usability issues and bugs that may have been overlooked
Post the interviews
we took a pause and pivoted!
We restructured our Design Research approach. We realised that the user research needed to be more extensive but keeping within our project timelines and being mindful of the limitations that the pandemic brought, so we split our research up into two parts.
Shorter User Research
to design UI/UX
Longer Design Research
to suggest changes on sustainability and explore probable partnership models for Open City
Our new Staggered Method approach to project management
User Research to Design UI/UX
The user research to develop a platform involved:
Reading case studies on other such attempts across the globe
Studying the Google Analytics data of the platform
Conducting in-depth qualitative interviews with key stakeholders
Conducting quantitative research of close to 130+ urban dwellers to understand the most pressing issues they face, to structure the information hierarchy on the platform
Evaluating the usability of OpenCity platform and a review of other city-level data platforms
Synthesizing and analysing the above to provide a coherent understanding of the research
Mapping our Users
Empathy Maps
An empathy map is a collaborative visualization tool used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It externalizes knowledge about users in order to
Create a shared understanding of user needs, and
Aid in decision making.
We created empathy maps to understand the motivation, fears, needs and user behaviour, traits and characteristics that would help us design the user flows.
Affinity Maps
Affinity diagramming has long been used in business to organize large sets of ideas into clusters. In UX, the method is used to organize research findings or to sort design ideas in ideation workshops
2
We used it primarily for quickly organizing:
Observations or ideas from our interviews
Ideas that surface in design-critique of Open City
Ideas about UX strategy and vision
Affinity Maps collating the Key challenges & Aspirations of interviewees
and condensing them to Insights
Open City�s User Persona
After analysing the Affinity maps and Empathy maps we conceptualised 4 primary User personas for Open City
Data Browser
Data Sharer
Data Deep Diver

Open City User Personas
We also conducted a co-ideation session, to come up with more ideas from a technology, design and community perspective, with Oorvani Foundation and Citizen Matters team and the bigger team at CivicDataLab. Which saw a good and enthusiastic turn out from both sides, more about it in the next blog.
The ideas collated from the affinity mapping and ideation workshop are being sieved, sorted and analysed, from a design, tech and community lens. An exhaustive feature list has been generated and is currently being wireframed (design perspective) and developed (technology perspective) simultaneously.
In the last two months we found answers to a lot of problems, we are still figuring a few out and were sure well uncover more as we go ahead. But thats the beauty of Design Research as they say
Knowledge is having the right answer, Intelligence is asking the right questions.
We are excited to see how this would piece together to develop a visually good looking, functionally user friendly, technically less buggy and community driven platform in the next few months!

==================================================

Quick summary
Last week
Samanvay
and
Soft Corner
together kickstarted the work on OpenCHS UI designer. Together the teams plan to finish the work in next couple of months.
About OpenCHS
OpenCHS is an open-source platform that supports field workers, when they provide services to their clients in a field or when they do data collection. OpenCHS provides an android application that can be used in the field without Internet connectivity and a web browser based application for program coordinators/managers who provide supportive supervision to the field workers. OpenCHS has been implemented the most in public health but it is also getting implemented for other sectors. More details about OpenCHS can be found on its
website
.
Need for UI Designer
Today doing an OpenCHS implementation is not very intuitive to anyone outside of the product team. The metadata creation is tech heavy. It requires quite a bit of training on how an implementation is to be done and knowledge of json, sql and linux. This limits the software partners part of the tech4dev eco-system from doing OpenCHS implementations by themselves for the projects they are responsible for.
To fix the metadata problem, OpenCHS already has an admin UI. Most of the metadata creation (users, locations, catchments) is available there, the only last thing being the ability to design programs, forms and the custom logic required for skip logic, calculated fields, visit scheduling.
A joint effort by Samanvay and Soft corner with support from tech4dev
Soft corner came forward with an interest to contribute this feature to OpenCHS. And thus a joint effort by Samanvay and Soft corner started on this with support from tech4dev. Last week a couple of developers (Amar and Swapnil) travelled to Samanvay office in Bangalore to interact with the product team, understand OpenCHS in more depth and kicstart this project.
In last two weeks the two teams have brainstormed over problem statement, solutions, tech approaches. The two week inception concludes today with Amar and Swapnil travelling back to Pune 🙁
The team has come up with the following plan.
Scope
A UI from which the following can be designed
Programs
Forms with rules
Checklists
Out of scope
Self service UI for tech organisations to host on existing hosted solutions
This will require features like Database and reports access for partners, Log access for implementers, Server status available publicly, Ability to export and import data from an organisation, Migration of all existing rules to the new format
Self service UI for end users
Self service UI. The current purpose is not to have any organisation coming in and designing things for themselves. This is a good to have, but means that we need to integrate invoicing, emails, build a different kind of authentication, a lot more automation etc. The current objective is to be able to open up implementations to partners only. Opening it up to the general public will depend on how this goes. Partners will be empowered to handle data for their own organisations.
Translations from UI [Being done part of a separate epic]
User flow and Tech design choices – Key elements
Implementation with testing
Once an organisation is created in OpenCHS, an organisation administrator then proceeds to create all the necessary metadata. This includes users, locations, visit types, forms etc.
Testing will be performed using the OpenCHS webapp, or the Android app from PlayStore to ensure the implementation is as per an organisation’s liking.
A lot of test data gets created during this process. When the organisation is ready to go live with the implementation, the organisation administrator then exports all metadata to a zip file. Then she/he imports them into a new clean organisation. The old organisation can be used later for testing, etc.
Until now, we were working through different physical deployments of OpenCHS to move an organisation’s implementation through test and going live. The fundamental change here is to move to a more SaaS model, where there is just one physical deployment of OpenCHS. Test and implementation organisations live side-by-side.
Having the ability to deploy multiple instances of the same implementation requires some relaxing of the uniqueness rules in the database. This is one of the big shifts in the way data will be stored in OpenCHS going forward.
Rules
Being able to write complex rules brings the richness to OpenCHS. This would be very difficult for a non-tech person at an organisation to do it by themselves. So for now the intended writers of the rules would be a tech person. Even converting all types of logic into declarative form would be very difficult to implement. Considering these points, at the moment we decided to continue to support writing rules through javascript only.
However until now, custom rules were being served through a single javascript file for an implementation. This does not gel well with a form designer, so we have to now break it down into multiple smaller pieces. A code editor will be provided in the UI designer to write rules. Every rule will reside with the associated entity like program, form or form element.
Hierarchical Organisations
We found that managing hierarchical organisations is both difficult to maintain from both product and customisation standpoints, the feature is being deprecated. So UI designer won’t support this. Rather reference implementations would be there from where stuff can be copied over.
Project Plan
A single virtual team is formed with members from Samanvay and Soft corner. The team has already identified user stories and will be delivering the software with Agile software development methodology (read : User stories, daily standups, regular showcases, smaller releases and continuous delivery). The team plans to finish this work by end of September. We will have a couple of showcases done to the tech4dev community within this timeframe.

==================================================

Written by: Himanshu Singh, Dost Education
Data is often referred to as the new oxygen, and in today’s business landscape, leveraging data has become crucial for success. Business corporations across various sectors have been harnessing the power of relevant, reliable, and consistent data to drive their decisions. It’s high time that the social sector and development industries seize this opportunity to make their decisions more prompt and result-oriented, efficiently reaching their goals.
In the beautiful city of Kochi, Dost had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Data Catalyst Program 2023. This special event, organized by Tech4DEV, Dasra, Goalkeep, and The Agency Fund, was more than just a gathering; it was a significant step towards using data to positively impact people’s lives.
The program commenced with different organizations sharing their experiences with data. It felt like a puzzle where everyone held a unique piece, and had awareness about the importance of data. Some organizations showcased their robust data infrastructure, while others were still in the process of setting up their data systems. However, a common thread in all conversations was that most organizations are still grappling with fully utilizing their data.
The organizing team there helped in imagining that there are many ways to use data to make the world a better place. We learned that using data isn’t just about numbers. It became evident that, in the realm of data, we aren’t just dealing with statistics; we are shaping narratives, influencing positive change, and crafting a better world.
Dasra talked about how Data can help us in becoming good leadersnegotiating, being flexible, and thinking ahead.One of the best parts was when Dasra reminded us that learning and upskilling should happen regularly at all levels, including managerial and leadership positions. They emphasize on continuous learning ,and to keep adapting and learning as the world changes.
Goalkeep guided us on how to turn data into actionable insights. They stressed the importance of clear goals and using data effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes..
The Agency Fund provided valuable guidance on making decisions using data while reminding us that technology should always align with our values. They emphasized that, despite the use of advanced technology, it’s the human touch that makes a difference.
Tech4Dev underscored that while data utilization is vital, managing data is equally important. Data can be sensitive and includes personal details, making it crucial to protect and secure it. Hence, having a data governance policy is essential to safeguard our use of data
A big round of applause to Tech4DEV, Dasra, Goalkeep, and The Agency Fund who organized this event and who helped us understand some nuances of data. It is an excellent initiative toward enabling the social sector to leverage data for the benefit of society at large. It’s a big leap forward in how we use data to help peoplea call to action to apply what we’ve learned to make the world a better place.Title: Our Journey of Remoulding Data Collection – From Paper to KoboToolbox to Avni

==================================================

Smita Kale, Monitoring and Evaluation Manager at Shelter Associates, shares about their journey of moving from Paper-based data collection to digital systems, first using KoboToolbox and then to Avni.
Lokmanya nagar slum
Shelter Associates (SA)
, a Civil Society Organization founded in 1993, comprising architects, GIS experts, social workers, community workers and volunteers have carried extensive work in areas of cost-effective housing, basic infrastructural facilities, health, hygiene and sanitation while inspiring behavioural change in the slum dwellers. We work towards empowering communities living in informal settlements to pursue their right to dignity and sustainable life.
In this article, we talk about our approach of moving from Paper-based field data collection to KoboToolbox, and then finally to Avni. We share some lessons learnt and explain the advantages we see of an offline-based Android app for form data capture.
Data-Driven Approach
One of the organisations core competencies lies in its data-driven approach. We follow a rigorous process of collecting data through surveys and mapping efforts. The slum data collected by the team is spatially organised using GIS software and presented as an overlay on Google Earth remote sensing imagery. The collated data is used for inclusive urban planning and implementing affordable housing and sanitation schemes across the slums in Maharashtra. You can see live dashboards on our website. Our data-driven approach using technology to plan citywide strategies for social housing has impacted the Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) policy of GOI.
SA Slum data dashboard on our website
In 2013 we undertook a landmark project One Home One Toilet to deliver household toilets on a cost-sharing basis. The data-driven initiative follows a community-centric and an inclusive approach wherein it works closely with the municipal corporations right from validating data to toilet delivery. As of September 2020, SA has surveyed around 2,93,000 households for successful implementation of OHOT. It has impacted over 3,70,000 people directly & indirectly with a home toilet.
From Paper-based system to a digital system using KoboToolbox
In the early years of implementing various schemes, be it affordable housing or delivery of sanitation, data was collected through pen-paper surveys. Over the years we have shifted to other, more technological driven means of data collection. In 2016,
we shifted our collection system to the Android-based open-source platform of KoBoToolbox.
Kobo is one of the most popular data collection tools in the development sector. It provides an offline mobile app for data collection, a web app for designing forms and an option to extract collected data for further analysis.
Moving to Kobo certainly was a good step forward but we soon started facing limitations with it.
Limitations with KoboToolbox
1. Lack of ability to view and update records from the mobile app
KoboCollect does not support offline editing of records once submitted. It requires internet and is too complex as described in this
link
. Lack of any alternative for modifications forced us to survey the households repeatedly where data needed to be updated. With the increasing scale of interventions in different slums across cities, this was not a viable solution for long.
2. Form-based data model as against Case-based
If we have to submit 50 responses for a slum, same slum name is to be entered 50 times. This slows down the work. Moreover, there was no way to validate to ensure the name entered is correct. Ideally, we would want a way to be able to pick from an available list or a dropdown. There are
workarounds but no native case management support in KoboToolbox.
3. Redployment required to change form design
We could not add a question to the existing form and if we do, we
have to redeploy it and redeployment means losing existing data.
From KoboToolbox to Avni
While exploring solutions for these problems we came across the
Avni
application in a workshop organised by
Tech4Dev platform
in Pune. This open-source platform, with a rich data modelling approach, an offline app for data recording, web app for admin & form designing and different options to extract data, promised to solve the problems we were facing.
Initially, we started with the city of Kolhapur as a pilot. We first migrated our data from Kobo to Avni which turned out to be simple. Kobo provides a way to export data in excel and Avni provides a way to upload/import using CSV files. After importing the existing data, we soon initiated the data collection using Avni. To carry out the modifications accurately we trained our surveyors to use the application, fill in different types of forms and update any filled in data as per the required changes. The users found it easy and the pilot worked out really well. Thus we decided to adopt Avni for all our work and started using it for the Pune region as well.
SA Surveyors using Avni for data collection
Benefits of moving to Avni from Kobo Collect
Below are the key differences and benefits we are noticing of using Avni over Kobo. We are listing these down for the benefit of those considering both these options for fieldwork.
1. Ability to design a custom app using locations, subject, programs and forms from Avni data model
The most important difference between the two softwares is that Avni provided us with the ability to create app as per our data model and data collection process. We created our location hierarchy of City, Ward and Slums using locations; households are created as subjects and separate forms for different vertical services like property tax, solid waste management, metered water connection, etc.
SA data model in Avni
This provided us with 2 benefits
a. Avoid repetitive data collection
We register the household once and whenever a new service is provided, we record a new form by choosing an already registered household. This was not possible in Kobo and saves time and is very convenient to get real-time data.
b. Well modelled and segregated data enabling easy access to a subset of the entire data of a particular house
In the near future, household-level data collected can be shared and accessed with various departments of the Municipal Corporation to ensure work is carried out effectively. Data for sanitation, property tax, solid waste management, metered water connection, etc. once shared to the Municipal Corporation can be accessed for service delivery. For example, once a particular service like a metered water connection is provided to a household, the filled-in data can be retrieved and updated from a shared water connection to a metered water connection. As we collect and share data on different sectors, we can disintegrate it as per requirement and send it across various departments of the Municipal Corporation to link and use the collected data simultaneously. Once services are delivered the household data will be updated by our surveyors or the Municipal Corporation (if shared/access provided) and used further for monitoring tax collection, solid waste management, etc.
2. Ability to search, view and update records anytime in the mobile app
As described earlier, in Kobo Collect once the data is submitted it is not possible to view and edit them. In Avni, the records always stay in the device even after submitting to the server. They can be modified and synchronized again with the server. This is really helpful in the field!
SA Avni app screenshots
3. Ability to control access of data to surveyors based on their work areas
Another useful feature is the assignment of the catchment. The administrator can give access or remove access of any particular catchment to any surveyor. This has enabled us to maintain the privacy of the information as well.
4. Hassle free modification of forms
Avni supported easy modification of app design including forms without having to redeploy or losing data.
This customized, editable solution for data collection has made our work effective and greatly reduced the efforts to maintain updated household-level data.Title: Our stay and learnings at Samanvay

==================================================

OpenCHS is an open source and a comprehensive field worker system with built-in case management. It has a rule designer which gives configurable forms, decision support systems and visit-scheduling facility. It is a very powerful tool that can be used across domains. We got associated with it through a conference organized by Tech4Dev.
To take it to the next level, we found that the form designer was a crucial functionality which can be made much simpler than the current way of defining it. To speed up the course of development, Arjun planned for a collaborative face-to-face process and decided to have us visit Bangalore at their office for two weeks. The week starting July 22nd was the most suited for us to visit the Samanvay office.
Hiren, Amar, Swapnil and Arjun.
Photo taken by – Vinod 🙂
During the first couple of days, we did a deep dive into the rule functionality, which is a major part of the form designer. Since rules are a strong functionality in OpenCHS, we spent two days discussing its integration using the form designer. We tried out small spikes of executing the rules. For designing the UI, we made an effort with a couple of open source tools and finally chose one and start designing the UI. However, Vinay and Arjun suggested to sketch the UI with pen and paper instead of going for the exact look and feel as it would take ages to get to it.
On the third day, Hiren gave us an overview of the existing WebApp that has some functionality over the form builder part. We installed it to have some hands-on experience. Hiren and I did some sketching of the UI design
On the fourth and the fifth day, Swapnil started exploring ReactJS and began working on one of the stories. I teamed up with Hiren for adding stories and the estimation. For this, we used the ZenHub application where we created Epic for form designer. We initially started adding stories with some basic details and a few images of the sketch and later did the estimation. We showcased it to Arjun, Vivek and Vinay and noted the changes suggested by them, to include them in the stories later.
By the end of the first week, we were at a stage where we had the stories and estimation ready. Swapnil had already begun the work and I was supposed to take up the new form mapping story next week. We not only learnt ReactJS but also understood the importance of using pen and paper in this digital world.
On each of these days, we had a quick stand-up call. This made collaboration with the team easy and we could incorporate each other?s ideas. Also, I must add – each day, we enjoyed the delicious lunch served at Samanvay :-).
We had a few suggestions from our new friends on the places to visit during the weekend. On Saturday, we decided to explore Mysore. We visited some great places like The Mysore Palace, Chamundi hills and Saint Philomena’s church. Our stay at the hotel (more of a hostel really) – Backpacker’s panda was great!

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2021
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/overcoming-gender-mental-health-issues-among-14-17yr-olds-through-a-two-way-chat-program/
==================================================

WeUnlearn is an NGO that empowers adolescents from low-income families with knowledge and resources to lead emotionally resilient and gender equitable lives. They had been conducting pilots with 20-30 children on facebook messenger, website but they had not really been generating the desired engagement. Moreover, the right tools and methods to measure the impact were not available.
Two important considerations:
A ready tech solution to launch the program
Reach a large number of children
and serendipity got them connected to Donald Lobo and Glific. They decided to test two modules using the chatbot solution, one on bullying and one on gender stereotypes. The curriculum was designed to increase the awareness around these issues and inculcate essential life skills like negotiation, persuasion, assertive communication to overcome the issues. The resource was scheduled to be sent to the students everyday at a particular time on their WhatsApp numbers. Each knowledge resource was followed by a round of questions to check what the students learnt and retained. On avg. the children engaged with the program for about 10mins everyday.
At the end of 2-weeks, the WeUnlearn team saw a shift of about 10-15% point change, with most of the results being statistically significant in the gender attitude of the children and the way they perceived gender equality. The students exchanged about 1,50,865 messages with the bot and wanted to keep going even after the pilot had ended.
�When I went to the field & interacted with the children, they loved the platform & wanted to continue engaging with the bot.
– Pallavi Khare, Co-Founder, WeUnlearn
The chatbot relied on WhatsApp based automated messaging and content delivery. Reaching children where they are at, seemed to be much more effective in delivering the program and continuing their learning and education. It provided an opportunity for the children to interact with the bot and learn in a fun and engaging manner.
Heres a snippet of how the bot worked:
https://youtu.be/AJBvpD-CHQw
WeUnlearn team conducted multiple field visits,spoke to more than 200 adolescent children to identify the pain points and accordingly prepared the content. They designed a robust evaluation (a randomized control trial) to measure the effectiveness of the chatbot and deployed the baseline and endline via the chatbot itself. They also tested the program internally with the team and a set of 10-12 contacts to make sure the messages had been set up the way they envisioned, and that the program was ready to scale to an even larger number of students. Heres what their journey looked like:
Abhishek: How did you create the cohort of students and deployed your program?
Pallavi: We partnered with a Delhi based organization that has a large community of 20,000 students from low-income families. They already had a structure to train students for english and run vocational programs. They welcomed our idea to run our program to their students. From the partners, we got a good network of mentors and facilitators who further managed their group of 50 students each. These mentors & facilitators helped in deploying our program by getting students to engage with the bot. As the children trusted the facilitators, there was no reason for us to connect directly.
We also had a good team structure that consisted of a great project lead(who would think in advance about all the things that could go wrong), content team, and implementation team to work with the facilitators.
We created a whatsapp group with all the facilitators, and trained them how to run the program. Glific platform helped us monitor the students who were engaged and those who were not. Facilitators catalysed by following up with the children.
We also shared an onboarding video to the children on how to use and interact with the bot. We provided the required instructions to the facilitators on what to do – they already had whatsapp groups with the children so they sent a link to the students to initiate conversation with the bot.
A: How did you ensure engagement with the students throughout the program?
P: We realised that the usage will differ for each student, and monitoring how students are interacting with the bot would be required. In the first few days, we onboarded about 8 volunteers who would spend a couple of hours a day monitoring if some students were getting stuck anywhere. They would reach out to the facilitators who would then nudge the student to continue the program or help them where required. The facilitators also reported back to us how many students completed the interaction for the day – this was nicely managed by our project lead.
We centered our content around the children using examples of movies they liked, people they are familiar with and kept it relatable overall. Asking a few questions everyday and checking how they would apply the knowledge was important to ensuring engagement.
We had a good number of students who continued the program to the end, but still there were quite a few drop offs along the way. But running this program opened up a lot of insights on how to improve the questions, creating a really smooth flow throughout the program, which would be different from NGO to NGO but the good thing about having a system is that – what did not work – can be quantified, measured and improved upon.
A: How did you go about creating content for the program?
P: Meghna from our team spent a long time on the field interviewing about 200 students understanding their pain points. Our content was centered around the children and their pain points. We focused on a 3 step process: awareness (of the challenges), skilling (such as persuasion, negotiation to overcome the issue), action (we gave them a challenge to practice change) for our program.
We structured the program such that students could spend a few minutes every day on it. After identifying the program content and conversational flow, setting it up on Glific was pretty smooth. We kept the intervention simple. The user interface was easy to use and we were set up in no time. Building the entire bot in such a less time would have been a big challenge, but just setting up the content and conversations was easy.
A: How did you measure your program impact?
P: We extracted the data from BigQuery which basically gave us the baseline and endline responses that each of the control groups answered. We compared the before and after data to analyse the significance of the impact.
We had a strong focus on evaluation because it is one of the most important aspects of demonstrating impact and securing program funding and donations. During my time at Gates foundation I saw many NGOs run a lot of amazing programs but they did not have the data to show for it. A good standard of evaluation is also important for early stage NGOs.
Being able to deploy the program, with surveys, easily through Glific enabled us to support our program with data.
A: What was the most important part of running the program?
P: The project lead was the most important. They played a crucial role in anticipating the pitfalls, preparing for it and keeping it moving forward.
A: How did Glific help you in all of this?
P: Glific was a blessing because we could not have run our program in the short time period otherwise. We would not have the integration with WhatsApp, designed and built a bot to support our program. We would not have been able to test it and launch it at a large scale so fast as well. It came to us at the right time and it seems like the right platform for NGOs. Even the cost seems fair, in comparison to what it would cost us to build and run it all on our own.
The user interface was really good, we got all our team members onboarded it in no time; even the volunteers got started quickly and were able to use the platform well.Title: Overview: Deploying Glific on AWS ECS fargate with CD in place
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: September 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/overview-deploying-glific-on-aws-ecs-fargate-with-cd-in-place/
==================================================

The Glific project is being built by a distributed team, working across timezones. In addition to that, we have sub-teams for frontend and backend applications. This results in short release cycles, where we fix issues and release them quickly. To allow for quick integration and assessment of the work, the need for Continuous Integration and deployment was felt. That ensured the UAT was always up to date with the latest code for the product development team to look at.
In Glific, we decided to deploy and avail the changes at the staging site as soon as it got merged, and we needed the CD implementation.
We used the following AWS infrastructure to achieve the target goal. We are not going in the technical implementation but on the overview of how we have set it up currently, and why we went with this setup.
Tech stack in Glific:
We had the following tech stack and we were thinking about the possibilities of different infrastructures.
React JS for frontend application.
Phoenix/Elixir for backend API.
Postgres database.
How to eat an elephant? Cut it down into pieces and take one piece at a time. Have that resilience to make sure you finish that elephant.
Following the same philosophy, we divided the whole process into two different phases
Phase 1:
Dockerizing both the applications.
Phase 2:
Designing and implementing a CD compatible infrastructure.
Phase 1: Dockerizing the applications
Both applications are fully dockerized. We can create the latest docker image and run it in any stack compatible with docker.
Why did we go with a docker based setup?
We researched and found there are lots of advantages of going with a dockerized setup.
Compatibility and maintainability:
We found it most compatible as It provides a consistent environment for CD. After the initial setup effort, it has low maintenance cost compared to non containerized applications.
Rapid development:
It has comparatively low deployment time as we can easily put a new version of the software into production rapidly and if anything goes, we can quickly roll back to a previous version.
Isolation:
It ensures that each container has its resources and runs a separate application that is isolated from other containers. You can have various containers for separate applications running completely different stacks.
Check out how I’ve implemented it in my another blog on
Continuous integration & deployment for open source project
.
Phase 2: Designing and implementing a CD compatible infrastructure.
As we dockerized both applications in phase 1, it was the time to get benefited.
The tech stack we used to design our infrastructure are:
AWS ECS fargate for deploying containerized applications.
AWS ECR for storing docker images.
AWS ELB for handling network traffic.
AWS CodePipeline for implementing CD.
RDS for the database.
Why Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)?
Amazon ECS
is a highly scalable and high-performance container orchestration (automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems) service meant to support Docker-based containerized applications to run and scale as needed. You don’t need to manage the infrastructure or other operations such as tasks, services, auto-scaling, etc.
Why Fargate?
AWS Fargate
is a serverless launch type for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers. You don’t have to manage servers or clusters,  provision, configurations, and scaling clusters to run containers.
ECS gives two choices, either we go with EC2 or Fargate. We found the following reason to go with Fargate.
Resource utilization:
Most of the time, the EC2 instance doesn’t utilize the resources correctly while If you are using Fargate, you don’t need to think about managing those resources.
Automation:
It reduces manual intervention, Fargate task configurations (definition) seamlessly meets the application’s computing requirements.
Autoscaling capability:
If your application needs more resources and you have enabled this, you don’t need to worry about how you will scale it further whenever required.
Pricing:
Fargate Launch Type, billing is based on CPU or memory requirements per second. You only have to pay for what your task uses, no need to pay for extra for EC2 instances that go unused.
Deploying with ECS Fargate
To deploy our Glific applications on ECS, we need the following 4 items set up.
Container Definition:
It includes the configurations of a container that includes where we are getting docker image, which port we are exposing, environmental variables, hard/soft CPU limits which Task definition will use to run the container.
Task Definition:
This contains the definition that describes how a docker container should launch. It contains settings like CPU shares, memory requirements, etc.
Service:
It enables us to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster. ie. It helps us run single or multiple containers all using the same Task Definition.
Cluster:
It is a logical group of container instances that ECS can use for deploying Docker containers.
Here is how it looks when we successfully deployed our applications on ECS.
Why AWS ECR?
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), which is a private
Docker Registry
managed by AWS. Though we can use the docker hub repository, seeing compatibility with Fargate and CodePipeline, I preferred to use ECR over the docker hub to store docker images we are building using the AWS CodePipeline.
Elastic Load balancer (ELB) for external routing.
We are using AWS Elastic load balancer for external routing. As we have two different applications, we used different Load balancers for each application.
ALB (Application Load Balancer) for handling frontend traffic.
NLB (Network Load Balancer) for handling backend API traffic.
Why we are using NLB (Network Load Balancer) for the backend application?
The glific backend is using socket requests for live chat which uses custom TCP and ALB only provides HTTP/HTTPS. To make the socket connection work, we needed an NLB that supports custom TCP.
RDS for the database
In Glific, we are using the Postgres database. Seeing the advantages, RDS is a good choice for our application. It provides high availability, scalability, and performance. It also provides the Backup mechanism whether that is automated or Point-in-Time snapshots which the user initiates.
AWS codepipeline for implementing CD
AWS CodePipeline is an
Amazon Web Services
for CI/CD of applications hosted on various AWS platforms. It automates the software deployment process allowing a developer to quickly model, visualize, and deliver code for new features and updates.
Our CodePipeline is consisting of three different stages:
Source:
We are using GitHub as a source code repository. This step checks for any changes on a specific branch (configured while creating this step) and pulls the code changes.
Build:
This stage uses the codebase available after running step 1, builds the docker image, and pushes it to the ECR.
Deploy:
This stage is responsible to deploy the latest docker image to AWS ECS (Fargate) service.
It creates a replica of the old ECS task and runs it parallel with the old one. If the deployment fails due to any reason, it stops the new task but the old task remains up.
If everything goes well, it triggers a health check on a new task, and on success, it stops the old task.
The benefit of using an AWS CodePipeline for an AWS ECS service is that the ECS service continues to run while a new Docker image is built and deployed. So the user will not be facing any downtime in between.
Conclusion:
Containers are becoming standard of the industry to deploy and run applications. We are successfully able to deploy the whole Glific solution with the CD in place.
We also went through the serverless deployment of applications as Amazon Fargate allowed us to specify our service requirements without going deeper into managing EC2 infrastructure.
The CodePipeline uses the CodeBuild which builds and pushes the docker image to ECR which ECS is using for task deployment.
Step 3 of CodePipeline deploys the application to ECS by using ECS task definition that too without any downtime for the user.
I’ll be posting the blog consisting of a detailed step by step deployment guideline. Stay in touch for the updates.Title: People+AI

Bangalore International Centre, May 7 2024
By Rohit Chatterjee and Thomas Mampilly
Yesterday the two of us had the privilege of being invited to attend an event hosted by
people+ai
at BIC in Bangalore. We did not know what to expect so we showed up with open minds for the three-hour-long event.
The theme of the presentations was building population-scale digital public infrastructure for AI. The organisers included the team who built Aadhaar and UPI, which was good to know because when people make predictions or give advice you always want to know why you should listen to them.
The Big Picture
The evening kicked off with Tanuj Bhojwani, who heads up people+ai, asking a simple question: “Can we have a future where technology serves us and not the other way around?” A question set up by examples of how we have gotten used to adapting our lives to the demands of SEO, social media attention and the like. Is AI the answer?
Tanuj posits four essential components to unlock the potential of AI in India:
Use cases to build for
Infrastructure to scale
Community of builders with space to experiment and grow
Advisors and cheerleaders to accelerate growth
AI applications
The sessions started with a presentation by
Driefcase
, who onboard patients at government hospitals onto the
ABDM
. The ABDM identity, called ABHA, allows patients to share their medical histories with healthcare providers. Registration is not simple for everyone, so Driefcase built an app to help. With a simple app they were able to reduce waiting times for doctors appointments from 4 hours to a few minutes, and when they noticed that this still wasn’t good enough they enhanced it with a chatbot which users can speak with to lead them through the process and address any concerns they might have. And to close the loop they allow users to provide feedback on the service they received.
Next was
Sarvam AI
which provides a natural-language interface to create a WhatsApp chatbot.
Users provide their knowledge-base for their chatbot to refer to, APIs to external services which their chatbot can connect to, and descriptions of how the chatbot should work. Sarvam AI then creates the chatbot to this spec.
Next up was
Stage
, an Indian language video platform that currently serves content in Haryanvi and Rajasthani, who demoed an AI voice customer service agent that could respond to questions around a trial subscription, its cost and automatic renewal. Impressive considering the interaction was in Haryanvi and the AI agent was able to retain context and successfully direct the customer to a satisfactory call closure. Use cases for this kind of tech in the social sector abound: from AI interviewer-assisted surveys to health-related triage. I’m excited to see how we can experiment and leverage this in the near term.
Rohit’s favourite demo from this session was by Setu who unveiled an LLM called Sesame. The first use-case was for users to upload bank statements to the LLM which reads them and creates summary reports on inflows and spending, all through WhatsApp (TBH I’m not certain it was WhatsApp… it looked like WA on the screen though). The next one was even better, through the chat interface a user can talk about a planned purchase, get information, product recommendations, and even place an order. It was pretty impressive.
Compute Capacity
After a few more AI presentations, the organisers addressed the obvious question – “where is all the compute power going to come from?”
The first presentation in this session was by
Vigyan Labs
, who built an air-cooled solar-powered micro-data centre in Mysore. The building sits on a modest plot of land, is maybe three storeys high, and is so energy-efficient that they give surplus power back to the electrical grid.
Von Neumann AI has built a PC-sized AI server for 2 lakhs; it’s tiny and you can see it in the photograph below:
(It wasn’t clear who the target market is, but it could be MSMEs and NGOs).
Looking ahead
The evening ended with a keynote by Nandan Nilekani, in which he said
Start your AI deployments now, don’t wait. Make mistakes, learn etc
Don’t chase the big parameter models, we can do a lot with less
Attack the population-scale problems
Private players on Public “rails”
There is money to be made at high volumes
What the sessions told us though was a) look, people are doing this already, and b) we haven’t solved the shortage of compute power yes but people are working on it. So don’t wait.
In fact, the entire event was intended to tell people to Start Now. With LLMs and their applications progressing as fast as they have been, and without good estimates or heuristics on costs, it’s natural for some innovators to want to “wait for clarity”. For those on the fence, People+AI aimed to give them a little nudge, a little boost of confidence.Title: Pesky Discussions on Impact and Learning and Iconic Mumbai Restaurants

==================================================

It started, as many good things do, with food ! 🙂
Lobo bribed me. Not in the shady way – I mean Soam, Britannia & Co., berry pulav and all. That kind of bribe. Between bites, we ended up talking about tough questions, hard truths, and all the usual Tech4Dev soul-searching. You know, the stuff like:
“What are we really doing here?”, “Is this impact?”, “Are we just automating some things and calling it transformation?”
This trip was a swirl of meetings – from Educate Girls to Magic Bus to Jai Vakil, with folks from Omidyar, Dasra, and ATE Chandra Foundation thrown in for good measure. It was a lot. Good people, big ideas, thoughtful pushbacks. But if there was a thread running through it all in resonance with prior discussions over food and drinks as well, it was this:
What does impact really look like for Tech4Dev?
Because let’s be honest – in my mind this has always been a thorny one. We’re not the ones running the programs on the ground. We don’t teach the kids, help folks with their health issues, or skill the youth. So what are we measuring? Is it just the number of NGOs we work with or that use our platforms? The features in our platforms and what it may enable? The “fractional CxO” count of NGOs we work with and some esoteric notions of innovation, efficiency etc.?
It can’t just be reach, right ? That feels shallow. To me it’s got to be deeper. Is it – are we helping create organizations that
learn
? That adapt based on what the data tells them? That experiment, evaluate, and evolve faster? Are we helping close the loop between impact and intervention? Because if tech, data, and AI aren’t enabling that kind of feedback loop – well, what are we doing here?
The most exciting chats were with teams that had started to crack this – like Magic Bus. Their use of tech isn’t flashy, it’s foundational. Monitoring, evaluating, learning, tweaking and all feeding into their larger goal of equipping young people to thrive, work, and contribute meaningfully. It’s the wiring that makes the loop possible. Seeing their growth in program scale, people and funding over the last four years makes one think that this is possible. Of course, for the “funders won’t fund this” wall. But honestly? That’s a false binary. Yes, funders want programs and projects. But they also want impact. If we can show how tech and data help improve programs, adapt them, measure them better — why wouldn’t that be fundable? We just need to tell that story better. Build that mindset across orgs. Gather the ones who’ve made this leap — in education, health, skilling, youth development — and get them to talk. Share. Reflect. Repeat. Not a one-and-done. More like a running series of talks that maybe we can hope to contribute towards – this had a lot of synergies with multiple folks we talked to and definitely an action for us at Tech4Dev to move this along.
Then thinking deeper about the Fractional CxO program. How do we measure impact there? Level jumps? CSAT scores? Those are easy, and maybe too easy. What we really want to see is transformation – smoother monitoring, faster evaluation, bolder experiments. That’s harder to track. But far more important. If I had to put a number on it, I’d say maybe 25% of the orgs we work with are getting close to this. Pessimistic-me thinks that. Optimistic-me thinks maybe, just maybe, we’re laying the right stepping stones for the rest. Lobo and I went back and forth on this with
Lobo being the optimist
🙂
And yes, some of the Mumbai team had
no idea
what Britannia & Co. was. Tragic. Can’t believe that the new generations (dating myself here) are missing out on these iconic restaurants.
Also, if anyone can figure out the cash-only setup in the restaurant involving a guy sitting on a chair outside who you GPay to and get the cash (
ala
human ATM) with no commission fee… is this a hawala scheme? Whitewashing money for the whole neighborhood? A social experiment? We spent a a bit of time on the multitude of ways this could make sense. But that’s the thing. Like the mystery of the Britannia cashier or the elusive metric of “real impact,” we may not have the full answer yet.
But we’re asking better questions, and we’re in good company while we ask them.
And that’s not a bad place to be.

==================================================

As I work more in the social sector and also hear and learn from other CxOs, free technology development is a buzzword and gets a lot of NGO staff really excited about it. Being a skeptic on any free stuff, this has been a difficult subject to navigate personally. And to reiterate the obvious point that I am not against free stuff (we do it for our platforms all the time too :)); it is great that NGOs can leverage free but the downsides are something that should be considered by NGOs to make a more informed decision rather than the excitement of free stuff.
The various flavors of free:
Help get our product started and you can be onboarded on it with all your custom stuff
Foundation technology grant to do something at the intersection of NGO and foundation interests
CSR/funder connected volunteers doing pro-bono work
Corporate hackathons coming from corporate funders
(Free/Cheap) College internships
Not going to go into detail on all the free benefits but talk more about what I see as questions that NGOs should answer for themselves when they venture into these free developments:
Is there a clear-cut idea of what is being developed and towards what end goal? Is it a proof of concept or a full fledged application that needs to integrate into other applications?
We see NGOs engage in these opportunities with requirements that are more conceptual but then end up wanting to integrate this POC completely into their systems. With the morphing of requirements, sustainability and maintainability become big issues over time.
How are we thinking of managing product quality so that our staff time is not wasted dealing with a buggy product introduction in the field?
Do we have in-house tech personnel to vet the development to ensure standards are followed and a reasonably bug-free product is delivered ?
Free projects typically do not have automated testing of the code and end up relying on users to test the product. Do we have a phased testing plan to pro-actively at least validate software functioning of the system (it might still be a black box from a code perspective) and are we ready to spend the time for this ?
In a lot of these free builds,NGOs dont control the technologies used and do not have in-house capacity to help assess quality of the development leading to questionable maintainability and sustainability over time.
Do we plan to maintain the software and build on it ?
Long term sustainability of what has been built is a huge concern. Most of the free development typically does not involve maintenance over time and this can be a big hassle for NGOs if deployed into production to find outside vendors who can get up to speed on what has been developed with technologies that could be out of the wheelhouse of the NGOs regular vendors.
Documentation on free development is typically lacking leading to lack of knowledge transfer.
Can we deal with the amorphous nature of these projects especially related to timelines ?
Free development work typically has long timelines and invariably blown deadlines. Most of these free engagements are long drawn out affairs and can be time consuming for project teams to keep abreast of especially with typically no firm commitments from the other side as it is free
Will this project address a unified tech strategy for our organization and is that required for this project ?
Reusability of code and leveraging across similar developments is very unlikely as developers on these free projects work in a silo and are not very privy to other developments across the organization to take a platform view.
A careful consideration of these questions and answers for them might well make us walk away from the opportunity and that is A-ok as in the words of Jay-Z –
Im not concerned with noise because Im playing the long game.

Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

It?s been a week that our team has been interacting with various NGOs. Throwing multitudes of questions at them and learning everything we can about their interaction with their community of influence (or beneficiaries). They?ve been walking us through their processes which covers what they communicate and how. We?ve been hearing about their experiences with some of the tools and technologies they used in the past and what they continue to use. We?ve interacted with NGOs from various domains such as Education, Health and well-being, Hunger etc? It?s all for an?
open-source communication platform
?we?re building.
Designing a product for an idea requires a deep understanding of the challenge beyond the idea that lies on the surface. The idea itself can contain a lot of possibilities without a clear direction on what to build. We had started with the idea of building ?a two-way communication platform to connect NGOs and their communities?, and as we?re talking to various NGOs, we?re uncovering a lot more insights that will give a direction and definition to the product. The team has been documenting the interviews to generate insights. Apart from getting a good grip on what we?ll build, the research part of the product journey itself is worth looking at. From here on, you can see the steps I followed for the research and the outcomes generated against again each step.
1. Creating a category of users to be researched
People can connect with their most immediate challenges as per their positioning, and show us some opportunities as to how things could be made better. Hence, some very specific insights can be generated from users based on which side of the product knowledge they lie on. Three major categories in our case are ?
Those who communicate with their community but don?t use any kind of tools/technologies yet
Those users who communicate using some existing products, which could be their own custom-built platforms or marketplace products
Those who have been using our product and can share the experience. As there is no product and corresponding customer base yet, my current research doesn?t cover this third category (but maybe later).
2. Setting a goal for research ? preparing a questionnaire
We prepared a list of questions to ask these different groups. It helped in referring for each meeting and revising the questions for relevance and desired insight. For our product, from the first group(who do not use a tool) we learnt their communication requirements, how it contributes to their organizational goal, their processes, whether they had any prior experience with a tool/technology, how they measure impact from communications, the size of community they interact with.
From the second group(who use some tools) we learnt some gaps and opportunities, how their tools align with their organizational goal, their prior experience with tools before reaching the current one, some of their most used features, story points for what other NGOs can learn from them. The point of matter here was not really to learn about their products, instead, focus on how well or not were their communication needs being met and go a step further from the first group of users.
Apart from this list, we also asked questions along the way to uncover their experiences wherever we saw the opportunity to dig deeper. This was required because the user may not fall in the same strict categorization as we started with.
3. Approaching and connecting with the user base
Partnering with Tech4Dev, we had an exposure of probable users we could readily reach out to. Tech4Dev supported in setting up interviews with the NGOs.
However, from my previous experience when researching another product we were building at
ColoredCow
, I prepared a list of contact persons from organizations I wanted to target (who fit the category and goal). Then wrote to them talking about their work and requesting for a short call to hear about their experience. Adding few points on how my research was relevant for their organisation, must have prompted many to respond back. You can append this knowledge with how to conduct interviews by knowing more about the setting, drawing people in and other behavioural aspects in a book ?
Just enough research
? by Erika Hall.
4. Documenting the insights
Team took notes and collated all the information received from our users. Then it was time for
some synthesis of information
to be made. Not the part where it helps to build requirements but just to sift through the gold and the most essential part which will support product definition.
My documentation structure includes ?
?Mapping with organisational goals?
: to always be thinking how the product will help the users achieve what they?re already set out for, and align with their goals. If they want to automate some part of the communication, and be able to send personalized messages at their will then our product should be aligned with that goal.
?Gaps and opportunities?
: this covers the challenges they face now without tools, and the unresolved challenges that persist despite the tools. Our interactions many times brought some really interesting aspects that we may not have identified without them. They even shared some opportunities they felt could improve the product further such as the ability for our chat platform to automatically detect whether a number is a whatsapp no. or not.
?Proof for other NGOs?
: I also found it useful to learn at this stage itself some key stories and stats that can serve as case studies for others. It included both positive impact they achieved and negative experiences from failed solutions, to influence the new users for the platform as per the stage they belong in.
These interviews have given a boost and a sense of direction we need to walk on. There?s a shape emerging out of the abstract light but we need to put it down on the paper again. Each of the team members has a sense of what this product will do but we all need to be aligned and be walking on one path. We need to beat the iron while it?s hot to give it the shape we want. Each strike is reinforced by what we learnt from the interviews ready to forge a product that will cut through the communication challenges of NGOs. With the purpose and product in mind, we?ll continue to research, to make room for the diverse use case the product will need to cater to.Title: Progress on Project Lakeer

==================================================

After our initial engagement with Lakeer, at their office in Hyderabad, we identified that there were 2 areas needing technology support, which could bring in a significant change in their day to day work.
1. QGIS
One
of the 2 areas is, once the Lakeer team has the curated geotagged
json with them, loading it to QGIS for doing further analysis, by
every team member, takes a long time. A lot of time is spent by every
team member, waiting, before they can start actual work on QGIS.
Second issue of this approach is keeping the data in sync with the
website. Here, the team has to create geo json through QGIS and wait
till the developer migrates the file to the database.
Solution
The
solution we came up here was building a QGIS plugin – that would go
into the QGIS desktop application of every team member. The plugin is
a 2-way channel, where data once loaded through JSON file, can be
saved to a central database by a team member playing the admin role.
The QGIS application on each team member?s desktop, directly loads
the json, from the central database.
This
solution brings in two improvements, namely, the load time is reduced
and it also gets rid of data duplication.
Technology
stack used
PYQT5
Python
QGIS
	3.6
2. Web Reporting?
The
second important aspect of Lakeer’s work is displaying the impact of
their work to common citizens. Lakeer already has an intranet site
called “CitySight”. This is a web based, open source,
geospatial tool. CitySight helps the urban administrators to measure
and improve city health.
But
the reach of CitySight is limited to mostly the city office
bureaucrats or Lakeer team themselves. Also the geospatial tools
built in CitySight, provide more of analysis, which probably a layman
may not understand. To circumvent this, Lakeer was looking for a web
based Reporting solution, which could reach masses easily. The idea
was to share the success stories of Lakeer’s work with the people
from the city.
After
talking to the founder, Dipika, we realized that she was looking for
a web-based reporting where she / her team could manage not just the
content but also the content layout on the fly – based on the data
available for that issue, at that point of time.
For
example the reporting tool could have the ability to show an issue
reported with before and after photos, to bring forth the impact. Or
it may have analysis charts, graphs or may be heat maps overlaid on a
map. Over and above, she is also looking forward to have some textual
content, highlighting the key points, on the same site. We built an
early prototype, that had thumbnails of news articles, twitter handle
etc. with links to appropriate pages. This idea was approved by the
Lakeer team. Besides this, Deepika also suggested of having a way for
citizens to comment on each success story.
Solution
and Technology stack used
Considering
the kind of flexibility that Deepika and her team were looking for in
the reporting tool, we decided to go ahead with WordPress to build a
single page web based application for her needs.
A
couple of WordPress plugins that we used here are?
Simple
	custom JS and CS
Simple
	custom CSS
Post
	Grid
Advanced
	Custom Fields
In the coming few weeks we plan to test and deploy these changes on to the Lakeer server, for the Lakeer team to start using it and share their feedback with us.

==================================================

The
initial engagement with four NGOs, implementing READ program in Pune,
helped us understand the commonalities and differences in their way
of functioning
Before
jumping to the solution we proposed for READ, it is important to
understand the way, READ program is implemented at these NGOs. To
give you an essence of it, here?s a quick overview of the program ?
At
	the start of the academic year, the NGOs, lay down their time tables
	for various classes in various schools (Both Doorstep and Swadhar
	work in close collaboration with schools, and have a session
	scheduled every week for each primary standard class in the school)
And
	during each of these session, the NGO teacher (Doorstep calls it
	Pustak Pari or Book Fairy), does a lot of work from taking
	attendance, to conducting games which would keep the child engaged
	throughout the session, to interacting with every child, and later
	after getting back home, putting down comments / notes for every
	child in a ledger.
Besides,
	the NGOs also plan evaluation of every child at regular intervals.
	So, the Pustak Pari has a task of noting down these evaluations in a
	separate ledger.
At
	some later point of time, a data entry person at the respective NGO,
	then keys in data in all different ledgers into Excel files. The
	NGOs then use the Excel data, as per their taste, to get different
	reports.
Based on above gist, the functioning of the program involves a lot of data capture by the NGO teacher. And this data is very crucial for READ, as it helps them, analyze the difference they are bringing into reading ability of each child.
Based
on above gist, the functioning of the program involves a lot of data
capture by the NGO teacher. And this data is very crucial for READ,
as it helps them, analyze the difference they are bringing into
reading ability of each child.
So,
we concluded, that the way we could intervene in READ program and
improve their work was, to eradicate manual data capture. Thereby, we
decided to build a solution consisting of 2 parts.
Android app ? for data entry and
Website ? for planning weekly sessions, storing school information along with funders and managing the NGO user for various operations.
Android
App
The
android app, is aimed mainly at the NGO teachers (or Book Fairies).
The Book Fairy could use the app, either in her class, or after
reaching home, in an offline mode, to make her notes/evaluations for
every child.
And,
when the app comes into network connectivity, it would automatically
sync the data with the server.
Website
The
second part of the solution was website.
The
website would be used for ?
Setting
	up NGOs, their users, and the tasks each user can perform.
Storing
	school information, along with some specifics like, is it a co-ed
	school, does it fall under PMC etc. which is later on used for both
	data analysis as well as applying for funding.
Laying
	down timetable for every school?s every class, for the entire
	academic year.
Maintaining
	an inventory of books used during the sessions as well as those used
	for home lending.
And
	reporting at various levels ? like reporting at the NGO level to
	analyze their progress across various schools, wards etc., reporting
	at the READ program level to get an idea of what methodology is
	making READ achieve its vision of developing reading abilities in a
	child. And lastly there also are reports for funders.
When
architecting the technology solutions for READ, one important
decision we made was to provide multi-lingual support for both the
app as well the website. This was considering the fact that, the Book
fairies, who are the main source of data collection, as well as other
set of users, who would be interacting with the site on a day-to-day
basis, may not necessarily be well versed with English. So, not just
the captions on the website / app would supporting Marathi, but the
teachers would be able to make all the data entry as well in Marathi.
However, we decided that numbers would be entered in English, so that
the analysis becomes easier later.
Challenges
faced ?
True
that the solution we provide, would be beneficial to multiple NGOs,
implementing the READ program. But, involvement of multiple NGOs also
posed some problems like ?
Each
	NGO had their own set of terminology used for several things ?
	like for Doorstep, the NGO teachers are known as Book Fairy (Pustak
	Pari), versus for Swadhar it is something different. The child
	evaluation scale for some NGOs are color codes, versus some other
	NGOs uses flower names as evaluation codes and a third variety is a
	simple scale of letter A to D
Each
	NGO had their own twists of READ program implementation ? like
	some were involved in home lending of books to schools while others
	were not. Some NGOs intervened through only primary standard classes
	in schools, while others were involved into pre-primary sections as
	well.
Data
	captured by NGOs differed
So,
all this led to providing several configurations in the system, so
that one solution, could cater needs of multiple NGOs
Tech
Stack –
We
decided to use
Django : Django was the choice for server development. It is stable, open source and has good i18n support. We used the DRF (Django Rest Framework) library for API development.
React JS : Since we expected to replicate some functionality in the app and website, we decided to develop the frontend using a web app technology rather than server-side rendering. We went with React for the frontend.
PostgreSQL
As
of today, the website part is mostly done, except the reports. The
metadata like NGO, school, class etc. capture by individual NGOs can
now start around the last week of April.
When this is happening at the NGO end, we plan to work on the reports, so that they can start using it from the coming academic year.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Avni

==================================================

ASHWINI Hospital
ASHWINI
is a registered charitable society established in 1990. Its primary objective is to establish an
accessible, effective and sustainable health system that is owned by the community
.  The organisation runs in community ownership model and the program addresses the needs of more than 20000 Adivasis spread over 320 hamlets in the Gudalur Valley of the Nilgiri hills in South India.
ASHWINI has a hospital as well as community health program.
Hospital
Gudalur Adivasi Hospital (GAH) is a 50-bedded hospital that provides both out-patient and in-patient services along with an in-house laboratory and pharmacy.
They have been using Bahmni, an open-source hospital system, since 2015
. The software holds medical records of patients as well as billing and lab data.
Community health program
The community health program runs with a 3-tier framework with Village health volunteers at the base, Area centres and health animators at the 2nd tier and GAH at the third tier. The key focus of the work is on maternal and child health (MCH). Other special programs include:
Sickle cell anaemia program
Tuberculosis
Mental health
Nutrition Intervention
Screening programs
The community program is already using
Avni
, an open-source fieldwork platform, since 2019. They have been using Avni so far only for the MCH.
However now they wanted to expand the usage and utility of Avni. Hence they asked Tech4Dev support for Bahmni-Avni Integration and addition of new modules to already deployed instance of Avni.
The project started in December 2019, initially with detailed requirements gathering including a site visit for face to face discussion.
Bahmni-Avni Integration
Doctors: The tribal patients have two main points of contact for care; the hospital and the area centre or village where the health animator sees them. When a patient with a chronic illness is seen by the doctor, it is important to understand what was the treatment provided in the field. For eg: we have over 300 patients with a chronic debilitating illness called sickle cell anaemia. With the villages being far out, they cannot come to the hospital every month. They are treated in the area centre. It is important for the doctor to see this treatment history. Health Animators: They would be doing a reverse of this and be able to see what medicines have been prescribed for the patient.
Hence they envision a system where both the community health and the hospital software talk to each other and exchange essential data.
Initially, it was understood that the integration will be achieved allowing the users to navigate to dashboards of the beneficiary in the two systems. After understanding their requirements
Samanvay Foundation
, partner on this project, recommended that to meet the expected use-cases, deeper integration is required where data flows from Avni to Bahmni and vice-versa.
Project Scope and Development
By the time the scope was getting finalised in April, COVID-19 crisis had engulfed all of the world and Tech4Dev also decided to keep the funding to minimal for all its projects. Thus Tech4Dev decided to remove Bahmni-Avni integration from the scope of the project. The scope was kept limited to the addition of following modules and reports
Death
Family planning
Sickle Cell
Chronic sickness
TB
Mental health

==================================================

This project is for Community Medicine Department of
Yenepoya (Deemed to be University)
. Yenepoya is located in the vibrant, multi-cultural and coastal city of
Mangalore
, Karnataka.
Department of community medicine engages in the following activities
Assess the health needs of the community and plan and implement appropriate need-based health interventions.
To provide quality community-oriented medical education to the undergraduate and postgraduate medical students
To create social physicians capable of providing comprehensive care
To conduct socially relevant field-based research
To facilitate the implementation of National Health Programmes in coordination with district health and family welfare departments.
This project is to develop an IT system for their
Health and Demographic Surveillance program or “Kutumba Aarogya Sarvekshana Hagu Rakhsana Yojane”
. The platform is to enable them with the following:
Change from paper-based data capture to paper-less (Electronic format)
Community-based efficient, quality data capture, analysis and reporting.
The transition from survey to surveillance.
Geospatial mapping of health problems and diseases with respect to time, place and person distribution.
Understanding of the disease trends by collecting longitudinal data
Addition of new projects and variables in the established IT platform.
Monitoring and supportive supervision of field staff.
Capture data from special groups on a periodic basis like
Pregnant mothers, lactating mothers, children less than 5 years, adolescents, individuals with Diabetes, Individuals with Hypertension, NCD (Non communicable Disease) risk factors (18-60 years), Geriatric population and fever survey (last 15 years)
.
Surveillance studies it is empirical to have real-time, continuous data monitoring and relational data capture through IT platform for assessing health needs and planning health services
The project is to cater to the need of a population of 1 lakh in the first year. The IT system is to be used by a team 60 users comprising of field workers, supervisors, a program coordinator, a program manager and a statistician.
The project started in the month of Dec 2019. Requirements, scope and solution were identified through a series of online discussions as well as 1 one-day face-to-face workshop in their department.
The project will be done by
Samanvay Foundation
as an implementation of open-source fieldwork platform
Avni
.
Most of the requirements will be met by existing features present in Avni. Following features were identified as gaps and decided to be added to the platform through this project
Household Support
A need was also identified to add a feature to send SMS to the beneficiaries. However, this was deprioritised after discussion with them.
Scope was finalised and development started in the month of April 2020.
On a lighter note, in my visit to Mangalore for the face-to-face, Dr Abhay, head of department of community medicine and our PoC took me around the city. And it was a delight to visit one of these grand ice-cream parlours which I thought are something quite unique to the city. They have some amazing varieties. While ‘
Gadbad
‘ is most popular I liked their ‘
iPizza’
more! Do try it out when you happen to be in the city 🙂

==================================================

Centre for Equity Studies
was founded in 2000. The organization works with a rights-based approach and is engaged in research and advocacy on issues of social justice. It seeks to inquire into nature and causes of social justice and collectively, through research and action projects find methods of moving towards an equitable world with a specific focus on urban deprivation.
Our project concerns with The National Resource Team for the Urban Homeless (
HAUSLA
) at CES. Hausla works to address the vulnerabilities in health, livelihood, psychosocial traumas, and drug and alcohol addictions that
homeless
men, women and children face.
Hausla?s aim is twofold: to build model interventions for the urban homeless in partnership with the government and to build a knowledge base on homelessness. The team currently runs interventions in Delhi, Patna, Jaipur and Hyderabad and comprises of two main health programs: Recovery Shelter and Street Medicine
Recovery Shelter
Recovery shelter programme began in 2011. The shelters were designed to house homeless patients who require frequent and long-term care. The shelters provide medical care and counselling, as well as beds, food and livelihood programmes all free of charge. The shelters have nurses, medical social workers, counsellors and a doctor who checks in on the patients in the evenings. Patients at the shelters include those with HIV, TB, physical injuries, mentally ill patients and any other long-term conditions. The aim is not only to help patients recover from their health conditions but also, by helping patients access government schemes, open bank accounts, get identification, register to vote as well as providing job training opportunities and counselling; the ambition is to use the shelter as a catalyst to help break the cycle of homelessness.
Recovery Shelter
Street Medicine
Street medicine programme is aimed at providing Spot Diagnosis, First Aid and Free Medication. In addition to these, a range of services is provided under this program such as nursing care, referral and rescue services, and street counselling. The aim is to deal with disease and illness before it got a critical state and to be able to manage chronic illness.
There are multiple Street Medicine teams, each consisting of a nurse, social worker, driver-cum-social worker and a doctor (on-call). The teams go out in the evenings (between 7-11 pm), following a weekly route. The areas visited have been identified as the areas of greatest need. The teams also have slots reserved for ‘follow-ups’ to revisit patients who require further care. The teams see a range of different cases, ranging from minor ailments like coughs, cuts and colds to more severe cases like infected wounds, burns, heart problems, respiratory problems, physical injuries and patients with chronic conditions like TB, HIV, diabetes, mental illness and more.
Street Medicine
Need for Digital System
The team keeps patient records such as demographics, treatment information and history, daily notes, referral/appointment dates, medical reports, photos of patients, photos of wounds and all other patient info on physical registers and individual devices. They are then shared using WhatsApp and uploaded to google drive manually. This method has following disavantages
Labour intensive
Inefficient
Consolidated patient information is not available and not easily accessible to the team while in the field.
no systematic way to keep track of or prioritize appointments, follow-ups or cases.
Hence a need is identified for a digital system that helps the team overcome these challenges and achieve the following key benefits
Record completeness
Regularity of treatment
Saving time and labour for coordination
This will enable better Individual care and Advocacy.
The digital system will be used by approximately 65 users across the 4 cities both in the recovery shelter and street medicine.
Solution
The project started in the month of Dec 2019. Requirements, scope and solution were identified through a series of online discussions.
The project will be done by
Samanvay Foundation
as an implementation of open-source fieldwork platform
Avni
.
TB and MCH are identified as priority areas. However, the programme structure for MCH on field is not completely finalised. And so it was decided to just go ahead with TB for digitalisation for the time being.
Most of the requirements will be met by existing features present in Avni. Following small feature was identified as a gap and decided to be added to the platform through this project

==================================================

“
India lives in its villages. All of us were taught that in school. What we weren?t taught was that much of India does not live very happily.
“
reads a page on the website of JSS highlighting the crisis of rural health.
Jan Swasthya Sahyog (JSS)
is an NGO working in rural Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh for last 20 years. It was established in 2000 by a group of socially conscious health and allied professionals, many of whom underwent training together at the AIIMS, New Delhi. The empowerment of village communities to prevent and treat illness has been central to the work of JSS.
JSS has a
community health programme
running in 72 tribal villages of Bilaspur district covering a population of 36000 people. The villages are located in forests or at the forest-fringe, and many of them lack access to all-weather roads. The programme is structured in 3 tiers. It has the village health workers, all of them women, at the base, sub-centres that support clusters of up to 20 villages at the second tier and a referral centre at the third tier.
The referral centre provides extremely low-cost care to people drawn from more than 2500 villages (approx. population 15 lacs)/towns of Chhattisgarh and M.P and has emerged as a centre for low cost, but good quality comprehensive medical, surgical and obstetric care in the region. At the referral centre, they are already making good use of open-source software by maintaining digital records of all the patients in
Bahmni
. In fact, JSS played a phenomenal role in the initial stages of the creation of Bahmni.
For community programme, all the data is captured on paper in the field and then entered into spreadsheets at the level of hub by a data entry operator. With the increasing amount of work and data, this system is becoming ineffective in helping field workers to track beneficiaries in real time and planning and decision making. People at hub level analyse the collected data to see the progress and this causes delay in decision making.
Thus they envision a comprehensive digital system for their programmes mainly the following
Phulwari
– prevent and address malnutrition among the under 3 years children. Help older siblings go back to school. Providing a stimulating environment for learning and development
Maternal and child care
– Reduce maternal and infant mortality rates by providing quality and comprehensive antenatal care, intrapartum, postpartum mother care, home-based neonatal care in programme villages.
NCDs
– Early diagnosis and prevention of complications of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell, epilepsy in the village community.
Tuberculosis
– Adherence to treatment and prevention of complications.
The digital system will enable :
Change from paper-based data capture to paper-less (Electronic format)
Community-based efficient, quality data capture, analysis and reporting.
Place and person distribution.
Understanding of the disease trends by collecting longitudinal data.
Monitoring and supportive supervision of field staff.
Ease of advocacy for the health rights of the rural and marginalised
The system will be used by a team of 25 users comprising of field supervisors and programme coordinators.
The project started in December 2019. Requirements, scope and solution were identified through a series of online discussions. Some of the Samanvay team members already had an in-depth understanding of JSS work because of Bahmni, so that helped.
The project will be done by?
Samanvay Foundation

Avni
.
Most of the requirements will be met by existing features present in Avni. Following features were identified as gaps and decided to be added to the platform through this project
Enhancement to Attendance feature
The integration between Avni and Bahmni was not identified as an immediate need.
The implementation
went live with Phulwari programme from January 2020.

From CEO’s Desk
Our Vision:
A world with a robust technology ecosystem powering the social sector
Our Mission:
Build and support the ecosystem of software, data, design companies, nonprofit partners, and foundations working towards creating social impact globally
Project Tech4Dev Team – 2025
Looking Back, Moving Forward
As I look back on the past quarter, one word sums it up for me –
growth
. Both professionally and personally, it’s been a meaningful few months. We added 11 new members to the team, taking the team strength to 45, phew! Quite a milestone for a small but fast-growing organisation like ours. Having joined as the first team member back in April 2022, watching Tech4Dev evolve feels a bit like seeing a child grow –  once a baby, now a confident toddler beginning to walk independently:)
There’s a quiet confidence in how our platforms are gaining traction. The trust from our partners, the experience we have built, and the strength of our team are giving us the courage to take bold steps. Highlight for me last quarter has been the new ecosystem partnerships we have formed, each one bringing in fresh perspectives and possibilities.
On the personal front, I had the joy of visiting the US in May to attend my daughter’s graduation, a proud moment, as she’s the first in her generation within the family to earn a degree. And as I write this, she’s just begun her first job, now truly independent, and it’s a huge moment for us as a family. This quarter has also been a reflective one for me. Leading a rapidly evolving team has taught me that emotions at work aren’t a weakness. A close acquaintance reminded me that emotions, when acknowledged and channeled well, can be a strength and that’s the thought I’m carrying with me into the second half of the year, with renewed energy.
Highlights:
Q1 has been full of energy, collaboration, and learning, and it’s heartening to see Tech4Dev’s work gaining momentum across so many fronts.
Building Culture, One Sprint at a Time
One of our favourite moments this quarter was the week-long team sprint in Khopoli, a time to connect, collaborate, and reflect. Akansha from the Glific team built a chatbot specifically for the sprint to keep us all updated on the sprint activities. For the first time, many of us experienced Glific as users ourselves. She captures her experience beautifully in this blog –
Dogfooding Glific
.
The sprint also gave us the space to collectively reflect on our culture. A powerful workshop on workplace biases, facilitated by Team Sama sparked deep conversations and has led to the drafting of a Mutual Respect Charter (expected to be out in July) – a shared guide to how we show up in both physical and virtual spaces.  Our bi-annual Employee Happiness Survey showed that 88% of the team feels supported and appreciated, with collaboration and ownership emerging as key strengths. It also highlighted areas for improvement, like new joinee onboarding, clarity in planning, and work-life balance, which we are actively working to address.
Platform Updates
Glific onboarded 23 new NGOs this quarter, with 17 joining through its flagship
Glific Accelerator program
. This two-day in-person event enabled NGOs to build and launch a working chatbot with hands-on support from the Glific team. Reflections from the accelerator captured by our Biz Dev lead, Sneha Trivedi, in this
blog
.
Dalgo is undergoing a strategic revamp, moving beyond just building pipelines and dashboards to a more consultative approach, helping NGOs holistically understand, track, and monitor their program data. A recent
blog post
shares more on the thinking behind this shift. The platform is going through a major redesign using the AI-powered design tool V0 to make it more intuitive and accessible to users. To increase awareness of the platform, a refreshed pitch deck and an introductory Dalgo video are also in the works.
Avni saw positive outcomes from increased marketing, with 4 new NGOs onboarded and more nearing conversion. The team launched in-person and online knowledge-sharing workshops across cities and networks. These sessions are helping the Avni team build visibility as subject matter experts, deepen NGO relationships, and generate new leads.
The
Sashakt Assessment Platform
(designed in collaboration with Veddis Foundation and Avanti Fellows), has completed development and has been deployed for field testing in mid-July.
Preparations for two major cohort programs took shape this quarter – the third cohort of the Data Catalyst Program brings 13 NGOs together this July. The program this time welcomes new ecosystem partners – 4th Wheel and 10X Impact Labs, joining hands with GoalKeep, Dasra and us in running the program. The second cohort program is a pilot – AI cohort, designed to offer hands-on support to 8 NGOs in building impactful AI solutions while also engaging with important themes such as data security and ethical use. The program kicks off in July. Details of the program are shared
here
.
Fractional CxO Service and Grassroots Initiative
The fractional CxO (fCxO) model continues to gain traction. The fractional tech team model has proven to be effective in driving experimentation and deeper engagement. We have doubled the fractional tech capacity and are considering adding one more person next quarter to further scale and accelerate our work.
The grassroots initiative kicked off in Chennai with four grassroots NGOs. This pilot, run in partnership with Dasra’s Rebuild Fund and People4Good, is helping us understand the specific tech and data challenges that grassroots NGOs face and thereafter propose low-touch solutions and integrate relevant tools into their operations. Some learnings and experiences are documented in this
blog
. Our goal is to expand this program to other parts of Tamil Nadu and more geographies by year-end.
Misses:
While we made good progress across many fronts, we faced a few challenges also:
Recent changes in Meta’s messaging policies have led to increased messaging costs and a significant drop (30–60%) in delivery rates of messages across all partner NGOs on Glific. We are in talks with other chatbot providers to raise this concern with Meta but progress is expected to be slow and uncertain.
Glific sales team fell short of the Glific accelerator target by almost 50%. The team will review the performance to improve conversion in the next cycle.
Dalgo did not onboard any new partners in the quarter, against a goal of three. The team is re-examining its outreach strategies to strengthen engagement.
Avni fell short of its target to reach 50% sustainability this quarter. Fundraising efforts to support the platform’s growth are yet to begin and will require focused attention. Additionally, one of the four co-founders of Avni, who was leading engineering, moved on for financial reasons. This has led to a redistribution of responsibilities among the remaining co-founders, which will impact the momentum seen this quarter. The team will need to assess how best to manage this transition and maintain the momentum.
Fractional CXOs have been very busy this quarter due to high demand and limited bandwidth. While new team members have begun contributing, we anticipate further capacity-building next quarter to better serve partner NGOs. In few partner engagements, we chose to take a harder look at the impact and long-term alignment rather than continue with short-term fixes.
The AI Platform bid adieu to our long time consultant Jerome White who took a research position at the World Bank. Jerome was instrumental in creating our AI roadmap. We also parted ways with our AI lead engineer due to differences in our goals and how to achieve them.
Finalizing the structure of our finance team is taking longer than expected. It’s important to close this soon to bring clarity and stability to the team, ensure smoother day-to-day operations, and strengthen our financial planning and compliance as we continue to grow.
What’s Next…
As we look ahead, we are excited to share that our
Tech4Dev 3.0 strategy
for 2026–2029 is now ready. The strategy is built on six years of working with 200+ NGOs across India and Africa. It focuses on scaling our existing platforms, developing new platforms, deploying fractional tech and product teams, supporting grassroots NGOs and strengthening the ecosystem. Through
Tech4Dev Global
, we plan to expand our mission beyond the Global South by engaging skilled professionals from around the world who are eager to contribute to social impact. We are also partnering with The Agency Fund to drive
AI for human development
, and with Dasra to strengthen tech and data capacity across NGOs, governments, and community-based organizations.
Case Study
Tech4Dev’s AI Platform – Strategy, Status and Roadmap
As the demand for AI capabilities across the platforms we built continued to grow, we recognized the need for a
centralized AI platform
. Rather than duplicating efforts to embed AI separately into each platform, our strategy is to build a unified, modular AI layer that can be integrated across various tools and products in the ecosystem. The AI platform is being developed using learnings from our work with Glific and Dalgo at the AI for Global Development Sprint.
The
platform
is being built as a
plug-and-play integration layer
that leverages open-source components and SDKs, including
OpenAI, LiteLLM, and Langfuse
. This design allows us to expose AI functionality to our internal product teams, offers sector-specific co-pilots, input classification, document handling, response evaluation—all built with responsible AI practices and positions us to eventually extend these tools to the broader NGO ecosystem in a scalable and efficient manner.
Dalgo has already been successfully migrated
to the AI Platform, and Glific will be migrated in the next couple of months.
Example – Leveraging AI at Tech4Dev
Kunji
is an AI-enabled chatbot designed to strengthen governance by making information accessible, inclusive, and actionable for government officials. It addresses key challenges like inefficient information retrieval, language barriers, and lack of real-time support. Kunji offers instant, contextual answers, supports voice-to-text, and allows users to access or upload documents. With role-based access and a dashboard for insights, it helps identify training needs and builds capacity across the system. Co-created and rigorously tested within the government ecosystem, Kunji has served over 1,200 users and answered 4,000+ queries, establishing itself as a powerful tool.

Cohorts – A Catalyst for Ecosystem Building
We believe that open-source, community-driven development is the most effective way to build technology for the social sector. By designing digital public goods (DPGs) in collaboration with NGOs, we’ve created platforms like Glific, Avni, and Dalgo that are adaptable, reusable, and shaped by real-world needs. Cohort-based programs foster trust, shared learning, and collaboration, moving the sector away from siloed solutions toward open, collective impact. In line with this approach, we have focused on creating spaces and nurturing an ecosystem that fosters collaboration, including the AI4GD cohort with the Agency Fund, and our upcoming AI Cohort Program launching in July.
Cohort programs – AI4GD & India cohort
The Agency Fund, in collaboration with OpenAI and the Center for Global Development, launched the
AI for Global Development Accelerator
to support responsible, high-impact AI solutions for underserved communities in sectors like health, education, and agriculture. Eight organizations have been selected to receive funding, technical mentorship, credits, and implementation support. Through tailored sprints, collaborative convenings, and in-person events, the accelerator showcases how generative AI can unlock transformative impact in development with ethical and scalable design.
We are leading an
AI India cohort
, focused on strengthening capacity for NGOs. The cohort provides hands-on support for 7 organizations to design and deploy AI solutions aligned with their program goals along with intensive mentoring support.

==================================================

On September 14th, 2023, our dedicated Project Tech4Dev team had the privilege of participating as a partner in the Oasis Summit held in Bangalore. This exceptional event showcasing the Open Source Alliance for Social Impact and Sustainability (OASIS), served as a vibrant hub for a diverse community comprising NGOs, tech enthusiasts and advocates for social change. The day unfurled with a harmonious blend of profound exchanges, enlightening dialogues and promising prospects. The summit unfolded at the Bangalore International Centre, with the venue itself augmenting the event’s ambience.
Our day commenced with keen attention to a panel discussion featuring luminaries from the industry, setting an inspiring tone for the day ahead. A standout moment at the Oasis Summit was an unscripted panel conversation featuring Donald Lobo, the founder of Project Tech4Dev, Kuldeep Dantewadia, the founder of Reap Benefit and Venkatesh Hariharan, the Public Policy Advisor of FOSS United. Their candid insights, shared openly with the entire audience, provided invaluable perspectives on the industry’s evolving landscape. Numerous other panel discussions happened parallelly at various venues as breakout sessions.
During the event, questions arose regarding the implications of the new Digital Privacy and Data Protection Bill, 2023, on Glific. Questions about the changes needed in the platform as a data processor and data protection considerations that NGOs must navigate was discussed. This emphasized the ongoing need for heightened awareness of legal and compliance matters.
Engaging with a diverse array of team members from NGOs, corporate CSR initiatives and the open-source community provided us with a profound sense of the overarching mission uniting us all. Our focus shifted from individual organizational goals to broader, ecosystem-wide aspirations, underscoring our collective commitment to leveraging technology for social impact.
Noteworthy was our insightful exchange with Urvashi and Lobo from Digital Futures Lab. Our discussion revolved around guiding Myna Mahila in conducting smaller-scale experiments and positioning Tech4Dev as a leader in assisting grantees of the Gates Foundation in the LLM cohort. This exemplified the event’s collaborative ethos, where ideas and strategies flowed freely.
At our pop-up stalls one for Glific and another for Dalgo our team members played pivotal roles in fostering meaningful interactions. Creating a friendly and approachable atmosphere at the stall was a key success factor. It made visitors feel at home and encouraged them to engage in meaningful discussions. Effectively conveying Glific’s perspective to individuals from diverse backgrounds, age groups and life experiences presented a gratifying challenge that our team adeptly handled. Collecting contact details from interested individuals was a proactive step, ensuring follow-ups and potential partnerships.
Several other pop-up stalls showcased various open-source solutions, including Jugalbandi from OpenNyAI (integrated into Glific for GPT Integration), ERPNext products for Donor and Volunteer management, Bahmini from Thoughtworks, Kobo Toolbox, Metabase, Chitralekha by AI4Bharat and PlanetRead. These stalls attracted numerous inquiries, primarily from interested NGOs, open-source enthusiasts and contributors, highlighting the event’s appeal to a diverse audience eager to explore these offerings.
Key Takeaways
In reflecting on our participation at the Oasis Summit, several key insights have emerged. The landscape of No Code/Low Code solutions has clearly matured, providing us with highly usable and customizable tools. Embracing cost-effective and sustainable solutions is paramount, as it significantly reduces the burden of maintenance and technological complexity.
Conversations at the stalls yielded valuable insights. To enhance our presence in future exhibitions, we prioritized the improvement of collateral materials and videos. We recognized the need to prominently showcase our dashboard and data visualization capabilities to effectively demonstrate Glific’s prowess. Additionally, enhancing the product demonstration process for hands-on learning emerged as a critical goal to help prospective users fully grasp Glific’s potential. An important question arose during the event regarding the feasibility of offering a free trial period, possibly spanning 7 or 14 days, to allow interested parties to thoroughly explore Glific’s functionality. This inquiry underscored the significance of accessible trial options in attracting potential users, emphasizing the value of providing a usable version of the product for comprehensive exploration, as opposed to a one-way demonstration.
Building Momentum: What Lies Ahead
??Looking ahead, Oasis holds significant promise and we believe that these potential next steps can greatly enrich the Oasis summit and the community. Suggestions include establishing city-wise cohorts, recurring events and webinars to foster networking. Building a vibrant community is an ongoing effort, where platforms like Discord and other community-building methods could play a pivotal role. Additionally, the consideration of capacity-building workshops, training sessions and skill development programs is on the horizon, aimed at empowering members of the Oasis community.
Moreover, there is the envisioning of creating an open-source software catalog to assist individuals and organizations in discovering the right solutions for their specific needs. Organizing hackathons and competitive events can serve as effective means to attract more talent and drive innovation within the community. Further, exploring the establishment of grant programs or connections with existing ones may provide essential financial support for projects aligned with OASIS’s mission. The proposal of conducting impact assessments to showcase the tangible outcomes of initiatives developed within or in collaboration with Oasis could highlight the alliance’s positive contributions. In addition, diversifying funding sources is a strategic move to reduce dependence on a limited number of financial backers. Lastly, the consideration of establishing feedback loops is vital to facilitate ongoing improvements and responsiveness to community needs, ensuring that Oasis thrives in its mission.
Closing Thoughts
In conclusion, our experience at the Oasis Summit showcased our dedication to bridging the technology gap in NGOs. Our interactions, achievements and reflections exemplify the collaborative spirit of the event and our commitment to leveraging open-source solutions to drive social impact and sustainability. Building connections with existing organizations and many more new ones underscored the event’s significance in fostering meaningful collaborations and partnerships. As one panel discussion aptly highlighted, the optimal solution for an NGO need not always be open source. Rather, the paramount focus should be on selecting products or solutions that cost-effectively address specific needs without necessitating an extensive maintenance team.
In the realm of exploration and experimentation, organizations have been engaging with social development entities and entrepreneurs, immersing themselves in hands-on volunteering and deep dives into the challenges they face. However, amidst these endeavors, they’ve also encountered their fair share of failures. One crucial lesson learned is that technology cannot simply be bestowed; it’s the understanding and capacity-building that take precedence over software.
As NGOs navigate the complexities of pro-bono work, they often grapple with the ever-expanding scope-creep and a multitude of requirements. These organizations face the challenge of articulating their problems effectively, seeking meaningful tech solutions without falling prey to the allure of techno-silver bullets or the “app-first” perspective. Within this intricate landscape, we have come to realize that the heart of success lies in fostering a sense of community and collaboration, echoing the core principles of Free and Open Source Software. At its heart, the essence of FOSS is community and these organizations are living embodiments of that collaborative spirit.Title: Project Tech4Dev’s AI Strategy
Author: Jerome White
Date: July 2024
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates

==================================================

Project Tech4Dev’s AI strategy can broadly be classified into four pillars. The first is systems we build in partnership with NGOs. These systems rely on AI to solve specific challenges the NGOs face. The outcome of this effort drives two of our other pillars: applied AI research initiatives and reusable AI platforms. The fourth pillar consists of AI community leadership. This blog post outlines these pillars in detail.
Production
Our production pillar consists of solutions we build alongside our NGO partners. These are cases that are addressable by AI, if solved can significantly accelerate an NGOs productivity, and are cases that can be generalized either across the sector or across organizations.
An example project comes from the
work we have done
with
STiR
. They needed summarized insights from qualitative interview data taken from teachers with whom they work. These summaries were critical to their internal evaluations, along with reports they produce for external stakeholders. For many of the data needs, they turn to
Dalgo
; prior to our collaboration Dalgo did not have strong support for qualitative data.
We first built a custom web app for them that supported the use case. Using the app, they were able to select subsets of data they wanted summarized. In addition, they were to choose how they wanted the data summarized: “three best practices”, or “five areas of improvement”, for example. The settings were used to craft a prompt, which was then sent to an Open AI GPT model. The response not only satisfied their summarization requirement, but was formatted to fit their reporting style.
When presented with this use case, we immediately saw its broader scope. Many of our Dalgo users have qualitative data that they are either doing nothing with or – as was the case with STiR – using tools and processes outside of Dalgo that are suboptimal. As we now integrate this feature into Dalgo, we also expose its benefits to a wider audience. In addition, we have noted other NGOs who want summaries of their end-user WhatsApp group chats; so the feature is not necessarily unique to Dalgo, but more so a platform we can offer to support a wide variety of work.
Platforms
Our platform pillar consists of solutions we build that benefit the community. Dalgo,
Glific
, and
Avni
are examples of platforms we have already built. They also embody our philosophy around platform building that we will bring to our efforts in AI: solutions that are applicable across organizations, solve fundamental challenges for a wide array of users, and are open source at their core.
Starting from our production pillar allows us to build our platform pillar with confidence. We anticipate that in most cases, by the time a solution reaches the platform stage we will already have developed a good sense for its core components and unique selling points. We will also have established active users. These are solid foundations on which to build.
As previously mentioned, our summarization work with STiR is a great example of this process in action. Another example is our work in providing Glific users with automated question-answering (QA). Many NGOs have document repositories that contain answers to common questions from their WhatsApp users using either voice notes or text. Automatically answering questions using those references is often the only way NGOs can scale their impact. We have observed various solutions being attempted across organizations, with varying levels of success and deployment best-practices. We are building a single platform that supports multi-modal QA that will allow consistency and ease of management across users.
When it comes to NGOs, it is also helpful to remember Project Tech4Dev is also one. From this vantage, it is important to think about the products we build as potential collaborators and platform contributors. We saw a glimpse of this in the summarization example. Another case is in log analysis. The specific use case was that log messages from day-to-day Dalgo operation are important for system understanding, but can be difficult to pinpoint exactly why a process was successful or erroneous. We have addressed this problem using LLMs, and are in the process of exposing the feature to our clients. Glific also produces voluminous logs for each NGO on its platform, which are currently not exposed to the NGO. As we think through the correct abstractions, we anticipate this feature to be elevated to a platform; and in turn to expand our views on product synergy.
Research
Our production pillar is focused on publishing reusable services and tools to our platform pillar. To do so effectively, it must focus on cases that are relatively straightforward wins. Turning existing processes that have either been proven, or easy to see the need, into AI-enabled artifacts. There are a host of problems however that are equally important, but their solution is not as obvious. We think of these cases as requiring deeper thinking and testing to solve, and thus are part of our research pillar.
There are several such cases we are actively working on with our academic collaborators:
The concept of engagement is keeping users active in accomplishing their task; which often comes from keeping them active across communication channels. For example, ensuring health care workers are visiting sites, and are motivated to do so. Engagement is a core challenge for many NGOs who rely on WhatsApp for outreach and monitoring. We are currently working on this with an NGO in the education space. We foresee the lessons we learn, and example products we build, contributing to a broader platform capable of addressing the problem across sectors.
In the QA paradigm mentioned earlier, it is important for answers to be accurate. Maintaining accuracy does not necessarily mean correctly answering questions, it can also be about admitting uncertainty and asking for help. We are working with an NGO in the healthcare space to develop such a pipeline. If successful an abstraction of the solution will be a candidate for a platform.
Community
Building community across the social sector around AI is as important as the tangible interventions produced by the other pillars. The purpose of the community pillar is not only to act as a common ground for NGOs to exchange ideas and support one another, but to be a paradigm for future funding opportunities. We have displayed both of these angles in the past, but formalize them here.
Over the past year we have organized and participated in several events that have brought the community together. We have presented our work and our best practices at events for
Team4Tech
,
Bridgespan
, and others. We have organized the LLM seminars at our own sprints, and at specialized webinars co-hosted with
Agency Fund
. Whenever we host an event, we focus on providing our participants with outcomes that are immediately usable. We also focus on building bridges between organizations to facilitate offline support.
In addition, our communities provide a backbone of our strategy to funders. Existing models rely heavily on direct NGO support; sometimes co-opting a tech partner to assist in delivery. When this model succeeds, it provides a win for a single organization, and a specialized tech artifact for a specific use case. Even when it works, however, it is often money spent on duplicate effort.
Under our community pillar, there is an opportunity to support development activities that not only generalize across sectors, but create platforms on which others can build and maintain.Title: Pune 2018 Unconference Report

==================================================

I recently got the chance to be a part of the first Tech4Dev unconference at Pune from Nov 30-Dec 1. Since I made the switch from corporate to running a non-profit, many a times I?ve felt like a lonely engineer who could not discuss her ?unique? engineering problems with her other friends. I was definitely craving for a network to geek out with and when Lobo mentioned the unconference, I knew I wanted to be there. The event was attended by technologists and engineers from organizations in the development sector. The first best thing about the event was the democratic agenda creation by the attendees. 🙂
The 2 day event was organized chaos with A-grade fodder for the technical mind sprinkled with a good dose of fun, humor and getting to know each other.
Day 1 was dynamic and included a breadth of topics in the form of speaker sessions, demos, panel discussions and group deep dives. Participants delved into issues ranging from using open data for advocacy to improving operational efficiencies using open source tools. My personal favorites were the use of open source GIS tools to create rich data that aid decision making and a very tactical session on data wrangling for non-technical folks. We are already using some tips we learned in this session in our team at Dost 🙂
Day 2 went deeper into topics chosen by the participants. Learn-a-thons and demos went into implementation details and some groups also contributed to open-source projects. I thoroughly enjoyed co-leading a session on data analytics and visualization where we compared tools used in different organizations and discussed some good data and measurement principles to follow.
After being on a super long flight, I was doubtful about my abilities to keep up. But this unconference blew my mind and I couldn?t have asked for anything better! I am very thankful for the honesty and openness in sharing both successes and struggles and the sense of camaraderie I felt. I am energized and happy to have found my tribe 🙂
A big thanks to the organizers, Chintu Gudiya Foundation & Social Alpha for an inspiring event and for taking care of us for 2 days. Special thanks to Arun, Kurund, Arjav and everyone else. I?m elated by the experience and am already waiting for the next unconference 🙂

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/pune-tech4dev-event-recap/
==================================================

I attended the Tech4Dev conference with the aim of understanding recent developments in how the social sector is using open source technology and left having more than fulfilled that objective.
First, the “unconference” format and especially how it helped strike a good balance between clarity of agenda and freedom to modify it as per public interest, which meant strong participation right through to the very end. This also greatly helped break the wall between organizers and participants, as both were suggesting changes and additions to topics being discussed and also readily volunteering to do product demos.
One of the initial sessions by Vineet from Social Alpha helped me figure out what we even mean by “open source” and the different licensing standards associated with it, from most permissive (MIT license) to most restrictive (trade secrets). I even learnt some new terminology along the way, such as copyleft, which mandates that all future distributions and modifications of code should be free from copyright).
I was particularly excited to attend demos, discussions, and hands-on sessions around data analysis and visualizations, and I did not leave disappointed. The three solutions I witnessed (Metabase, Chartio, and Superset) seemed to be really robust alternatives to the proprietary tools I’ve been using so far, particularly Microsoft Power BI. I also learned that tables and lists are still the most demanded form of visualization, partly because they are the most accessible, which to me is an lesson in listening to your audience.
I was initially unsure of attending the second “hackathon” day, expecting that we’d all roll up our sleeves and start coding. But I was glad I did attend, cause I got to know about the thriving community which builds awareness and collaboration around open data projects. Further, I was particularly impressed with Lakeer and the problem statements they had chosen to answer using GIS data, including improving intra-city transport networks by using map data to identify areas not sufficiently served by bus routes. On similar lines, I was heartened to see the Telengana government’s open data portal and all the work being done by Factly and others to make public data more “analyzable” and also understandable to common people.
I came into the Tech4Dev conference not completely convinced that non-profits, especially implementation organizations, should take up and rally the cause of open source software, because I considered the poor and marginalized to be the primary beneficiaries for civil society organizations and not the open source community. I also felt that most open-source solutions required significant investment from the non-profit to work with developers who would then customize an out-of-the-box product to suit the needs of the organization, and the costs associated with these engagements were seldom known up front. While I feel that work still needs to be done on this front, I left Tech4Dev a convert to the open source movement and confident that open source software available today caters to a vast majority of non-profit use cases.

==================================================

The weekend of November 30th and December 1st, 2018 has been one of the most fulfilling weekends for us at Shelter Associates. We got a chance to showcase, learn and discuss our experiences with technologies with a variety of industry veterans and self-starters at the Tech4Dev Conference organized by the Chintu Gudiya Foundation and Social Alpha in Pune. It was quite an enriching experience where we got a deeper look into the functioning of Open Source Technologies, tactical problem solving methodologies adopted by NGOs like ours and a feeling of comfort knowing that we are not alone in the process of trying to solve the most pressing needs of the society using technology.
The first day started with a keynote given by our founder Mrs. Pratima Joshi, where she outlined her journey of 25 years into key learnings that resonate with most NGOs even today. Briefing everyone with Shelter?s success at coming one step closer to improving sanitary conditions of the urban poor, Mrs. Joshi conveyed how automation using data and technology has been an integral part of the day to day workings at Shelter Associates and how they have been able to achieve economies of scale at a low cost because of the same. Later, Mrs. Joshi advocated the need to institutionalise data with the government so that the burden of information does not stay with the NGOs and is passed on to the people who need it the most for years to come.
The keynote set stage for the ?unconference? where people presented technologies ranging from integrated systems for education, health and sanitation to the various visualization techniques to ease decision making processes. The 15 minute presentation format that allowed multiple NGOs to present at the same time facilitated maximum consumption of information within a very limited time period. This coupled with the freedom of movement approach, allowing people to use their feet to move to presentations where they felt they could learn or contribute better, made the whole experience quite exciting and involving. This set the stage for the second day where people would vote on the topics they wanted to deep dive into and learn more about after the first day surface level flirtations. Through this format, we were able to discuss the pros and cons of using one technology over other effectively and the common problems we come to face while using them.
By the end of the second day, the idea of the whole Open Source Community echoed more clearly with all the people present, as we were able to identify the need for creating a symbiotic relationship amongst us. We were not only seeking solutions to the problems we faced, but we were looking out for each other in a much more deeper sense. We were able to understand that making better choices takes work and there is a daily give and take in this open source community but it is worth the effort since we are trying to create something greater than ourselves. We ended the day knowing that our NGO community, is a structure of symbiotic processes working towards the good of every person, process and organisation.

Author: Jerome White
Date: June 2024
Category: Dalgo

==================================================

Quantitative data is a strong focus for many data wrangling platforms. If you have numeric or categorical data, these tools make it easy to derive insights, make reports, and drive decision making that is objective. Qualitative data, while just as informative, hasn?t been so lucky. Until recently has been a lot tougher to work with and subsequently snubbed in many data workflows. The development and accessibility of large language models is changing that narrative, and Dalgo is racing to take advantage.
A perfect example is a feature we?re building to help make sense of qualitative data organized by qualitative features. This blog post presents a recent use case we?ve developed with
STiR Education
that shows what we mean.
Motivation: the STiR use case
STiR Education
supports government education systems to reignite intrinsic motivation, so that every official, teacher, and child is motivated to learn and improve. Transcriptions of these activities produce reams of free form qualitative data. To properly archive the information, there is a rich set of quantitative data that lives alongside it: the event type, when and where it occurred, and the persons involved, for example. Since these aspects also describe other STiR activities, the qualitative data fits right into existing relational schemas. Unfortunately, SQL?s string operations are too rudimentary to make the relationships meaningful.
What STiR wanted was to get a sense for themes and summaries across these qualitative activities, differentiated by one or more of their traits. The sentiment of teacher feedback per location over the last month, for example. To accomplish this, their evaluation team developed a manual process involving ChatGPT. They would first filter teacher conversations based on quantifiable information ? when and where the conversation took place, for example ? then copy only the remarks from that filtering. The remarks would be pasted into a ChatGPT session, along with a short instruction prompt asking the LLM to summarize the data in various ways. In addition to summarization, they requested strict output formatting to ensure the response was directly usable in their regular reporting presentations.
This was the perfect use case for LLMs, since they are really good at natural language processing. This was also a perfect use case for Dalgo, since it?s really good at data. What a time to be alive!
Building the POC
Our first step was to better understand STiR?s manual process ? what qualtitative data they were using, how it was being filtered, and how it related to the quantitative components. Because STiR is a Dalgo user, it was straightforward to turn these lessons into aggregation and transformation pipelines. We had a structured candidate table in a matter of minutes. From this table, we were able to run simple SQL statements that selected qualitative data filtered by quantitative columns.
Our next step was to better understand how the evaluation team used ChatGPT. What insights were they trying to get from the qualitative remarks, how did they express this desire to the LLM, and how satisfied were they with the result. This allowed us not only to replicate their work ? to the extent possible with LLMs ? but also to have a point of comparison as we developed our own prompts.
Those pieces were stitched together using Open AI?s GPT API. Quick and painless for a seasoned engineer.
With a working end-to-end system, we needed a user interface. Ideally, this would live inside Dalgo, but in the spirit of quick iteration we built something using Gradio. Gradio has great support for building chatbot interfaces, handling all the messy Javascript required to make a web application reliable and reactive. We could focus entirely on exposing our prior effort. The following image shows the landing page of our web app:
The interface is divided into two halves. On the left are facets by which users can filter underlying qualitative data. Toward the bottom, there are options that affect prompt generation: ?type of summary? and ?number of points.? The qualitative data in this case was feedback from teachers about the STiR programming they received. To that end, summary types could either be best practices STiR conducted, or areas of improvement. The LLM is asked to summarize remarks into a discrete number of points ? that number is specified with the slider.
The right side is populated after selections are made and ?submit? is clicked. Submission first generates an SQL query, then issues that query to the database tables in Dalgo. The returned qualitative data is inserted into an appropriate prompt, and the package is sent to Open AI. The model’s response is presented to the user in the ?LLM summary? box. There is a copy button in the upper-right corner of that field making it easy to copy-paste results wherever required. The table below the summary is filled with the remarks selected by the SQL statement. While that data is not generated by the LLM, displaying it allows users to validate the generated summary.
Future
STiR has been a great partner to work with on this. They have found the tool useful, and have offered feedback that will make it even better for future organizations.
While Gradio has been great as a prototyping mechanism, getting this functionality natively into Dalgo is the way forward. The Dalgo team is now busy integrating the tools programmatic logic into the platform and thinking through interface designs that fit nicely into the existing user experience.
It?s about time qualitative data was promoted, accessible, and valued. We?re excited for this feature to be a step in that direction.Title: Quest Alliance at the Data Catalyst Program
Author: Abhishek Nair
Date: November 2023
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/quest-alliance-at-the-data-catalyst-program/
==================================================

This blog is written by Shiny Dhar from the Quest Alliance team
The social sector collaborates in many forms. There are collaboratives, capacity-building programs led by funders, agencies, quasi-government or multilateral organizations, and conferences that let the space come together to discuss and look beyond or look back.
The data catalyst program is one such program that the Quest team attended this year at the beautiful Port Muziris at Kochi. The program was a joint effort by Project Tech4Dev in collaboration with Dasra, intending to bring together senior management, data practitioners, and leaders from several of India’s most reputable NGOs for a three-month cohort-based program. It differed significantly from other programs because it adapted a practitioner’s approach to developing scalable and sustainable data solutions via interactive, hands-on, problem statement-based workshops.
The Quest programs have come a long way since 2004. We are at a scale stage where the focus is on scaling our programs by increasing adoption at institutions or working directly with the district education system for our models to be adopted across the district through a cascade system. We have collected a lot of data in time and aim to become a genuinely evidence-based organization with high investments in data infrastructure and culture creation. With these goals in mind, our issues also have complications that often come with scale.
The Data Catalyst program helped us identify, formalize, and streamline solution-building for many of our identified issues. While the results are for another post in the new year, here are my biggest takeaways from the program:
Data culture is top down to bottom up
: Culture often starts at the top, encompassing an org-wide approach of all leaders to
trickle down the use of data
to make decisions. What came out strongly via examples is how we collectively should re-examine data management. We are often underscoring the importance of fostering a robust data culture that encompasses more than just swift data analysis. Building this culture is more complicated than it looks. Goalkeep’s sessions and the data culture rubric gave us more insight into what areas we need to focus on to execute our existing data strategies to fruition. The session on data levers that are essential based on an organization’s strength and areas of development while solving its various problem statements was another key takeaway that we are trying to make decisions internally at Quest.
Metrics
: The alignment of metrics with the organization’s primary journey that focuses on tracking progress comes from our key stakeholders and beneficiaries. These metrics need to be identified and refined over time and discussed often. The Agency Fund discussed an approach to look at funnel metrics during all data-driven discussions and updates. Funnel metrics are widely used in product management but are equally powerful tools for visualizing impact numbers.
Visualizations
: One of the key takeaways related to this is designing dashboards that are combined and separated by stakeholders using the Key Questions theory. A best practice was to put these critical questions on dashboards to help increase utilization by fields, programs, or operations teams. A key question often has a clear purpose and an action associated with it to be truly effective. For example, an operations dashboard could have “How many parents did the field team visit this month ? “provided that visiting is an important metric that leads to outcomes. The action could be chasing 100% by the end of the month for the field team.
Correlation vs. Causation
: As organizations, we could move away from a pre and post-approach that establishes connections alone. For example, while percentage points difference can often be used during baseline and endline to determine impact, the evaluations should statistically move to establish correlations, eventually establishing causation. While correlation can be easy, causations are complicated and more resource-intensive processes. However, if we are systematic in our approach, it is possible to design for the final steps while laying the foundations. While experimentation is critical, keeping research and data teams in the loop for M&E, Project Design, and Impact Evaluations is essential. This enables a systematic approach to experiments and innovations, involving defining metrics, considering counterfactuals, and using appropriate analysis and statistical methods to ensure that the results are significant enough.
One team, many avatars – Automation, Research, ML, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Analysis
: It is essential to understand where we stand in the data journey and the key strengths of the data team members instead of merging and using all these terms interchangeably or assuming that all roles are the same. For organizations with fewer members who are data literate, identifying specialists and vendors in the space is essential. Self-learning AI tools and utilizing them for data analysis is another way to go about it. The GPT 4 version of ChatGPT supports good data analysis that can be utilized for crunching numbers using a simple conversational approach that can be used with very little tech prowess.
Use of AI and LLMs:
LLMs (Large Language Models) refer to large, general-purpose language models that are pre-trained and then can be fine-tuned for specific purposes. Various automation approaches were recognized like Dalgo to streamline the data cycle or ChatGPT for data analysis, which frees up time for more targeted and strategic team tasks. Many projects were discussed in Health and Education, where Glific was used to create chatbots that increased project reach without increasing project costs. Some things to consider while building such approaches are data privacy, ethical challenges, solution-level challenges ( e.g., hallucination), language barriers, expert opinion on problem and solution statements, and force-fitting LLMs to solve issues that can perform better without. Some exciting platforms to explore were – Bard, ChatGPT, and Jugalbandi.
Upskilling and Data
: The emphasis on continuous learning and upskilling at all levels, including managerial and leadership positions, underlining the importance of adaptation in a changing world, came out very strongly in all conversations.
Data Storytelling
: Data is a significant enabler in crafting powerful stories of change for our internal and external stakeholders. The significance of patience in crafting coherent data stories for external stakeholders, recognizing that the process often begins with seemingly independent questions, culminates during the articulation stage, and often re-shapes with extensive feedback loops, highlights the need for learning and unlearning. Data teams must filter These feedback loops into important and irrelevant feedback to maintain the data story’s effectiveness.
The interactions with roommates, over ‘chai,’ at dinner tables, during worktimes, or simply just five minutes in the lobby went beyond mere exchanges. It reflected our collective purpose of making the world a better place and the role that data can play in collective success. Part one ended with a bang with a fantastic karaoke night where everyone came together to share stories, sing songs, and continue exciting conversations in a more informal settinglooking forward to Part 2!Title: READ project  Tech4Dev Update

==================================================

The changing environment of NGO sector where the partners are looking for easily accessible information, we have been struggling to cope with bringing about the necessary upgradation. Tech4dev seemed like the solution for us.
In November 2018, Reading Class Project of the network READ was selected as one of the winners of technological development support of Project Tech4dev an initiative of Chintu Gudiya foundation.
Our mission at READ is ?To encourage and promote reading habits among vulnerable children of age 6 to 14 years, through workshops, exhibitions and trainings with the participation of parents, schools, communities and NGOs so as to develop them as informed, sensitive and responsible members of society?.
READ is currently a network of 5 NGO?s who work on the reading component of the education. Through these NGO?s we are reaching out to 328 schools covering more than 79,000 children from 1 st to 4 th std of Pune , Pimpri Chinchwad Corporation Schools , Zilla Parishad Schools and also few Private school.
We are one of the 8 NGOs who were selected by the Chintu Gudiya foundation after they followed a transparent selection process. We were kept informed about the process at every stage. We applied to Tech4Dev with an intention to develop a tool where we could collect and collate various data related to children, books, schools etc. We wanted to generate reports for our partners wherein they could see the positive changes happening in schools with their support. We also wish to showcase the progress made by the children to the Education Department. It would also help us to show the needs that need to be addressed.
We also have a collection of more than 4,29,000 story books which need to be categorized as per the level of the child who will be ultimately reading it. This software when developed would also act as a storehouse of some excellent training material developed by our member NGO?s over a period of 20 years and more.
Tech4dev has assigned this work to Soft Corner to understand our technical needs. They will work with us for a period of 5 to 6 months in helping us build this reporting tool so that we can share our work with the Education board, civil society and media. This will help us strengthen the existing system with evidence based data. This can also be an open source available to NGOs and public to be used across the education sector.
We began this journey with Soft Corner team by orienting them on the nature of the Reading Class Project. Their team also visited 2 schools, where they observed the actual sessions conducted, the records maintained by the field staff. To help them understand our current process we shared some reports. All of this was done through various meetings held in December and January, luckily for us Soft Corner is based in the same city as we, which definitely makes the process easier.
The team is not only helping us by developing the tool but they are also suggesting various options regarding smooth data entry methods like providing tab to field staff, using QR code etc. Till now we have seen a small snapshot of the mobile app screens. As I understand, the development work has begun.
We all are excited to use the end product and showcase the good work done by all the NGOs!!

network has received the support for technological development through Project Tech4dev. Soft Corner the software solution provider has been working very closely with us since then.
We appreciate all the efforts put in by the Soft Corner team along with Madhuri and Eshan to give us the best possible solution. They have really tried to understand the grass root level problems and have made all possible efforts to address all the issues and concerns raised by us.
A small demo was given to the core members of the network in mid-April. Based on the inputs given by us the Soft Corner team made modifications and came back to us in the 1
st
week of May. Another demo was organized with more members this time. Further suggestions and inclusions were given which were also worked on. They showed us all the formats needed for data entry as this was a big concern for all NGO?s. There is a huge amount of data which will have to be entered and we wish to start doing it at the earliest.
Finally on 8
th
of May, 2019, 28 people from 7 NGO?s came together to get a hands on training of the developed software.
All efforts were made by the team to make sure that the tool was understood by the people present for the training. We were also shown a glimpse of the application which will be used by our field workers. The tool is easy to use and we are sure that our objective of reducing manual errors, getting data from field real fast, making it easier for our staff to keep records and a stronger MIS which can be used to showcase the work done by all NGO?s will be achieved.
We also got a separate temporary link to bulk upload our data and create the bar codes for all our books, so that we could create this data while the final system was being made production ready.
The system has now been put in production mode on the cloud server of Soft Corner till we have our own cloud server in place. Once we do that, we will be moving the system to our server.
We really are eager to put this to use soon.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: November 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/rapid-deployment-with-gigalixir/
==================================================

Talking with NGOs and understanding the processes they are using to communicate with their beneficiaries and the challenges they were facing, we were set on a path to create an application that would empower non-profits communication with their beneficiaries. After spending months and working on design and implementations we were ready for deployment of Glific.
Before deep dive into the processes and platforms we used to deploy, here is some insight into the product that we need to deploy.
Glific is a two-way-communication tool that runs on the Whatsapp platform. It is written in two parts with the front-end being written in React and the back-end is written in Elixir Phoenix. It heavily uses Elixir Phoenix features like distributed clustering, hot upgrades, Genserver
Our Journey of Deployment:
1. Initial approach with Docker-based manual deployment on AWS
Starting with a single NGO onboarded, we tried to keep the overall cost at minimal as the cost can be a deciding factor. So when an NGO required infrastructure for hosting Glific for them. We decided to release new changes on a monthly basis and opted for a low configuration server infrastructure setup. After spending some time researching for a platform, we went with the AWS manual build process.
But as the NGO started using the application, deploying updates and quick fixes became crucial. Thus the initial plan for releasing new changes every month quickly went out of the window. With Build cycles becoming frequent, we were facing hiccups with a low configuration server infrastructure as each build would take hours to complete.
2.Our next approach with Continuous Deployment with AWS ECS
Next, we moved to AWS ECS with automated deployment. With AWS ECS the majority of our problems were solved and the automated deployment reduces the overhead of deployment of frequent updates and fixes.
But as the ECS is a serverless deployment, we were not able to access the server and fully utilize the many advantages which Phoenix provides.
Know more about AWS ECS deployment here:
https://chintugudiya.org/focus-areas/tech-work/overview-deploying-glific-on-aws-ecs-fargate-with-cd-in-place/https://coloredcow.com/overview-deploying-glific-on-aws-ecs-fargate
Implementing Multi-tenancy
As there was no multi-tenancy, so any new NGO that gets onboarded, needed a separate infrastructure setup for each of them bringing up the overall cost and separate build for each organization would make deploying frequent updates impossible.
So, we started implementing the multi-tenancy in Glific. But updating the app for multi-tenancy would require changes at the elemental level of an application, which would take time for implementation and testing. So we were left with two choices to either wait for multi-tenancy implementation or upgrade to a better server configuration infrastructure.
Thus we were again researching for a platform that supports our need and as well as is compatible with the elixir. Thats where we came across Gigalixir which is a fully-featured, production-stable platform-as-a-service that supports Elixir Phoenix features which were helpful for a multi-tenancy environment of Glific.
Deployment on Gigalixir:
Gigalixir was originally built for Elixir but any language with a build pack can run in Gigalixir. It even supports hot upgrades that let us deploy new code with zero downtime keeping NGOs in constant contact with their beneficiaries and at the same time updating the application for NGOs with the latest features.
It also provides some outstanding features for elixir deployment like the observer, remote access to the server, IEX terminal, updating configurations from the dashboard, and running migrations which makes it ideal for deploying elixir applications.
Initially, we did face some hiccups with deploying our app in Gigalixir like Cross-origin issues and establishing a WebSocket connection but with the rich customer support that Gigalixir provides and the build packs, it offers we finally realize that it is because of some wrong configurations in the release file.
It took some time but we were able to resolve this issue. Apart from that deployment on Gigalixir is pretty straightforward. You can have a look at the deployment
steps here.
In case you are also stuck with some issue here is our sample release file we used for the deployment.Title: Reap Benefit: Glific + Google Sheets makes a great chatbot to help Covid affected families
Author: Kurund Jalmi

==================================================

Our friends at Reap Benefit recently deployed a Covid related chatbot to help multiple NGOs use their volunteer base to link Covid families who are looking for help to resources and hospitals that could potentially be a good match for their needs. We’ll describe in detail some of the aspects of the system, but the below video should give you a good idea of the overall goals and how the system handles different use cases
Initial version of Covid Chatbot showing how the pieces are linked together
The various components that make the system useful are
WhatsApp Client for the citizen to interact with the system. Citizens can find information on their Covid test, hospital beds and other relevant information. This information can be dynamic and tailored as time evolves
Glific to structure the flows and interact with the citizen. Flows are mainly used to collect relevant data from the citizen, and give back reports to the citizen based on their SRF ID (the ID used by govt apps and testing centers)
For administrators and volunteers, Glific can expose another set of flows via Glific’s collection and permissioning system to give them enhanced access and detailed reports.
The system can ask the citizen for the location of the patient, with geocoding, we can get the city and ward for that citizen. Volunteers can be assigned to handle all requests for a specific ward.
Volunteers enter and edit information via Google Sheets for the citizens they are responsible for. Based on the phone calls and other information they collect externally they can update the Google Sheet. Depending on the NGO process, volunteers can also call the citizen up to get updated and/or more detailed information.
The updated information can then be sent back to the citizen when they request it again and/or via a nudge message.
We can also add an analysis layer to the information collected to give us a better estimate of how many requests were handled and updated by volunteers, the frequency and distribution of when and where requests are coming from. Based on this, the NGO can tweak the forms to collect more specific data and/or focus on the most pressing problems
As the system increases in scope, we can use Google Sheets to collect the information, and then merge it into a database for efficient processing and distribution. The main goal would be to keep things simple along with the ability to handle multiple formats in a seamless manner.
Super cool and motivating to see how Glific can be used so effectively and serve as a vital communication piece of the this multi-layered problem. This has also given us a few good idea on ways we can add functionality to Glific to make things easier for external integrations.
Please do get in touch with us or the folks @ Reap Benefit if you would like to deploy something along similar lines for your organization. Together we can help make a difference and chip in our small contributions

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/recap-of-tech4dev-project-conference-april-2019/
==================================================

On April 15 and 16, we had our first
Project Tech4Dev
conference in Bangalore. Thanks to Vineet and Srikanth from our ecosystem partner,
Social Alpha
for hosting us and doing the planning and logistics. This gathering included our
6 software partners
. In addition, our ecosystem partners Social Alpha and
Lumen Consulting
also joined us for this event. All in all, we had a total of 18 people at the event.
Detailed minutes for the event are on
our shared drive
I’ll summarize and highlight some of my thoughts and observations and things that I’m excited about.
Overall, I think it was great to see the group together and how most of us had similar thoughts and ideas on how we should interact with NGOs and how we can enable them to do their work more effectively. We had some fairly hard discussions on a few different topics. They included a discussion on our mission and vision, how we can straddle the line between pro-bono services offered by the foundation and paid services by the partners for continued support and development, the right time and place of making a project open source, and our focus on reusability and building on existing open source ecosystems.
Sucheta Bhat chatting with the group
I also enjoyed our two guest talks from prominent NGO leaders. Kalyani from
Naz foundation
spoke about their journey as an organization and the work that they do in the field. She also spoke a bit about their experience with using technology platforms and what works and what does not work as they scale. Sucheta Bhat from
Dream a Dream
started her chat with an interesting question to the group and asked them to describe their work on technology in relation to non-profits as a metaphor. It was surprising to see how people struggled to answer the question and they had to get their creative side of the brain re-engaged. She encouraged us to look at the NGO world with a different lens to truly understand their problem and what they are trying to do. Overall, all of us believe, that for our work to really make an impact, we need to work with the NGOs as true partners over an extended period of time.
Another good discussion was focussed on improving our application process and a clean separation between the partners and the NGOs during this process. Vivek from Samanvay foundation proposed a fairly solid plan and lines of responsibilities between the NGOs, software partners and tech4dev. This avoids the potential conflict of interest between the partners and the NGO and at the same time puts more responsibility on the NGO allowing them to drive the process. We will also encourage NGOs to apply for innovation grants and expand the scope of the program.
Finally, I do think we found an excellent group of software and ecosystem partners. It was really good to meet and interact with them over the course of the two days, which seemed too short a time. As a collaborative, the amount of impact we can make on the sector and with the NGOs is huge and I’m looking forward to a great year.Title: Redesigning a city-level data platform
Author: Kurund Jalmi

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/redesigning-a-city-level-data-platform/
==================================================

In the age of urbanisation that?s seeing cities grow at a fast pace. Meaning larger, more diverse problems in urban planning. In such challenging times, an open data platform that captures and gives access to quality city data would help drive better citizen-led governance and arrive at collaborative ways to address the rising urban challenges.
We have partnered with Oorvani Foundation, which works on open knowledge platforms, that help catalyse better cities.
Their vision is to:
Better cities with the informed, engaged and active citizenry.
And their mission is to: Build open knowledge platforms for civic media, open data, and citizen engagement.
Their initiatives include:
Citizen Matters
– an independent news media focused on cities and citizens, with professional journalists and citizen reporters offering insights and solutions to India?s urban issues.
Co Media Lab
– a community media lab to support civic engagement and collaborations.
What is OpenCity?
OpenCity.in
is a data portal focussed on city-level data and its usage. It was developed in collaboration between the
Oorvani Foundation
and
DataMeet
, a community of Data Science and Open Data enthusiasts.
The platform helps citizens and civil society by bringing visibility and transparency into local governance and enabling data-driven decision making.
Why do this?
Currently, there are 534 Datasets and 1323 Documents hosted on the platform and it is continuously growing to cover more information and data from cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, etc.. On average, over 60K users use the platform every month.
With a vision to make this already widely used platform more accessible and increase advocacy, OpenCity.in, Tech4dev and CivicDataLab banded together in February.
We plan to create an easily scalable platform with more city level pages detailing high-level statistics and analytics to drive more research from the platform. With a few well-placed design research workshops and working sessions with data and civic collaborators, we hope to improve public participation and contribution to the platform.?
How we plan to do this:
Design and Background research
We plan to study the existing OpenCity portal and other City portals to see how they are designed to benefit civic engagements. We would study user journeys, possible pain points/drop offs and other site level patterns. User Research would be done to understand the reasons behind some of these problems while also helping us better gauge emerging user needs and opportunities for OpenCity.
Setup Base for CKAN and analyze CKANext universe
We plan to study existing open data platforms and CKANext universe for city-level data publishing and find features, extensions and plugins that can be replicated for OpenCity. Also, develop a comprehensive meta-data form to ensure metadata is collected from the OpenCity team which would make usage of data and datasets easy but also replicable and scalable.
Design and develop the user interface for CKAN based on user requirements
We plan to conduct user workflow testing of low fidelity designs to understand user journeys and experience. Use the learnings to create high fidelity designs complete with palette, iconography, typography and other visual components. Finally, build skin and interactions for OpenCity.
Develop to Integrate Data Visualizations?
We plan to research the prominent category of datasets available on OpenCity and integrate appropriate visualizations on the platform using D3.js, NVD3.js, Leaflet, Mapbox and Apache Superset
Migrate to CKAN
Write scripts to migrate data and documents from WordPress pages to CKAN to build a robust search which enables faster searchability and discoverability of data. Better maintenance and structure of data making it more scalable.?
Build City Explorer Pages for 5 Cities and Handover to Team Open City
Design and develop and thoroughly test City Explorer pages for select 5 Cities so that it?s scalable to other cities in the future. Set up Google Search Console for publishing timely sitemaps, Google Analytics and Matomo(for usage heatmaps and more features) for collecting user behaviour on the platform and create timely usage reports.
Conduct a 2-day workshop for the OpenCity team to get them on board to the new ecosystem and do a handover for further development cycles.
Tech Stack
Primary Data Platform: CKAN
Language: Python
User Interface: WordPress
Peeking into the future
We can process and search for Non-machine-readable formats (like images, pdf etc.)
Develop other City level dashboards to enable exploration and analysis between various cities
Integrate a data collection app to OpenCIty to enable the collection of primary data.
Use linguistics and Natural Language Programming methodologies to increase the access to resources by translating to Indian vernacular languages.
Working to create impact through data
City Planning
– More mindful and holistic approach to building transportation routes, based traffic and citizen feedback and needs
Citizen-led change
– Better data-driven decisions to run campaigns to rectify potholes, environmental campaigns
Times of COVID-19
– More awareness of city-level local campaigns
– Activation of neighbourhood resources to help the affected, in times where immediate action is critical.

Author: ericamiglani
Date: December 2024
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/reflecting-on-2024-a-year-of-growth-and-gratitude/
==================================================

2024 in Review
As we close the year, I find myself reflecting not just on the milestones we have achieved at Project Tech4Dev, but on the heart and soul of the organization—our people, our culture, and the shared values that guide our work every day. This year has been one of growth, transformation and learning, and I am filled with immense pride and gratitude for all that we have accomplished together as a team.
Key Milestones and Achievements
This year felt like a big step ahead in building the tech ecosystem we envision for the social sector.
One of the standout moments of the year was the
Glific
Accelerator, where we brought 25 NGOs on board in just two days. The success of this initiative has led us to make it an annual program 2025 onwards!
Dalgo’s
10-hour Proof of Concepts (POCs) was another good experiment tested in the year. This initiative allowed NGOs to experience the potential of the platform firsthand by working closely with the Dalgo team, enabling them to make more informed decisions before signing up.
Avni
piloted a self-service model aimed at reducing onboarding costs for NGOs with limited budgets. By trying to address the affordability barrier, Avni is aiming to open the platform to more organizations, encouraging inclusivity and accessibility.
Our
Fractional CxO (fCxO) advisory program
launched an internal tech support team to accelerate NGO project implementation. This allowed proposed suggestions from the fCxO to be put into action without delay, while NGOs simultaneously worked on building their own tech capacity with the fCxO’s support. The pilot successfully resolved previous delays in executing these suggestions, which were caused by limited capability and capacity within NGO teams. Building on this success, we are now investing in building a fractional tech team in-house to provide ongoing support for fCxO engagements.
I feel happy with the data-driven approach behind these pilots, each of which emerged from the challenges we observed on the ground.
Another key milestone was the
Data Catalyst Program
, run in partnership with Dasra and Goalkeep. This year, we piloted a new, more engaging format by awarding a sum of money to the most promising data pitch from the participating twelve NGOs to enable them to implement their idea. This initiative not only enabled innovation but also added excitement and competition. The results from this program have encouraged us to make it a regular feature every year. We are now exploring ways to scale it further, bringing in more NGOs while ensuring each one receives the same level of attention and mentorship.
This year, we launched the
Chai Pe Charcha
initiative to connect with local NGOs near our quarterly sprint locations. The idea was simple: while our team works together in various locations for a week, can we also foster community, promote peer learning, and understand the tech challenges faced by nearby NGOs? We also aimed to raise awareness of the tech ecosystem available to them, including the opportunity for some to receive pro-bono tech and data advisory from our fCxOs. We’re excited about the learning environment we’ve cultivated in the past two sprints and plan to continue this initiative in 2025.
The
Tech4Impact CTO Convergence
event, held for the first time at the beginning of the year, brought together tech leaders across nonprofits with the aim to create a supportive network for CTOs of NGOs. We wish to continue it annually, with the hope that in the future, the community will take ownership and lead the initiative.
Culture and Values—The Heart of Tech4Dev
One of the most meaningful milestones this year was the collective effort we put into defining our organizational values and culture. Through a deeply introspective process, team co-created six core values that define who we are:
Social Impact Focus, Trust, Collaboration, Excellence, Openness and Innovation
. These values are not just words but principles we live by every day, shaping how we interact with each other and our partners.
Continuing this path of growth, we underwent a re-branding exercise this year. We launched a fresh new logo and a redesigned website that better reflects the essence of our work and the impact we strive to create. The new look captures the energy, innovation, and focus on community that lie at the core of Project Tech4Dev.
This year, we also introduced several employee-friendly policies aimed at fostering a healthier work environment. From no-call days that promote focused working hours for the team to dedicated learning and development budgets and home-office setups, we prioritized creating an environment where our team thrives. Our employee engagement survey reaffirmed this – scoring 3.19 out of 4 in overall employee satisfaction, with 3.39 out of 4 reflecting the autonomy our employees feel in making decisions. 97% of our team reported feeling valued, which is a testament to the culture we have built together.
Our Growing Team
and Community
This year, we welcomed 10 new members to the Tech4Dev family taking us to a solid 35-member team. In addition, nine team members celebrated their work anniversaries, while two marked their second year with us. Seeing this level of retention and growth fills me with immense gratitude.
Beyond our internal team, the Tech4Dev ecosystem has also grown and we are now a community of more than 250 NGOs and partners – something that will continue to inspire and drive us forward
As our platforms scale we have begun collaborating with partners such as 10x Impact Labs, SocialBytes, Dhwani RIS to extend our reach and support to NGOs
Strengthening Governance and Leadership
A key highlight this year was the strengthening of our executive board. We are delighted to welcome Ntefeleng Nene and Rikin Gandhi to our board, joining the incredible Temina and Shilpa. Their collective wisdom and experience continue to shape our strategy and provide invaluable guidance. I am deeply grateful for their belief in our work and their constant push to challenge us and refine our approach.
Equally instrumental has been our advisory board—Sanjeev, Arun, Kurund, and Nidhi. Their support and perspectives have been invaluable. This group of mentors is always just a call away, ready to offer guidance and support, and I consider myself fortunate to have them by our side.
I would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our funders, both existing and new. This year, we were fortunate to welcome Fidelity Foundation, Azim Premji Foundation, Agency Fund, Cisco and a few others to our family of funders. Their belief in our mission and investment in our work has been pivotal in scaling our platforms and driving impact.
Challenges and Focus for 2025
While this year has been rewarding, it hasn’t been without its challenges. One of the areas we continue to refine is the onboarding process for new NGOs onto our platforms. Another critical focus will be hiring good talent, especially as we expand our AI and business development teams in India and Africa.
Looking ahead, I am particularly excited about three initiatives:
Grassroots Initiative
– Developing light-touch tech solutions for grassroots NGOs to improve program efficiency and effectiveness.
AI/LLM Platform(Mithril.ai)
– Our under-development AI platform will explore how AI/LLM can transform NGO operations.
Africa Expansion
– We are ready to deepen our footprint in Africa, building on the foundation we laid this year
Welcoming 2025!
As we embark on this new year, we do so with fresh zeal and a clear direction. The foundation we have laid in 2024 will serve as a good ground for greater impact in 2025, and I am excited to see us continue to evolve and grow.
To our team, funders, partners, and the broader ecosystem – thank you for walking this journey with us. Here’s to a year of innovation, collaboration, and transformative change.
Wishing you all a joyful and prosperous 2025!Title: Reflecting on Dasra Philanthropy Week, 2023

==================================================

My time with the Project Tech4Dev team at
Dasra Philanthropy Week
(DPW), 2023 was a mix of new and old. The event gave me the opportunity to connect and reconnect with peers who have been doing great work, and left me with so much to explore in the following days. Im using this blog as a way to consolidate my takeaways from the experience.
The venue for the event was Godrej One, a throwback to my days in the Teach for India Fellowship, when wed make occasional trips to this office for larger meetings/events with the staff. It was odd to be entering the building 5 years later, not having to worry about my lesson plans for the next day at school.
For me DPW started with an interesting chat with Lobo and the folks from
Indus Action
(IA). We exchanged thoughts on what impact looks like for different types of NGOs, the role that NGOs play in social impact at scale, adopting tech that meets your needs, and how data is playing an increasingly important role in the sector. We also discussed annual team meets and how Indus Action creates spaces for their team members to connect with the communities they serve. I suspect we will soon see blog posts about Tech4Devs own experiences with community engagement.
Later that morning Erica and Vinod led a workshop on Leveraging Technology with the
Rebuild India Community
. We explored what tech means to the cohort and how they can leverage existing solutions and the support of the nonprofit/tech community to help them along their tech journey.
Erica Arya, India Head, Project Tech4Dev opening with the question What comes to mind when you think of using tech?
The
Rebuild India Fund
is a super interesting initiative, providing flexible long-term funding to non profits which are led/founded by members of the communities that they serve. A great way to encourage and nurture impact through leaders who have the commitment and competence to understand and address systemic problems in their communities.
Through the day, ecosystem partners held short sessions in which they spoke about their work and explored collaboration with the community;
Dhwani
,
Pravah India
,
Manah Wellness
,
Atma
,
GuideStar
,
Arthan
,
India Development Review
. Some familiar and some new to me.
I particularly enjoyed the talk by Ashwin Naik from Manah Wellness, who started with a very simple question Do you have stress? and almost therapeutically guided us through their work, ending by passing around neat little cards which had a barcode linking to an emotional wellness questionnaire. Manah offers free mental health support to nonprofits, and has a program around developing champions or proponents for mental health within organisations. I think this is a much needed service in the social impact space.
Over the two days, I reconnected with friends from
Atma
,
Antarang
, and
Teach for India
, which made me feel like part of the larger community. I also chatted with some new people about their work at orgs like
DEHAT
,
Sristi
,
UTMT Society
, and
Maitrayana
, amongst others, and discussed their relationship with tech and data. Each conversation around tech and data was surprisingly different, with each org at a different stage in their tech and program development journey.
Project Tech4Devs time at DPW culminated (in my opinion) with a great panel discussion on Leveraging Technology for Development where we had a full house of nonprofits moving from one table to another, engaging in 10 minute introductory discussions around the themes of Collaboration, Platforms, Data, and Community. Each table had a member from ProjectTech4Dev and an ecosystem partner,
Goalkeep
,
SNEHA
, and
The Apprentice Project
.
The energy in the room was great, I loved that everytime Arun rang the bell to signal that it was time to switch to another table, it took a good 2-3 minutes to get people to actually move because they were engaged in discussion. It was also good to see people moving in general, as most of us had spent all day sitting in one place or another.
I perceive all those discussions that were cut short as an indication of the value in building this community and having more conversations like this.
Arun and Erica closing the panel discussion by welcoming more discussions in the days to come.
Spending time with the team is becoming something I value more every time it happens; Whether it’s learning about their home lives during a team dinner, getting an education on open source tech development on the cab-ride back home, or watching arguments over the
best filter coffee joints
break out every 5 minutes.
Im also steadily developing a sixth sense for incoming Tech4Dev team banter and am looking forward to testing it out the next time I meet the team.
All in all DPW has been a great opportunity for me to look at things more holistically, beyond the Glific lens of things. In my 4 months here I have received so much valuable exposure to the tech and social impact space. If this space interests you then get in touch with us, 12/10 recommend it. You can thank me later, with filter coffee.Title: Reflecting on Dasra Philanthropy Week: From Finance Frameworks to Gamified Tech Journeys

==================================================

Philanthropy Week this year was nothing short of a 2-day whirlwind with an action-packed first day and a bit more relaxing second — packed with insightful conversations, thought-provoking debates, and a whole lot of energy. I had the pleasure of participating in two very different but equally engaging sessions, each leaving me with fresh perspectives and renewed enthusiasm.
CFO Workshop: Talking Finance with Antony
First up was the CFO workshop, where I joined
Antony
from Tech4Dev on a panel that dove deep into the nuances of finance and tech. Let’s be honest, an afternoon session right after lunch isn’t usually an engaging one . But thanks to Antony’s well-prepped
slides
, sharp insights and the collaborative energy in the room, it was anything but boring.
He brought a couple of unconventional tools to the table—the infamous 3×3 Matrix and the Three-Layer Cake. Think of it as a finance framework dessert that’s as layered and complex as your NGO’s financial management needs. The matrix helped unpack strategic decision-making, aligning finance goals with organizational priorities. It posed the big questions: Are our financial systems aligned with our impact goals? Are they efficient? Are they scalable? Is the org aligned ?
And the cake? Well, it was a delicious metaphor for balancing visibility, capability, and functionality in finance systems. Each layer brought a different perspective, from operational transparency to effective data management. NGOs often struggle with fragmented financial systems, so breaking it down into layers made it far easier to visualize actionable improvements.
What stood out was the appetite in the room for peer learning. The finance leads, representing organizations of various sizes and missions, had an immense wealth of experience. Conversations shifted from theory to real-world application quickly. From navigating compliance complexities to managing funds and where technology could help enable, the room was buzzing with energy and practical insights.
A big thanks to Antony for all the prep work that went into making this session impactful. His thoughtful framing ensured we tackled the challenges head-on. It’s rare to see finance sessions receive this much praise, and I’m glad we jumped in when
Ninad
@Dasra and
Viji
@Educate Girls asked us.
Charting Your NGO’s Tech Journey: Gamification Galore
Next up, we swapped the panelist chairs for a gamified session host hat in a session titled
“Charting Your NGO’s Tech Journey: A Hands-On Gamified Session.”
This was no ordinary workshop—it was an immersive experience that had participants navigating real-world tech dilemmas through a gamified lens. When I started out thinking about the session, all I had clarity was that we didn’t want to do another “
gyaan
” panel session – the session was an experiment to get people talking in the room and help enable those interactions.
With Erica, Lobo and Abhishek from Tech4Dev joining me and Antony, we played out a simulated environment
(Try it our here!)
where NGO leaders faced tough decisions around in-house tech builds, platform integrations, and vendor management. Participants had to weigh the risks and benefits of each choice, considering budget constraints, compliance requirements, and the ever-elusive alignment with mission goals.
The gamified format turned these typically dry conversations into a dynamic problem-solving exercise. One moment, participants were grappling with a fictional tech partner gone missing, and the next, they were negotiating trade-offs between custom development and off-the-shelf platforms. It was fascinating to watch how different teams approached the same scenarios—similar scenarios but different approaches and directions – no right answers but albeit just understanding the compromises we all have to make in making these decisions and what they imply for the future.
Some of the most animated discussions revolved around tech capacity building. Do you upskill your internal teams or rely on external partners? Can you balance flexibility with the security of proven platforms? It was clear that these were not just hypothetical questions; they mirrored the real challenges these leaders face every day.
A huge shout-out to Anto and
Abhishek
for the hours spent ideating and strategizing the session. From the
case design
to the rapid-fire challenges, their creativity was the driving force behind making this work. Running a gamified session was a gamble, but seeing participants leave with not answers but better questions was incredibly rewarding.
Looking Ahead
Reflecting on both sessions, one thing is clear—whether it’s finance or technology, the power of shared experiences is undeniable. These conversations didn’t just offer solutions; they sparked new questions, built connections, and strengthened the collective resolve of the social impact sector.
It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day operational grind. But events like Philanthropy Week remind us of the importance of pausing, learning from peers, and challenging our assumptions. Whether it’s questioning traditional structures/processes or experimenting with playful learning methods, there’s a lot to gain from stepping outside our comfort zones.
Here’s to more experiments, more discussions, and more community collaboration!Title: Reflections from My US Trip: Learning, Connections, and New Perspectives

==================================================

This September, I went on a two-week trip to the US, filled with excitement and anticipation. I was heading to two big events: a funder dinner in San Francisco (SF) and the Dasra Philanthropy Forum in New York (NY). Both were firsts for me, so naturally, I had a lot running through my mind—
What would it be like? Who would I meet? How would things turn out?
It was a mix of anticipation and curiosity, which made it all the more interesting.
The Funder Dinner in San Francisco: New Beginnings:
My first stop was SF for the funder dinner where four NGOs leaders — Vanessa from
SNEHA Mumbai
, Sucheta from
Dream-A-Dream
, Supriya from
Rebuild India Fund
, and myself from
Project Tech4Dev
—were presenting our work to a room full of funders, friends, and well-wishers. The prep for the event started over a month before, and I was amazed at the level of detail that went into it during our weekly connects: the venue, the timing of presentations, how the meal courses would line up with the talks, the invite designs, and of course, getting those all-important RSVPs. Huge shoutout to the Dasra team for pulling it all together!
As the event got closer, my excitement grew, but also some nervousness crept in. Thankfully, the night before the big day, our hosts, Lobo and Marie, invited the NGO leaders and a few neighbors (who also happened to be funders) over for dinner. That casual get-together was the perfect icebreaker, the warmth of their hospitality was a big takeaway for me which made everything else look and feel so comfortable.
Impact in Five Minutes:
Finally, the evening of the event arrived. We welcomed our guests, and soon, the room was buzzing with conversations. It was a full house, and I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for everyone who had chosen to spend their Saturday evening with us. People were reconnecting with old friends, forming new connections, and sharing, in the excitement of the evening.
The format of the event was brilliant: four five-minute NGO pitches, each followed by a short Q&A. This format was just enough to spark curiosity without overwhelming the audience. It was amazing to see the level of engagement, especially given that many attendees lived far from India but were still deeply connected to the cause. I was personally moved and shaken by the powerful stories shared by Hechin Haokip from the Center for Women and Girls and Manohari Doss from the Institute of Self Management – both NGOs supported by the Rebuild India Fund. Some guests were new to the social impact sector, and I could see this event opening doors for them to become champions of these causes in times to come.
The atmosphere in the room felt right—structured but not rigid, formal yet relaxed. The intimate gathering of about 65 people struck a balance that allowed for meaningful discussions while ensuring everyone had space to connect. As the event progressed, the room was filled with energy, and I walked away feeling that the evening was a big success. Hope everyone found a few others they connected to continue the conversations. I know I found two whom I will be following up with:)
The event’s format was so interesting, and I really hope we do more gatherings like this in the future—it felt meaningful and impactful.
New York and the UNGA: An Overwhelming First Glimpse:
After SF, I flew to New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) week, which was a bit overwhelming as a first-timer. I had heard a lot about it —how people hustle to get into side events and register for them ahead of time. It’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re new to the scene.
One event that I managed to attend was a panel discussion hosted by IDInsight on “Making Respect Real in Development.” The discussion was powerful, with leaders like Anshu Gupta of Goonj, Rakesh Rajani of JustSystems, and Cate Oswald of Partners in Health sharing their thoughts. They talked about how disrespecting someone’s dignity can deeply impact their well-being, but when you get it right, it can unlock incredible potential. It was a thought-provoking conversation that left me reflecting on how we can all make a difference, no matter how small our circle of influence.
Dasra Philanthropy Forum: 10 Years of Impact:
The final highlight of my trip was the Dasra Philanthropy Forum (DPF), held during UNGA week, celebrating its 10-year milestone. Dasra, once again, organized a brilliant event filled with curated panel discussions, fireside chats, and roundtables that brought together leaders and change-makers working on India’s toughest challenges. It was a huge gathering, offering a wealth of global perspectives. For me, it was a chance to meet new people, share what we’re doing at Project Tech4Dev, and listen to diverse perspectives from around the world.
Takeaways and Reflections:
Looking back on my two weeks in the US, I feel like I learned so much—both about the social impact space and about myself. The funder dinner taught me the value of short, powerful pitches and how even a five-minute talk can spark meaningful conversations. The UNGA side event reminded me of the importance of dignity in development work, something that’s easy to overlook but critical to long-term success. And the Dasra Philanthropy Forum showed me the power of collaboration and the global commitment to driving change.
All in all, it was a fulfilling trip, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit—hopefully with a bit more planning and a lot more in control!Title: Reflections from the DCP: Lessons Learned and Growth Achieved

Participating in the
Data Catalyst Program (DCP)
has been an enriching journey, offering not just an opportunity to pitch our ideas but also to introspect and learn. The experience was a melting pot of insights, feedback, and real-world challenges, pushing us to refine our approach and align our vision with practical execution. Here are the key learnings and takeaways from this transformative experience:
1. The Power of Clarity in Communication
When pitching, it’s easy to get lost in the technicalities of your solution or overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. Through this process, we learned the importance of
simplifying the narrative
. A good pitch isn’t just about sharing your work but about helping the audience connect with your purpose.
Takeaway
: Always focus on
why
the problem matters,
what
your solution achieves, and
how
it transforms lives.
2. Data Speaks Louder Than Words
A recurring theme during DCP was the emphasis on
data-driven storytelling
. While passion and purpose are important, it’s the numbers that make your pitch credible. By showcasing impact metrics—like the 230,000+ students and 4,500 government actors we serve at Medha—we were able to substantiate our claims and build trust.
Takeaway
: Let data validate your story and use it to inspire confidence.
3. Collaboration Breeds Innovation
Working alongside diverse organizations during the cohort reinforced the value of
collaboration
. From brainstorming sessions to peer feedback, we saw how aligning perspectives can lead to innovative solutions. For instance, incorporating inter-departmental collaboration into our data pipeline system was an idea inspired by this exchange.
Takeaway
: Seek feedback and build solutions
with
your stakeholders, not just
for
them.
4. Iteration is Key
One of the biggest lessons we learned was the importance of
refinement and iteration
. Feedback from mentors and peers helped us identify blind spots and improve our pitch. It wasn’t about getting it perfect the first time but about consistently getting better.
Takeaway
: Embrace feedback as a tool for growth and iteration as a path to excellence.
5. The Role of Vision in Execution
The DCP process challenged us to think not just about the immediate problem but the broader impact of our solution. For us, this meant reimagining our impact measurement process from being project-specific to
scalable across institutions and government settings
. By keeping our long-term vision front and centre, we could articulate how our work contributes to systemic change.
Takeaway
: Ground your execution in a clear, aspirational vision.
6. Technology as a Catalyst for Change
Our work in building a scalable data management framework with automation and dashboards underscored how technology, when used effectively, can catalyse change. From real-time data insights to streamlined reporting, the solutions we pitched are already making an impact on how decisions are made.
Takeaway
: Use technology to empower people and amplify outcomes.
Looking Ahead
The DCP experience has not only refined our pitching skills but also reaffirmed our commitment to building a
data-driven culture
. The lessons learned here will guide us as we scale our solution, ensuring it remains impactful, inclusive, and sustainable.
To all the organizations, mentors, and peers we engaged with—thank you for your insights, challenges, and encouragement. Together, we’re not just solving problems; we’re shaping a better future.
Special acknowledgment goes to Swapneel Rane and Aditya Krishnan, whose guidance and support were instrumental in helping us navigate this journey. Your expertise and encouragement made all the difference.

==================================================

The Udaipur Sprint held near the serene Aravali Hills was a fantastic experience that brought together familiar faces and new acquaintances from NGOs. It was refreshing to reconnect with the Tech4Dev team and meet passionate individuals dedicated to making a difference. The lush green surroundings provided the perfect backdrop for a fruitful gathering.
This year, we were fortunate to have an exceptional group of Code4GovTech interns from various colleges and universities. Their enthusiasm for their work was contagious, and they were eager to connect with NGOs; we have high hopes that some of these talented interns may continue their journey in the social sector. This group of young men and women infused the event with a sense of positive energy that was vibrant and almost therapeutic.
One of the new additions to Tech4Dev is a recent graduate from our inaugural WomenInTech cohort, who has joined as a developer. Our conversation with her shed light on the motivations of WomenInTech participants and provided valuable insights into how to encourage their active participation and foster a drive for continuous learning. Her personal journey, shaped by the program, is sure to inspire our current and future cohorts; we are confident that her story will propel them to overcome challenges and embrace their potential.
During the sprint, Ashwin, one of our CxOs, guided the Glific and DDP teams in a team review. This interactive exercise offered valuable perspectives on what strategies were effective and highlighted areas that required further attention. The insights gained from this collaborative evaluation will help us refine our approaches, strengthen teamwork, and enhance the impact we can have on the communities we serve. We eagerly anticipate more of these exercises in future sprints, as they provide an excellent platform for growth and improvement.
The sprint was a resounding success because of the attention to detail and constant supervision of Krishna Priya, Ankit, and Vikram. Their hard work ensured the smooth execution of the event, enabling participants to focus on their projects and make the most of the sprint.
It is also gratifying to witness the remarkable growth of Tech4Dev under the even-handed leadership of Erica and the relentless pursuit of excellence by Lobo. Erica’s inclusive and collaborative leadership has fostered an environment that values mutual respect and collaboration. Lobo’s unwavering commitment to excellence challenges us to push the boundaries and deliver outstanding solutions. Together, they form a formidable force driving Tech4Dev’s progress.
The event served as a reminder of the power of collective efforts and the potential for technology to drive positive change. With each sprint, Tech4Dev grows stronger, guided by inspiring leaders and fueled by the dedication of its participants. We look forward to the next chapter in this exciting journey, as we continue leveraging technology for development and making a meaningful impact on communities worldwide.Title: Reflections on My Journey with Janaagraha: Part 2
Author: Mohd Shamoon

==================================================

This blog is the second part of my reflections on my journey with Janaagraha. My association with this organization began in August last year, and I shared my initial impressions at that time. You can read those
here
Now, as I look back, I want to detail the milestones we’ve achieved and the lessons learned along the way.
Open Source Initiatives
One of my first tasks was to ensure that our repositories were secure and ready to go public. Using GitGuardian, we scanned the repositories for exposed keys or credentials and rotated them as necessary. Once the repositories were secure, we made them
public
.
Initially, this task faced delays due to higher-priority issues. It also took time for the team to adjust to my working style and timelines. With contributions from Jeeva and Kushal, we systematically resolved all key-related issues.
After this, we focused on improving the basic hygiene of the project. These included:
•
Linting
: To ensure consistent code formatting.
• Unit test cases
: To validate individual components.
• Code coverage
: To track how much of the code was being tested.
• Code quality checks
: To identify and fix potential bugs early.
I was fortunate to join Janaagraha when they had a great initiative—a weekly demo call where team members could showcase interesting technical work. I used this opportunity to present the benefits of these practices. The response from the team was overwhelmingly positive.
To further support the open-source transition, I documented everything a project needs to become a good open-source application. This included guidelines on licensing, documentation, testing, and contribution best practices. You can access the detailed document
here
.
Focus on Testing
Another key focus area was improving testing practices. The team was heavily reliant on manual testing, which consumed significant time and effort while still missing critical issues. Automated testing became a priority.
We introduced Cypress, a powerful tool for end-to-end testing. Abhishek, who joined Janaagraha at the same time as I did, quickly adapted to Cypress despite being new to it. I shared my knowledge of the tool with him, and his fast progress in writing test cases was a pleasant surprise.
We integrated Cypress Cloud, allowing us to track test results and collaborate more effectively. Our next step is to apply for an open-source plan with Cypress to leverage its advanced features at no cost. You can explore our Cypress project
here
.
To ensure sustainable growth, I created a best-practices
document
based on the official Cypress documentation. This document serves as a guide for writing maintainable and efficient test cases. While significant progress has been made, we are still expanding our test coverage to include more complex forms and workflows.
Angular Version Update
One of the recurring challenges with in-house software development is maintaining outdated applications. This is particularly common in nonprofits, where vendors often deliver software without clear documentation or a maintenance roadmap.
At Janaagraha, the Angular version was 11 when I joined. We have since upgraded to version 14, although the latest version is 18. Each major version introduces breaking changes, so we’ve adopted a phased approach. Our current focus is on increasing automated test coverage to ensure stability during future upgrades.
The key takeaway here is to prioritize regular updates and thorough documentation for any software project. Neglecting this can lead to technical debt, requiring significant resources to resolve later.
Dalgo Proof of Concept (POC)
We conducted a 40-hour POC on Dalgo, focusing on integrating data from Excel sheets and a MongoDB database. The process began with defining requirements and calculations and ended with building dashboards using Superset.
Sudhakar, a key contributor, handled much of the setup work, including configuring sources, destinations, and syncing tables. Since the team was unfamiliar with DBT, I wrote models based on the table structure and shared them with Sudhakar, enabling him to build dashboards.
There were some challenges with data accuracy, but these were resolved through close collaboration and improved understanding. We also encountered limitations with Superset’s map charts, which we documented for future reference.
Finally, we integrated the dashboards into the CityFinance app as an iframe. The feedback was positive, and the project is currently in the approval process, with finalization expected by the end of January.
Server Architecture Changes
Another significant initiative was reworking the server architecture. Previously, the application and database were hosted on a single machine. We conducted a proof of concept to separate these components, resulting in a more scalable and efficient setup.
Key Steps:
1. Autoscaling Group:
We created an autoscaling group with two nodes and a load balancer.
2. Deployment Methods:
• Method 1:
Use CodeDeploy to pull the code from GitHub, build it on the server, and deploy. While functional, this approach was time-consuming and resource-intensive.
• Method 2:
Pre-build files were stored in an S3 bucket, and CodeDeploy was used to copy the files to the server. This method significantly reduced deployment time and server load.
Additionally, we used AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing and managing credentials.
During testing, we identified a bottleneck in the database server, which limited simultaneous users to 10. Upon inspection, we found that the server spec was really  low. Also MongoDB version (v4) was outdated and configured as a standalone instance. MongoDB now recommends a replica set configuration for better scalability and reliability.
We upgraded to MongoDB v7 and connected it to the test environment. While the setup performed well, I had reservations about managing a three-server replica set. A managed service like MongoDB Atlas would simplify this process significantly. I created a cost comparison
sheet
between EC2 and Atlas and recommended moving to Atlas, pending budget approval. Talks with the Atlas team are underway, and we’re hopeful about securing six months of free credits.
Writing and Sharing
I firmly believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. It helps individuals grow and fosters collaboration.
I encouraged the team to write about their work and share it publicly. It was incredibly rewarding to see Kushal and Sudhakar write blogs about their contributions. You can read their blogs(
Kushal’s blog
,
Sushakar’s blog
). Promoting a culture of writing and knowledge-sharing is something I will continue to champion in any organization I work with.
Documenting Key Processes and Knowledge Management
We are working on documenting processes and creating a centralized knowledge repository. This includes:
• Guidelines for starting new projects.
• Basic health checks for applications.
• Shared resources on a centralized drive.
Currently, documents are fragmented, but the goal is to consolidate them for easy access and reference.
Learnings and Takeaways
This was my first engagement as part of the Fractional CXO team, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. Working with a dedicated team taught me invaluable lessons:
1. Proactive Communication:
Don’t hesitate to follow up or escalate issues if things aren’t moving.
2. Building Trust:
Spending time with the organization helps build personal connections, which are critical for aligning goals and driving progress. For future engagements, I plan to spend at least a month on-site.
3. Focus on Sustainability:
It’s impossible to fix everything. Set realistic, focused goals that can be sustained after your involvement ends. Always connect with the right people and ensure a shared vision for long-term success.
I’m grateful for the opportunities and learnings from this engagement and look forward to seeing how these initiatives evolve.Title: Reflections on Our Shillong Sprint Experience

==================================================

After my summer visit to Shillong, I raved about the beauty and the NGO ecosystem out there, and the Tech4Dev team decided they wanted to do our next “sprint” in Shillong. It’s a long way off for all of us, and we ensured that folks made use of the location by coming a few days early and/or staying a few days later. I’m glad we decided to go there since we had a blast, and the best sprint ever 🙂
The morning circle to kick off the sprint outdoors @ Wards Lake
As always, a list of some of my observations and thoughts, on the sprint and our evolution. What has changed, where we’ve stepped up, and some reflections
• I need to start by acknowledging that our team meetings have been planned well. This sprint was a perfect combination of the right number of meetings, a couple of excursions, and enough time for in-depth conversations and some work time. Kudos to the organizers: Diana Gomes, Radhika Bhagwat, Pratishka Rao, and Priyesh Sikariwal, for a job well done.
• Starting the sprint with a walk to nearby Wards Lake was a stroke of genius. It got everyone outside, the weather was quite good, and we got some exercise but set the overall tone of the sprint, relaxed and focused simultaneously.
• Always amazed at many of the things Ashwin Srinivasan does. This time, we did a retrospective exercise of each of our groups (Glific, Dalgo, Fractional CxO, HR & Finance). We got the teams to reflect on various aspects of group dynamics, personal growth, and product questions. Later in the week, he also coordinated a hackathon, which was nominated as the favorite activity by many of us. It was interesting to see a few quick PoCs developed and demoed.
• I took the opportunity to go on a few long treks with some of the team members the weekend before and after the sprint. Managed to knock off Double Decker Bridge, David Scott Trail, and the Bamboo Trail. It was nice to have long walks and conversations with people outdoors while we were huffing and puffing. Also learned a lot more about a few of our team members over conversations at the bar. I do hope we can maintain the culture of our “tribe” as we grow and evolve.
• We had a few folks who were relatively new, with Saurabh (our senior AI person) starting at the sprint. It was interesting to see their perspectives change over the week as they had more conversations and interacted with NGOs
• We’ve done a “Chai pe Charcha” event at our last two sprints, where we invited local NGOs to our event to learn more about our work, as well as for our team to understand their needs and challenges. This year we extended it by also providing a one-on-one session with our senior technologists for a smaller group of NGOs. Overall this is a great experience for the team, and I hope quite useful to the local community also.
• We do a happiness survey with the team twice a year to get a pulse on how the team is feeling and areas of concern or improvement. Erica, Vinod, and I discuss this along with other relevant topics as a reality check of the state of Tech4Dev. Overall things are progressing well and folks are happy, but we do need to ensure that we meet the career goals and aspirations of the team.
• At the sprint, we started work on the design and architecture of our AI Platform (coming early next quarter). We also kickstarted the planning of our pilot on the Tech4Dev Grassroots Initiative. Happy that we are experimenting and attempting to meet the evolving needs of the sector
• We had a few good meetings with The Change Engine, Veddis Foundation, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on our work, our goals, and how we can potentially integrate our work with government systems. We do think that usage of our platforms at the government level will increase and we’ll need to ensure that we are sustainable with this work also. We will need to start thinking of building our System Integrator (SI) network to help us with this work both from an implementation and sustainability viewpointTitle: Reflections on an Inspiring Visit to CORO Office in Mumbai

==================================================

Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the CORO office in Mumbai alongside my colleague
Rajeev
. Our visit was filled with productive meetings and engaging discussions with various teams. One of our primary focuses was on getting a deeper understanding of the COROs Grassroot Leadership Development Program/GDLP and being able to get clarity on the org tech priorities.
During our visit, we engaged in fruitful discussions with several of CORO’s program teams, including the Women Empowerment Program, Right to Pee, Gender Sensitisation, and Water Scarcity Program.
Rahul, the leader of the Grassroot Leadership Development Program, provided us with comprehensive insights into the current state of the program. We discussed aspects that can be digitized in the near future, as well as the program’s long-term plans. This discussion allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the program’s goals and strategies.
We also had the pleasure of meeting Sabera, a dedicated volunteer who brings valuable expertise in IT, project management, and HRMS implementation from her diverse experiences in various companies.
Pallavi, a trustee of CORO, joined us during our discussions. It was valuable to have the larger team come together to understand the objectives and initiatives that the CxOs are driving, ensuring alignment across all levels of the organization.
Shivani and Shrikanth, who have been actively supporting the tech journey through the Fractional CxO project since its inception, actively participated in our conversations. They emphasized the importance of collaboration and finding common ground among all the projects to establish an organization-wide tech roadmap.
We dedicated significant time to consolidating requirements and streamlining project management across the various programs within CORO. It was inspiring to witness the commitment and dedication of the teams in identifying similarities and differences between the initiatives.
Another remarkable encounter was with Suryakant, the lead of the Water Scarcity Program. Suryakant shared his journey of starting the project without any technical expertise, then acquiring knowledge in hydrogeology to make a significant impact on multiple villages. The team’s focus on water equity, particularly addressing disparities in water consumption among individuals with larger and smaller land holdings, was commendable.
Throughout our visit, we were amazed by the expertise and passion displayed by CORO’s team members. They diligently worked on challenges related to expense management, advance settlements, and digitization of the Leadership Development Program. The determination to find innovative solutions and drive positive change was truly inspiring.
And let’s not forget to mention the amazing lunch we had during our visit. It was a delightful experience, felt like home, and added an extra touch of enjoyment to our day.
Looking ahead, our next steps involve collaborating with the GLDP team for digitization efforts and exploring an Expense Management Tool. Additionally,
Rajeev
will be working with the Women Empowerment Team to implement the CRC (Community Resource Center) Tool.
These two days spent at CORO’s Mumbai office were remarkable. As visitors from Delhi and Bangalore, we felt safe and welcomed in the city. The openness and warmth displayed by the people at CORO left a lasting impression. Furthermore, we developed meaningful connections and friendships during our visit, which we hope to nurture in the future.
Thank you, CORO, for the incredible experience and the opportunity to witness firsthand the impactful work being done to create positive change in communities.
PS: Unfortunately, we forgot to capture any images during our visit, except for a selfie.Title: Reimagining communication with your Beneficiaries

Re-imagining your style of communication in current times would potentially help deepen your impact. Glific is one of the technology tools that could enable you to build personalised connections.
Glific is a two-way-communication tool that runs on WhatsApp platform. This tool could potentially help you answer the following questions that you might have come across while building your impact model, such as,
How might we increase our reach from a few hundreds to thousands of beneficiaries?
How can we automate our conversations?
Is it a challenge to align the right staff member to the right beneficiary?
How might we conduct online programs more often with lesser manpower?
If you have built an organisation that can solve social issues at a local level, this is the time when you could think of scaling up your reach. Right technology tools and better implementation strategies can accelerate your impact. Youve probably been taking small steps and now its time to take some giant leaps for society.
Glific is developed keeping NGO and social development sectoral requirements in focus and conversations at the centre of it. With the in-built features such as setting up automation, quick replies, integration with external machine learning engines etc, Glific could help build an effective communication strategy of an NGO. It is intuitive and easy to use with no prior knowledge of any programming language or coding skills.
Key steps that can help to start your journey in building your communication strategy:
Identify the problem statement that you want to address with your intervention
Identify whether your proposed solution involves communication/conversation with your beneficiaries.
If your solution involves a conversation, then you might have to imagine the ideal flow of conversation that you would like to have with your beneficiaries. This would serve as a north-star for your communication strategy.
Once you have your north-star, running a pilot with few beneficiaries would help position your north-star.
Identify a business service provider and the technology platform that could help you reach your communication goal.
A change even for a better system and process involves some resistance in the beginning. NGOs can get more prepared for that by following the above steps to re-imagine communication. Connecting with your problem statement and the communication process would be a crucial first step and hence the biggest takeaway for this article is to sketch out your communication flow.

==================================================

Most people think of the Bay Area as an especially tech-savvy place, but the reality is that the local continuum of care is plagued by an inability to leverage the technology ecosystem right on its doorstep. There are many reasons why this is the case, and part of our work on the ReferAll Initiative is to improve our understanding of these causes.
We?re inspired by
Survivor Alliance
?s founder Minh Dang, who contributes this evaluation framework for anti-trafficking providers and activists: for every action and initiative, consider how and to what extent it supports
survivor well-being
.  For each provider and process we evaluate, the foundational question will be ?how and with what success does this process help the provider support survivor well-being??
Our working hypothesis is that high cost of living/housing in the Bay Area combined with underpaid and overstressed staff with insufficient mental health support for secondary trauma results in (i) high staff attrition and loss of institutional knowledge of tools like technology, (ii) resistance to any data entry and management not driven by funders, and (iii) lack of executive time to improve internal processes, and (iv) persistent scarcity of funding that results in cuts to critical resources.  In other words, the cost of running a shelter or case management program is inherently higher in the Bay Area than in any other US geography, and shelters make do with less in a way that detracts from the continuum of care.
Based on this hypothesis, we have defined the following research goals for the provider evaluation portion of our efforts:
Identify critical pain points in providing a full stage in the continuum of care at a variety of shelters to support product prioritization
Over the years, we?ve heard providers complain of high staff turnover, low staff compensation, lack of funding, and onerous processes mandated by funder reporting obligations, especially to the State of California and for federal grants, as key pain points.  Survivors cite the lack of staff training and preparedness, a lack of trauma-informed operational models, severely limited staff working hours, and onerous admissions processes as the critical factors in provider failures to deliver support.
In some cases, survivors also report abuses of food stamp eligibility and hate speech at providers. Any such requirements or considerations will be documented alongside care provision and benefits offered by the shelter to develop a full cost-benefit analysis of each provider from the survivor perspective.  In addition, we?ll document providers? expressed pain points that led to their criteria, documentation, and residency requirements.
2. Identify operational process gaps and recommend technology or process improvements to fill them
Most providers report that their internal documentation and record keeping processes are driven predominantly by funder reporting requirements, not operational needs in serving survivors.
We?ll catalogue the funder reporting requirements that apply to help us define how to build later-stage software that auto-completes these reports. More importantly, we?ll dive deep with staff on what they really lack in their efforts to serve survivors and support survivor well-being because of the work they must do to meet reporting requirements.
3. Identify and document capacity of and requirements for admission to shelter providers
There is an inherent conflict in the requirements for messaging that supports fundraising efforts and the messaging that survivors review to evaluate whether they qualify for help at a particular provider.  For funders, providers are incentivized to represent a larger capacity for a wider range of services. For potential beneficiaries, providers are constrained by resources and often cannot support each offering listed on their 990 form or website for each survivor, and must honestly report this fact. We believe it is critical to identify the reality of capacity and turnover on the ground level to build solutions.  However, we recognize that providers need this research to remain confidential so that it does not impede or conflict with fundraising efforts.
4.
Assess turnover rate in beneficiaries at participating shelters
The number of beds or therapy slots at any shelter is not a useful measurement without the context of turnover rates. Consider two scenarios:
Four beds are available, and residents generally occupy them for 12 month stretches
Four beds are available, and residents generally occupy them for 3-4 days
Obviously, these two providers would not only serve a drastically different number of individuals, but would also deliver a drastically different benefit to each survivor. Problematically, in scenario (2), the provider would be able to report on a substantially HIGHER number of beneficiaries, which many funders hope to see in an effort to increase their own grant impact measurements. However, it is clear that provider (1) is making more of a contribution towards a full continuum of care and to survivor well-being. Three days of shelter is too often a mere hiatus from exploitation.
5.
Assess turnover rate in staff at participating shelters
Anyone becomes better at a job the longer they do it. For providers whose staff have years of experience in their role, the likelihood of delivering trauma-informed, compassionate care increases substantially.  Moreover, the likelihood of personal networks with other providers in the continuum of care increases, allowing each individual staff member to coordinate or support more of the continuum for each beneficiary.
By contrast, staff hired and departed within the space of a few months barely have time to learn client?s names, much less the details of a cse that are necessary to coordinate personalized support and survivor well-being.
In both staff and beneficiary turnover, in addition to understanding WHAT causes turnover, we seek to document WHY turnover is happening – and how it could be fixed.
6.
Survey funder-mandated reporting technologies in use at participating shelters
Colleagues working in the anti-trafficking movement have reported as many as NINE different, disparate funder reporting platforms staff at providers must use on an ongoing basis.  In many cases, these systems require inputs of the same data over and over again. Many are electronic, but others are not.
Before planning the architecture for intake functions of our survivor-facing application, we believe it is critical to survey and document the various reporting tools common among shelters to design an application framework that can ultimately create the appropriate data and impact measurements – as well as compiling that data into a tool for auto-filling reports.
7.
Survey case management technologies in use at participating shelters and case management organizations
Anecdotally, we know that not many Bay Area shelters even use software for case management. Those who do not report that they simply cannot motivate staff to use any more software or do any more data entry than what their funders require. In addition, many express confidentiality concerns in submitting personal information to any software platform because they do not feel equipped to evaluate the privacy and security of the platform.
In part, this phase of research will help us identify what, if any, existing case management technologies could be readily adopted by these providers. More importantly, this will help us to generate a detailed accounting of what case management platforms our survivor application will need to integrate with, which may also drive the design of the survivor application back-end.

==================================================

About RCI-VAW
The RCI-VAW(Resource Centre for Interventions on Violence against Women)  was started in the year 2008 under the Centre for Equity for Women,  Children and Families and School of Social Work. It engages in a  consistent and sustainable manner with the issues of Violence against  Women. The RCI-VAW nurtures effective interventions with different stakeholders through training and research to enable a deeper understanding of the issue and interventions to stop Violence against  Women.
Current Process
RCI-VAW runs special cells for women. The special cell is actually a  police station based unit which helps or aims to eliminate violence against women and children. When a woman registers a case it is registered in an Intake Register and is assigned a PU number (unique ID  for the case. A case letter with date and time mentioned is sent to the respondent and the same is noted in the Diary or Register. The Cell coordinator then calls the respondent for a first individual meeting,  depending on the case Joint and Group meeting sessions are organized. A case once registered is never closed and the cell coordinator can access the last 3 years data.
Project Details
We are working to automate their process to help the social worker with case and cell activity tracking at Special Cells. This would improve their data accuracy and the captured data will be used to improve their reporting process by generating monthly and quarterly progress reports.
The team related to this project consists of Social Workers, Special Cell Coordinators, and Research Officers.
Project Requirements
Collection of basic case details through the mobile or web application.
Social workers at Special Cells will feed in data into the app.
Data accessibility based on roles assigned to social workers and coordinators.
Automated reports for Social WorkersQuarterly progress report
Monthly progress report
Automated reports for Special Cell CoordinatorsMonthly progress report
Quarterly progress report
Half yearly progress report
Technology Solution
We have used Primero an open source software for our previous project  HAQ. After analyzing the requirement for RCI-VAW we think that Primero might be a good fit for this project as well. The development of the project has started in the last week of June.
Any suggestions and feedback are most welcomed.Title: Roadmap for co-creating the Fiscal Data Explorer
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: July 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/roadmap-for-co-creating-the-fiscal-data-explorer/
==================================================

The Tech4Dev collaboration between CivicDataLab and Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability aims at developing a comprehensive dashboard called the Fiscal Data Explorer with Himachal Pradesh(HP) as the focus state. This dashboard will be a unique addition to the already existing data platform,
Open Budgets India
(OBI), in bringing together data on state budget allocations for Himachal and its spending data in a single tool.
What makes state fiscal data so complex?
Citizen?s access to data on government budgets in India diminishes drastically as we go deeper from the level of the Union Government to the sub-national levels. The low usability of state budget documents is also compounded by the fact that most of the detailed information is locked away in closed formats like PDF and hence cannot be read or consumed by machines. Further, the lack of metadata hinders the process of easy searchability for relevant fiscal data.
When it comes to data on actual spending of these allocated funds at the district level, only a handful of states actually do bring out this information in the public domain. Even for this latter subset of the states, district spending data is associated with complicated coding structures making it difficult to comprehend for the uninitiated users. Needless to say, such hurdles at the state and district level, crucially restrict public engagement with fiscal data and in turn, constrain public participation with fiscal issues.
What is Fiscal Data Explorer?
Fiscal Data Explorer is a unique tool where citizens can explore both budgets and spending data of state governments in an easy to comprehend and simple to use manner. Such a dashboard can enable users to obtain answers to their budget-related queries in an interactive fashion. Some of the key features to assist the users in their exploration are downloadable data in machine-readable formats, easily searchable data tables, dynamic visualizations, etc.
What are we trying to address?
The proposed project will aim at solving the dual problems of lack of easy accessibility to detailed information on state budgets and spending data in specific states and the lack of usability of such data due to the manner in which it is shared in the public domain. Further, with the introduction of comprehensive metadata, the Fiscal Data Explorer will help different user groups to curate information and insights in a more transparent and organized manner. With such an intervention, we expect to facilitate greater public engagement with both budgets at the state level and spending data at the district level.
What will be the components/elements of Fiscal Data Explorer?
The following are the various components/elements which will be included in the dashboard:
Money Flow:
This will provide aggregate and detailed information about the inflow and outflow of money in a state.?
Overall Budget (Budget Highlights)
: This will provide a brief representation of the budget on an aggregate level and information like major schemes, announcements, etc.
Expenditure:
This will be divided into the following parts for easy dissemination of expenditure information as follows:
Expenditure Summary:
This section will give an overall gist of how the state has performed in terms of its expenditure across years and among sectors.
Detailed Expenditure:
The objective of this part will be to dig deeper and give granular insights into each department, commonly classified as different demand numbers or grant numbers.
Expenditure Tracker:
This will help the user to track how money is being spent on a daily and monthly basis across various districts and expenditure heads.
Receipts
: This will be divided into the following parts for easy dissemination of expenditure information as follows:
Detailed Receipts:
Structured to provide both aggregates as well as granular insights on different sources of receipts like tax, non-tax revenue receipts, etc.
Receipts Tracker:
This will enable the user to track how receipts are being collected on a daily and monthly basis across various districts and receipts heads.?
Schemes:
This will provide detailed information related to various schemes across the years.?
Sectors:
This will provide sectoral information and comprehensive representation of how individual sectors have performed across the years. It will also enable inter-sectoral comparisons in the state and its various districts.
What has been our roadmap for developing the dashboard?
The unique feature of this project has been the close association between public finance knowledge and the sound application of technological solutions to it. Needless to say, the technical, research and design roadmaps towards developing this dashboard are dependent on one another and naturally do have overlapping segments.
On the technical front, the following are the steps are being planned out

What do we expect this tool to achieve?
We expect this tool to facilitate strengthened engagement with openly accessible public finance data at the state and district level by researchers, journalists and other stakeholder groups.? A deeper understanding of the priorities of the state government and the performances of the states in raising their revenues and spending the allocated funds have the potential to build stronger advocacy routes with the concerned government authorities by the civil society organizations. In doing so, the fiscal data on this proposed dashboard can be made extensive use of and therein lies its potential.?

==================================================

This blog is written by Prashast from Saajha
The context – when we (almost) found the silver bullet
Back in 2021, when we launched our own WhatsApp chatbot and calling solution, one of the biggest complaint from our team was that the parents were not picking up the call. We thought we were not calling at an appropriate time and plotted the pick up rate by hour of the day/week to create a heat-map of call pick-up rates. Evenings, in general between 6-8 p.m. and Saturday in particular showed some increase in call pick-up rates. We decided to integrate it operationally, by attempting most calls during the said hours. But there was hardly any significant increase in the call pick-up rates. It was months before we realized what we had missed. The first analysis to identify optimal slots was for first calls (essentially cold-calls) while the subsequent ones were to parents with whom we had spoken once. The experience pushed us to look systematically at data to make meaningful decisions and eventually setting up a separate data function.
Slow and steady!
Since then, we have been able to make slow and incremental changes to the way we look data, but the pace is far slower than both – how the sector has been evolving, and how our operational needs have evolved. Our participation in the Data Catalyst Program has, thus, came at the right juncture, helping us rework our approach to data management. In a short span of just a few weeks, here is what we have learned.
Data function is more than analyzing data faster and accurately –
Our efforts for building our data function were largely focused on ensuring that we are able to draw richer insights faster from what we collect. However, the data culture rubric, and the initial session helped us realize the several other domains that we would need to prioritize.
It would take patience to get your data story right to any external stakeholder –
The FAST train exercise started with questions which seemed very independent of each other; it was not until we reached the stage of articulation, that we were able to see how these elements were interconnected, and the rest of the story flowed.
Experiments and innovations can be systemized –
Our approach to experiments had been to look at excel sheets longer, hoping some creative insights would pop out. Experiments, however, can be approached in a very systematic manner – by defining metrics, finding counterfacutals, and using the right analysis.
Metrics have to be closely aligned with the parent journey –
Metrics that we used to track in the initial phase of journey were aligned to the external stakeholders and not the parents whom we are supporting. Funnel metrics, that is tracking percentage of parents who drop out at various stages and associating costs at each stage are much more helpful and relevant.
A lot that we do can be done automatically –
A large portion of our time is currently spent on merging data sets and doing basic analysis. Tools like Dalgo, and ChatGPT can be of significant help in ensuring that these analysis are faster and more efficient.
Beyond the sessions, the exercise was also an opporunity to hear other fascinating stories, from other not-for-profits, and partner organizations. We hope that we are able to replicate a part of these stories in our journey, here at Saajha!Title: SeSTA FMS Project Status

==================================================

This blog is written by the SeSTA team
The Data Catalyst Program, 2023 was a great opportunity for Seven Sisters Development Assistance (SeSTA), as this was one of its kind focused on data related processes and strategies. It gave us a lot of insights on various tools available for not-for-profits and how other organization are utilizing those tools.
As SeSTA is progressing onto a data driven organization, this event came right in time to handle our future goals. Having its own data collection application in place, it is moving forward on how to utilize its collected data to bring out decision making capabilities for its benefits. Therefore, this event aced the purpose which helped us to improvise our data flow, how we can do better in terms of designing our data collection and visualization processes. During the event we also got the opportunity to interaction and input from peers and like-minded people helped a lot in the learning process of their existing data systems in place.
Following which, there were also case studies given out to the peers to understand concepts like data culture, data levers that are essential based on an organizations strength and areas of development while considering its problem statement. This exercise itself gave us clarity on what should be the approach while considering the possible levers for our organization, in terms of data collection strategies.
Another insightful take away for SeSTA was the understanding of how LLM and AI works. This is the generation belonging to the technology world and we are excited to get along with it. We are thankful to our assigned PoCs and hosts for such sharp, exciting and rejuvenating sessions. We are looking forward to the next few months of our work flow together.Title: SeSTA: Field Visit

==================================================

Web Access
will be working with
SeSTA
as a part of the second cohort to implement the FPO Management System (FMS) which will be deployed at various FPO’s supported by SeSTA.
About SeSTA
Seven Sisters Development Assistance (SeSTA) is a culmination of efforts to initiate development work to empower communities in remote rural areas of NE India. Registered in the year 2011, under Societies Registration Act (SRA), 1860, SeSTA was conceived to put systematic effort into the socio-economic development of NE by building capabilities of poor communities, promoting and strengthening their institutions to facilitate them out of poverty and meaningfully participate in the global economy.
SeSTA collectivizes women to form Self Help Groups (SHGs), builds their capabilities and strengthens livelihood systems to alleviate mass poverty in far-flung villages of Northeast India. Scientific agriculture interventions in food crop and vegetable crops, Natural Resources Management and supporting the intensification and diversification of other livelihoods portfolio like goat rearing, piggery, fisheries, mushroom cultivation, access to clean energy, work on gender justice and governance has helped economically and socially empower communities in these villages.
Problem Statement
One challenge faced by SeSTA is tracking the activities carried out by the Community Service Providers. They are paid by depending on the activities done by hence, it?s very crucial.
Another challenge faced by SeSTA is that as of now there is no system to track the loan repayment process and the intimation of the due date of repayment process to the loanee because of which there are few loan defaulters. It gets difficult to track the excel sheets as there are a large number of shareholders. Currently, around 500 shareholders have been given credit facilities from the FPO’s.
We visited the SeSTA office in Guwahati and also did a field visit to FPO in order to understand the system on the ground.
We were able to nail down various open items and clear out our understanding of the project. Based on our discussion we have finalized the project scope for this cohort.
Project Scope
The project scope document is available at
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rL0SFoXS4SUKqA6K4AWQUy0Kn7aGGzWjK7RFENS-M-Q/edit?usp=sharing
The next task is to work on the Planning document and detail the implementation plan for the project. We also plan to start the work on the mockups for various screens.Title: Second education sprint: Learnings from NGOs

Engagement is one crucial factor that people dont take into account while building a chatbot. It sometimes needs personalized content, nudges and various other forms of engagement with the beneficiaries to get them to adapt a bot.
Reports and dashboards are a fundamental requirement in measuring the bots efficiency, reach and the overall program results. Thanks to various NGOs talking about it in the sprint we are planning to get the next version of the Glific template report in the coming weeks.
Support and documentation is one crucial factor if you want to build a chatbot with Glific. While we try our utmost to help NGOs in their issues ,there is sometimes a gap which is an incremental process of learning and which will help to support NGOs better.
Learnings I was able to give:
Hopefully I was able to help people thinking in terms of how NLP can be used seeing the
TAP
and
DanaVidya
use cases.
To explain what Glific does in its entirety and the tech components it uses to multiple people in the sprint. (which as I am thinking now could have been a collaborative session)
Interesting conversation that got me hooked:
The conversation where Arun shared how he used punch cards and had to write the programs which had a maximum three tries of compilation. It was really interesting to talk to someone who has seen the tech industry in India from its start and see it developed over time to a place it has reached today.
While I was sharing how I got hooked into programming with Gayatri and Arun, It made a lot of sense to show other people tech in the same light and get them interested.
The thought process of coming up with the values of an organization was an interesting one shared by Arjav. In my organization ColoredCow we were also trying to come up with values of the organization and it was interesting to see all the thoughts that came out especially the lived values vs aspirational values.
Swapnil shared about his experience of doing a 2-month rural immersion program at NIRMA and how that got him towards the social sector. Similarly I got to listen to stories of Tejas and Vandana as to how they started within their respective organizations by starting with some volunteer work at first.
The story of how Tech4dev started with the collaboration and thought process of people working towards the same goal.
Fun and food.
For food I have just one word-
Awesome.
Kurund would back me up on that since whenever I met him in the sprint I always had some food in my hand which became a joke till the end of the sprint.
Robbers Cave:
Struggling against the water to reach at the end and people losing their slippers and I lost the key to the locker that holds most of our phones and belongings.
Lost walk from Sal Woods:
It was a simple walk from the resort in the evening where me and Ankit were the lead and thanks to mine and Vandanas great sense of direction we lost the way. It was really fascinating to see how people react in different ways in these situations. Some super calm, some afraid, some absolutely neutral.
Bus ride to Mussoorie:
I got to listen to so many old and good songs while playing Antakshari from some of the best singers there Kurund, Abhideep. Sanchita and Ankit.
Exploding kitten and happy hours:
The card master Akhilesh showed us how to play for fun and win the game. Really enjoyed the late night game sessions with the folks.Title: Selecting schemes and sectors for Himachal Fiscal Data Explorer: Process and Criteria

==================================================

The background research for developing the schemes and sectors wise data for the
Fiscal Data Explorer
involves a number of steps. While deciding on the different components for the dashboard, a lot of stress was put on the users? demands for consuming fiscal data pertaining to different sectors and on various government schemes and programmes. Correspondingly, our journey began of selecting and tracking relevant sectors and prominent schemes in Himachal Pradesh.
Channels of Fund Flow to a District
Source:
http://www.cbgaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Budget-and-Expenditure-Information-at-District-Level-Policy-Brief.pdf
Tracking the money flow in such schemes becomes increasingly difficult as we move from the level of the Union Government to states and subsequently to the districts due to the complexity in the structure of fund flow and the multiplicity in the fund flow channels. Moreover, only a handful of states actually do bring out this information in the public domain. Even for this latter subset of states, district spending data is associated with complicated coding structures making it difficult to comprehend for the uninitiated user. Needless to say, such hurdles at the state and district level, crucially restrict public engagement with fiscal data and in turn constrain public participation with fiscal issues. In this regard, the present dashboard, in addition, to budget data for the state, will also take into consideration the data available on schemes from the district treasuries of Himachal and present them in a simple to use format.
Curating Sectoral Data
Creating a sectoral database with fiscal data (budget and spending data) is a complicated process. Often, the relevant budget heads pertaining to a sector, like education or nutrition, are not found in a single source but lie scattered in the detailed budget books of several government departments.
Collating relevant budget heads of education requires going through the detailed budget books of more than 40 departments which contribute towards the total financial resources of the education sector in a financial year.
For example, the annual publication by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD):
Analysis of Budgeted Expenditure on Education
, lists 42 different ministries/departments in addition to MHRD that are relevant for capturing the budgeted expenditure on education and training at the Centre. It is thus necessary to curl out such information from these multiple sources and present it in standardised and consumable formats. Moreover, such an approach, of mapping any sectoral data leaves open the possibility of subjectivity in the definitions used. Careful qualification of the data mapping (detailed concordance tables) for respective sectors thus becomes crucial.
For the purpose of developing the dashboard, we have tried to attain greater horizontal coverage by mapping department-wise data for all departments in Himachal. In addition to this, we will also be deep-diving into one particular sector, namely, children.  Thus, we have taken a two-pronged approach for capturing detailed budget and spending data for different sectors or segments of the population. Such an approach is more straightforward and can be verified easily with the published source of information.
The decision for narrowing down on children, as the sector of choice, comes against the backdrop of 2019 being the 30th year of the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC). India being a signatory to the UNCRC, is committed to fulfilling the rights of the children in the country. However, India records high
child mortality rates
and several recent cases of child deaths in
Gorakhpur
,
Kota
and elsewhere have brought to the forefront the urgent need for safeguarding the welfare of children. To achieve this, adequate public resources and proper implementation of the government schemes and programmes are imperative. In the sectors sub-section of the dashboard, we would be exploring the sectoral commitments made by the state government of Himachal Pradesh in the last budget cycle and tracking a set of select schemes on child health, nutrition, education and development. It is important to be mentioned here that, this is
not an exhaustive set of government programmes on children
in the state but is restricted to the ones which can be tracked through the treasury.
For bringing together sectoral data on children, we have depended heavily on the framework of analysis established and followed by organisations like HAQ, CBGA and others who have been working in this domain for the last few years. We aim to put forward detailed budget and spending data on child-related schemes through this dashboard which can be consumed by a wide range of users including researchers, journalists, policymakers and CSOs in their analysis.
Schemes selection in Fiscal Data Explorer
For the purpose of developing the schemes section of the dashboard, we have curated a list of 21 carefully selected schemes, both from the domain of
Centrally Sponsored Schemes
(CSS) and State Schemes. The dashboard tracks a number of CSS like Mid Day Meal, Integrated Child Care Services, National Food Security Mission, etc. from state to districts. In addition to the central schemes, the Fiscal Data Explorer will also be reporting the budgeted allocations and expenditure on several state schemes like Children Home, Beti Hai Anmol, Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana, etc.
The logic behind the selection of the schemes has been two-fold:
Firstly, we have focused on the gamut of schemes from crucial social and economic sectors like education, health, nutrition, agriculture, etc.
Secondly, we have narrowed down on the schemes which flow through the treasury and hence, can be tracked through the same
The Schemes Tracker of Himachal Pradesh can be filtered in steps to obtain the month-wise trend of Gross and Net Payments for a particular scheme. The screenshot below captures the filtered search of a crucial Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, Integrated Child Care Services, on the tracker. The filters on the left panel will guide the users on selecting the particular scheme, the type of scheme, the district of interest and the corresponding treasury and Drawing and Disbursing Officer and so on.

https://superset.civicdatalab.in/superset/dashboard/hp-schemes-tracker/
The dashboard will also represent a month-wise distribution of net payments for select schemes for exploration by a wide range of users. The snapshot below shows how the trend of net payments for select state schemes in Himachal has been. An interesting observation is that the agriculture sector scheme, Rajya Krishi Yantrikaran Programme, has observed spending very late into the year, i.e,.only starting from the last month of the second quarter.

We hope the explorer will be able to put forward many more such interesting observations and insights from the budget and spending data of Himachal Pradesh. The development of the Fiscal Data Explorer will be a step-wise process with several additions and refinements incorporated into it subsequently.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2020
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/setco-project-covid-impact/
==================================================

Come 2020, and COVID-19, came out of nowhere and disrupted our ways of living. Every individual, every organization was impacted in one way or the other. For most NGOs this led to a disruption in both their operations as well as funds.
Setco Foundation being a CSR activity of Setco Automotive, the unprecedented COVID blow, did not immediately impact their funds, but it did impact their day-to-day operations.
Being working into health care domain and primarily for mother and child care, their work usually led to health care workers working on field with mothers, children, pregnant women and adolescent girls. Versus the backend office people would take care of the data digitization, program designing for beneficiaries and evaluating the program impacts.
But, with the advent of COVID, they had to stop all their field work. And for the backend office people, first few days of lockdown were spent in setting up the logistics around work from home.
This was the same time, when we were planning to kick start work on Setco project using Avni. Owing to sudden disruption in the ways of working, the project was put on hold for two weeks. This two week period helped Setco team setup right infrastructure for working from home ? which also later on helped us (the software partners) to kick start the project exactly after two weeks.
The project deliverable for Setco, consists of following modules
Maternal and child health
Child nutrition and development
Adolescent health
Preschool
Reports and
Importing of legacy data
Of the above, so far we?ve started work on Maternal and child health module and have been able to carve out forms for pregnant woman registration and enrollment into the Antenatal Care (ANC) program, along with scheduling of ANC visits. While doing this, we?ve been in constant interaction with the Setco POC and have been getting feedback from him on the work developed so far. Since work from home is a new concept for their industry, so at times, there have been a little delay in getting response to some questions, but so far so good.Title: Setco – 18th Feb 2020

==================================================

Setco foundation was chosen as one of the tech beneficiaries for Cohort – 2 of the Tech4Dev program.
The foundation works with marginalized communities on the issue of maternal and child health (with the aim to eradicate child malnutrition) through its project named KHUSHI in the tribal block of Kalol from Panchamahal district of Gujarat.
They have community health workers in 18 community areas who are primarily responsible for providing and facilitating prenatal and post-natal services, delivery services, newborn care, under 6 years child care and pre-school education of 3 to 6 years children.
Here?s a quick list of programs that Setco plans to implement through Tech4Dev?s second cohort –
Maternal and Child health,
Child Nutrition,
Adolescent health and
Pre-school education
To discuss these programs in detail, we (Soft Corner team) visited Setco?s Kalol office in the first week of February. The visit was both insightful and productive. During the visit, Dr Ambadas Adhav, the point of contact person from Setco, toured us to Kalol village, where the health workers work. We had a good chat with the supervisors who explained us
That they have divided the village into 18 areas and identify each area by a block number.
There are health workers alloted to each block who are responsible for data collection and enrollments of villagers into different programs
To start with, in the month of April, Setco health workers do an annual census of the village, during which they make a note of all the additions / deletions in the village.
Then later on the 2nd day of every month, the field worker goes to every household and interacts with them. This is where they get Adolescent girls enrolled in their ?Adolescent health? program, or pregnant women enrolled in the ?Maternal and Child health?  and so on.
The data collected by health workers is noted down manually into registers.
The supervisors have an overview of the data and then pass it on to data entry people to digitize the data into excel
Digitized data is later on analyzed and programs are designed / modified based on the analyzed data.
They also shared with us different forms available for different programs.
Overall the visit helped us understand their processes and data entry forms which in turn will aid us in further implementation using
Avni

==================================================

Setco ? project update
In continuation with the
previous blog
, here?s a quick update on
Avni
implementation for Setco project.
The project deliverable for Setco, consisted of
Maternal and child health
Child nutrition and development
Adolescent health
Preschool
Reports and
Importing of legacy data
Of the deliverables, so far we?ve been able to finish work on Maternal and child health program along with some loose ends that need to be tied up for Child nutrition and development.
With Avni, form designing for these programs was easy, but at the same time being new to Avni, the real challenge lied in how we applied the right rules. Avni supports a varied set of rules for different contexts like
Form validation
Skip logic
Ensuring correctness of data
Enrolling individuals to a program (e.g. only children of age 0-6 years can be enrolled for child development and nutrition program)
Scheduling visits and so on
These varied set of rules makes Avni, flexible enough to be used for any program implementation that involves data capture at various points in time. But as a na?ve Avni implementer understanding different rules, and implementing them correctly in Setco context, was at times overwhelming. However, quick calls with Avni team and responses to our queries over their gitter channel helped us make progress with the implementation.Title: Shaping & Leading the Implementation of Multiple mDiabetes Projects of Arogya World via Glific: Lessons Learned
Author: Priyesh Sikariwal
Date: February 2025
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/shaping-leading-the-implementation-of-multiple-mdiabetes-projects-of-arogya-world-via-glific-lessons-learned/
==================================================

Starting my journey of consulting at Project Tech4Dev with Arogya World’s projects has been an amazing learning experience. I had the opportunity to work on various aspects of its projects which focused on educating beneficiaries and encouraging them to manage their diabetic condition effectively. This was achieved through scheduled information and nudges on lifestyle changes—such as physical exercise, diet, stress management, etcetera—and by measuring the impact through baseline and endline assessments.
I could work on creation of contracts & addenda with clearly & responsibly defining deliverables, effort, and costs. Helping design flows like opt-ins, registrations, baseline/endline flows, other project-specific flows which was part of my role, along with use of HSMs, collections, expressions, triggers, G-Sheets and multiple Glific features, streamlining workflows. There were challenges, too—like urgent requests, time estimation issues, stakeholder alignment, and technical problems—which we tackled through improved communication and adjusting strategies.
Overview of Arogya World & its mDiabetes Program
Arogya World
is a
global health non-profit organization
working to prevent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through health education and lifestyle change. With their mission to spread awareness on healthy lifestyles, they’ve even run the world’s largest text/voice message-based diabetes prevention program:
mDiabetes
, reaching over a million Indians between 2011 and 2013.
Arogya World’s vision is to drive impactful change through digital health interventions. One of their key programs, mDiabetes, is designed to educate and gently nudge both healthy individuals and diabetic patients toward better habits. The program sends
56 to 62 personalized messages over six months
—
daily for initial weeks and then twice a week
—in
six languages
(English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu). These messages are delivered via the Glific chatbot that creates interactive flows, and the program’s effectiveness is measured through
baseline and endline surveys
.
Initially, messages were sent as SMS, but later the project transitioned to using the Glific platform, which allowed for more interactive, scheduled/automated, and targeted communication.
Projects’ Aspects I Worked On
During my time on the projects, I had the opportunity to work on several different aspects:
1. Contracts and Addenda Creation
:
I learned the importance of drafting contracts/addenda that clearly define the scope of work by breaking it into clear deliverables and accurately and responsibly estimating effort, cost, and required buffers for requirement gathering and feasibility checks, feedback incorporation and co-ordination. I learned the importance of meticulous reviewing and refining of contract/addenda language, along with a structured, deliverable-linked payment schedule.
2. Flow Creation and Dashboard Development:
I helped design and create flows for various stages, such as:
Opt-in flows
Registration flows
Baseline and Endline flows
Week 1/2 flows and Week 2/3 onwards flows
(using expressions/split by/flow-logics/triggers/collections/G-sheet etc.)
Opt-out flows
WhatsApp Group Flows
(using G-sheet)
3.
Message Content Approval:
We started by getting approval as HSMs for 62 messages for
both diabetic and healthy individuals
in all the required languages. Initially, we uploaded these messages in small chunks (about 10 at a time), which was time-consuming and required constant monitoring.
4. Process Improvements:
To streamline our work, we switched to using
Google Sheets
, which made it easier to manage and share the messages. I also learned the importance of clear naming conventions for flows, keywords, results, and variables. This made debugging easier and helped our developers create dashboards more efficiently.
Technical and Communication Challenges
Working on this project wasn’t without its challenges. Here are a few issues we faced and how we tackled them:
Handling Urgent Requests:
Urgent requests like conducting content revisions/flow revisions while staying on schedule for other deliverables required constant communication and flexibility.
Time Estimation Mismatches:
We sometimes underestimated the time needed for certain tasks. Learning to check the feasibility of requirements before committing to timelines was key.
Stakeholder Alignment:
Keeping everyone—from the product team, tech/dev team to external stakeholders—on the same page was challenging. We improved communication by ensuring that explanations, solutions, and queries were clearly laid out in our emails and meetings.
Technical Issues:
When our HSMs (marketing) were failing, we converted them to utility messages to ensure delivery.
We also had issues with triggers not working correctly due to calendar and system date mismatches. Adjusting the flow logic and refining testing processes resolved these problems.
Key Learnings
This project taught me a lot, both technically and in terms of project management:
1. Prioritizing Tasks:
Prioritizing tasks based on the team’s bandwidth dynamically and effectively communicating them can make a huge difference.
2. Structured Processes:
Establishing structured processes for handling urgent changes and feedback helps keep the project on track.
3. Effective Communication:
Clear email communication
,
actionable meetings
with
well-defined agendas
, discussions, and takeaways, along with
thorough explanations
and
proposed solutions
, are crucial.
4.
Testing and Approvals:
Pre-launch testing
and having
proper approval cycles
are essential to avoid post-launch fixes.
5.
Tracking and Ownership:
Maintaining
SLA tracking
and
detailed time logs
has improved our ability to manage consulting projects efficiently, and taking more ownership within the product team has streamlined our workflow.
6.
Managing Large-Scale Deployments:
Handling
multi-language, high-scale message distribution
requires
structured content management
and
flow design
.
7. Leveraging an Eye for Detail:
Ensuring
accuracy in content approvals, bot flows, and message deliveries
at such scale becomes non-negotiable.
8.
Collaborating Across Teams:
Working with multiple stakeholders, from NGO teams, internal teams, external vendors to developers, and aligning goals and expectations effectively.
9. Refining Problem-Solving Skills:
Solving unexpected technical and operational challenges on the go while ensuring timely execution, of committed deliverables.
Conclusion
My first consulting assignment at Project Tech4Dev with Arogya World was a
steep learning curve
, but it also provided me with valuable insights into
digital health, process optimization, and multi-team collaboration
. The experience has taught me the importance of
clear communication, structured workflows, and continuous testing
, all of which are crucial for delivering scalable and impactful digital solutions. I am working on
testing guidelines
for future projects based on insights gained from this project.
I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on such a significant program and its projects and excited to apply these learnings to future challenges!Title: Short and Learning-Packed Sprint at Dehradun
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: September 2022
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/short-and-learning-packed-sprint-at-dehradun/
==================================================

At the Dehradun Tech4Dev sprint, I had the opportunity again to represent the Women In Tech program along with Arun Kadekodi. We got a chance to introduce the WIT program to many who joined Tech4Dev recently, and reflect on the learnings from the 1st cohort and share updates on the 2nd cohort.
The sprint kicked off to a great start already when I reconnected with
Arjun
and met Ashwin, and Arjuns friend Bharat at the Bangalore airport. Over the course of the sprint – conversations ensued, areas of passion, alignment emerged (sometimes misalignment too!) and by the time we packed our bags home, we had solid plans to meet/reconnect again, take forward the conversations, and either potentially start working with each other or at the very least, stay in touch to continue our exchange of knowledge and learnings ????
This blog is dedicated to the 8 people I met for the first time over the course of 1.5 – 2 days (depending on whether we were travelling together). It still blows my mind how we were able to connect at a fairly deep level in such a short span of time. As usual, morning walks, breakfast, lunch and dinner conversations were one of my favourite times to connect with people.
Nidhi Goyal
:
Nidhi was my roommate, so I got extra time with her before we dozed off to sleep every night and got a chance to pick her brain on things ranging from skill development, marketing and branding, culture in big companies vs small, to managing work life balance as a working mom. Her insights were super helpful and it was reassuring and exciting to see the parallels in our respective work areas.
Sebastian Leidig
:
While I didnt get too much time with Seb (and would have liked to, lets connect again!), I loved the clarity he brought in his presentation about Aam Digital. Very crisp, to-the-point, and he showed us a demo, which I feel is always an impactful way to showcase your work, especially in tech. The thing that amazed me the most was that we had 3 competing organisations (Samanvay, Aam Digital and Dhwani) under one roof talking about their work and sharing learnings with each other! While every product has its subtle differences, it was still lovely to see the open and collaborative nature of this consortium. It was also great to learn from Seb his thoughts on how best to learn programming.
Swapnil Agarwal
: Swapnils talk about Dhwanis work and his insights on how technology works differently in the social sector in comparison to mainstream, was an inspiration. His vast experience in the sector was evident from the depth of clarity in his talk. Here are some nuggets from his talk that stayed with me at a personal level:
His experience of doing a 2-month rural immersion program at NIRMA where you do nothing i.e. no reporting of outcomes of any sort
Getting paid to do projects but they never see the light of the day
How he feels they are more solution-oriented over product since they cat say no
How field workers have 5 apps on their phone which do the same thing
Their work on scraping data from MGNREGA MIS and building APIs for Bharat
How non-profits are more open to SAAS-based pricing models now
Arjav Chakravarti
:
Arjavs session on culture and values was super interesting for many reasons but the best part for me was pondering about the similarities and differences in how culture works in consortiums like Tech4Dev vs how it works at a standalone organisation. I also loved his moderating style and Im hoping to get some tips from him on the same so I could do a better job at it!
Vinod Rajasekaran
:
Tech4Dev 2.0 has 3 verticals- Platforms, Fractional CXO and WIT. In a span of 3-4 months, Vinod joined as a Fractional CXO, was able to identify a challenge that was a problem not just for the NGO he was working with, but across the sector – and thus conceptualise a platform and even start working on it! His insights on how the data industry is shaping up was a great learning, and Im hoping that when the time is right, we could work together on co-creating a curriculum for WIT in this space as well.
Kurund Jalmi
:
It was great to finally meet Kurund, who Id heard about for a long time as one of the core members of Tech4Dev 1.0, and hear about their origin story. Its always great to listen to a small teams journey on how they all started out and reminds us that we all start small and theres always a long way to go. Dinner conversations on the college education system in India, the joy of learning programming along with Arun, Siddhant, and Seb is something I cherished and will take away with me.
Ashwin Srinivasan
:
Ashwin and us had a lot of synergies right off the bat, and we got a chance to dig deeper into how we could potentially work together as well! Ashwin is also the one who introduced us to our newest partner Mahalakshmi from Ananya, and it was lovely to become a part of this small world of super passionate, amazing human beings who genuinely care and hopefully will also start working together very closely. Very excited to reconnect with Ashwin in Bangalore, introduce him to our team and take things forward!
Ankit Saxena
:
Despite the short amount of time we spent with each other, I was extremely happy to have connected with Ankit, shared my story and the why behind our work. It was immensely reassuring and morale-boosting to have him connect so deeply to the philosophy were working with, as someone who had experienced it himself. Im hoping to stay connected, loop him into our work and do amazing things together! Special thanks to Kurund, Vinod, Ankit and Ashwin for spending that extra 30 mins and listening to me deep-dive into the WIT program (which I learnt in hindsight that I should have done earlier). Your insights and specific suggestions were extremely helpful and will ensure that we make our program better and take it to the next level.
Overall, it was a privilege to be part of a group where everyone around me was somebody to look up to, and Im taking away a lot of learnings and fun memories back with me.
Special kudos and gratitude to Erica Arya, Sanchita and the MiceKart team for managing the logistics and making sure everything went by so smoothly. Until next time!

My takeaways from Tech4Dev Conference, where I shared space with folks working towards Social Impact using technology in Tehri, Uttarakhand 🙂
View from the ColoredCow Office
Co-working with like-minded people
One of the hardest things for an extrovert like me during the pandemic was working in isolation. Tehri reminded me of what seems like a million years ago when I had the luxury of working around people. Like meeting a dear friend after a gap. A seemingly abnormal normalcy in todays times. Right away I felt at home.
A snap of all of us on our trek to the top of the hill 🙂
I learned a lot!
Learning about problems and, more importantly solutions to said problems that folks from various organisations were working on, I was fascinated and inspired by the depth of knowledge that had gathered there.
Sessions were in the form of
TechTalks
and
DeepDives.
In TechTalks, folks from their respective organisation talked about the project they are working on and in DeepDives individuals would conduct learning sessions around a topic thats useful for many like PWA and its challenges.
Simon from Aam Digital talked about PWA, its implementations and challenges
As a designer, learning about the application of development concepts I had only read about has only served to pique my interest further. With folks with years of experience talking about how they inculcated an OSS model, something we at Ooloi have long wanted to do, provided me with insight on how we can approach this.
Being surrounded by nature
The natural beauty, New Tehri, is located amidst the backdrop of the snow-covered mountains with the lake at the centre. It seemed like a perfect destination for a sprint like this.
The conference was a fine balance of work and play. Working from ColoredCows beautiful offices situated up the hill from our EcoHuts on the lake was lovely.
Jogging track next to the lake
Eco Hut
Being a morning person, starting my days off with a brisk stroll and running around the lake, I couldnt have asked for a more gorgeous start to my day. We even managed a group meditation one morning!
Not only were we working hard during the day, due to the well-structured plan set up by Tech4Dev, but I also had the opportunity of seeing beautiful snow-capped mountains on a trek dotted with pine and cherry blossom trees.
Monkeys on Pine Trees
Cherry Blossom Trees
The work culture at ColoredCow
From day one of us arriving at Tehri to the day we left, we were taken care of by the ColoredCow Team.
Prateek Narang
(Founder of ColoredCow) has managed to build an environment where people like coming to work.
ColoredCow Office has a library where people can borrow books, Muji stationery (for people like me :)), craft papers, musical instruments, dartboard and many more things to play around with. They also keep cycles and kick scooters to get some physical activity going!
ColoredCows Library with Neon Logo
Tech4Dev Conference in Tehri promised and delivered not just on the beautiful landscape but also of interacting with like-minded individuals whom I hope to stay in touch with and the learnings which I will surely share with my team.Title: Spandan

==================================================

MB Baravalia Foundation?s
Spandan
holistic mother and child care hospital is one of the
organisations selected in the current cohort
of Tech4Dev projects.
In their application Spandan identified following projects where currently data is collected manually and IT systems are required to help record, track, retrieve, analyse and evaluate data.
Spandan holistic mother and child care hospital
Spandan outreach projects
Tech4Dev identified Samanvay to work with Spandan. At Samanvay, we decided to visit their place of work in Mumbai to understand the requirements in detail.
We visited Spandan 15th to 18th of February for the visit. The dates were suggested by Spandan such that we could also see a mental health checkup camp by Spandan on 18th.
We covered the following as per pre decided agenda
15th (Friday) – Understanding Hospital operations, IT system requirements and solution discussion
16th (Saturday) – Understanding outreach projects work, IT system requirements
17th (Sunday) – Attending medical camp, cover whatever is pending and discuss on plan on way forward
Hospital
On 15th we first had walkthrough of the
hospital
in Govandi. The hospital currently runs a homeopathy OPD and has maternity ward. The OPD sees on an average 50-70 patients and the team their expects it to rise to 120-150 by year end. The OPD has a typical workflow of registration, doctors consultation, diagnostics if required, doctors second consultation with prescription and drug dispensing from pharmacy, in this order.
The hospital has a maternity ward and also has operation theatres where currently only minor procedures are performed, however they are soon set to start with complex ones like neurosurgery. After having a walkthrough of hospital, we then had a look at different registers being maintained and checklists used for screening. There are about 10 – 15 checklists, many of them requiring the doctor to manually calculate scores. Apart from ease of data maintenance and retrieval, automatic calculation of scores was one clear benefit identified from digitising these checklists.
We then demonstrated
Bahmni
to Dr Praful Barvalia, the founder, trustee and Chairman of the Barvalia foundation, and his team showcasing mainly registration, clinical, lab, billing and pharmacy parts. The team liked the software. During the demo, the drug prescription brought up a discussion of how homeopathy drug prescription format is different from modern medicine. We have to look at how the homeopathy drug prescription can be modeled in openmrs / Bahmni data model, which has so far been mainly used for modern medicine (Allopathy).
Spandan Outreach projects
On 16th we visited Dr Barvalia?s private clinic in Ghatkopar where he walked us through various initiatives they do part of the
outreach projects
. As part of the outreach project, Spandan primarily works in the nearby slums conducting health camps, screening, deaddiction drives periodically. The outreach project has evolved and seen various phases. Currently the initiatives are conducted on project basis but plan are there to make it more structured with regular activities implementing via a pyramid model of health workers comprising of volunteers, supervisors, doctors and specialists. Dr Barvalia mentioned that they have plans to make this operational by this year end.
We demonstrated
OpenCHS
app which could be used by field workers as a job aid application utilising features like dynamic forms and decision support. Dr Barvalia liked the app and felt that it could be used in both outreach projects as well as hospital.
Medical camp
On 17th we attended a
free child care camp for children with disability and mental health problems
organised at the hospital by Barvalia foundation. About 100 children and their parents attended the camp. The camp comprised of screening by homeopathy doctors, triaging and then consultations with specialists like speech therapist, psychotherapist, psychiatrist, neurologist, opthalmic surgeon, paediatrician, paediatric surgeon, paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, plastic surgeon, special educators, dietician and more.
After the camp, Dr Barvalia walked us through different formats of data being maintained in physical registers and an access based system, which he himself developed by reading up books and taking voluntary help. We discussed around the needs based on our observation and prioritisation. Following priority order was agreed based on urgency of need and how structured the operations
Hospital (now)
Outreach projects (when the program becomes more structured)
Medical camp (for sometime later.)
Mapping the Requirements and existing Open-source products
Bahmni comes very close to meeting the requirements for the hospital. Dr Praful Barvalia felt OpenCHS and its decision support system and counselling features can also be used in the hospital settings. OpenCHS can also meet the need of the Outreach projects but that has to be evaluated when the program becomes more structured and needs more clear.
Dr Praful Barvalia also expressed a need and wish for an app for the Medical camp. We felt that OpenCHS or any existing product would not be able help for the camp which has a heavy workload, untrained users (volunteers), informal workflow and chaotic settings. It?s very difficult for a app based solution, especially using a generic product, to be practicable in settings like this. We discussed that this would require detailed articulation of need, an app tailored for the settings and use-cases. As this is not high priority, so this can be approached subsequently when IT needs in hospital and outreach areas have been catered to. This was agreeable to him.
Next Steps
We shared documentation on Bahmni and OpenCHS with Spandan.
Dr Barvalia and Spandan team to compile and provide us detailed requirements so that we finalise the scope and timelines in next couple of weeks and start the work.
On a personal note from the visit, the sight of so many children with mental health issues that too in Mumbai was very depressing and stayed back with me. But on the other hand, it was uplifting to see Spandan team and especially Dr Praful Barvalia?s work powered by their compassion and hardwork.
We with Dr. Praful Barvalia
Looking forward to help them with their IT needs.Title: Spring Sprint at Glific

==================================================

It’s soon going to be 2 years of building Glific. So far we’re going strong with a good partnership from the NGOs – our main users of the product. We are in touch with many of them on a daily basis through our communication channels. However, once in a while we bring down the virtual walls to meet and work in-person. Like this last
Glific sprint that happened in Tehri
in November between Tech4Dev, Glific Team, ColoredCow and 12 NGOs. It was a great experience for the Glific team to get to know the work done by some of the great NGOs in impact space. Continuing the same spirit, the Glific team planned to hang out in Mumbai between Feb 28 and Mar 6 for another sprint. This one is at a slightly smaller scale than the previous one, but carries the same ethos as before.
Sprint planning
A few weeks before the sprint was finalised, we invited our NGO partners to work together with us pro bono. Atleast the ones in Mumbai(and nearby areas) could join in. The only requirement for them was to plan what they wanted to work on with us. We asked for a detailed and actionable requirement doc so that we knock off some tasks and have a productive time together. And that the requirements should likely be generic enough to impact most users. A few NGOs showed interest. So we started planning our week
here
. It was a mix of working together, just meeting with people and hanging out in Mumbai with some
nice recommendations from Lobo
.
Landing in Mumbai on Sunday. Glific team gearing up for the week ahead. People not in the picture are Vivek, Mohit, Lobo.
We all huddled up on Sunday evening to look at the calendar again and plan for the week. We had assigned who from the team would work with whom.
Structure for the week
We had 1-2 NGOs planned to visit us everyday with
Bandhu
– working on sms triggers and flows optimisation
Mukkamaar
– brainstorming ideas for more engagement and creating contextual nudge messages
SlamOutLoud
– planning for a new program launch,
along with visits from
SoftCorner
– for their help with business development for Glific
Hyperverge academy
– sharing more about the women in tech program
A few highlights from the week so far:
Working with Jacob from the Bandhu team and learning a lot more about their application stack, the problems they are trying to solve and how Glific fits in their solution. We got quite a comprehensive presentation from Jacob on day 1.
We had already been interacting with Ishita from the Mukkamaar team regarding their programs. They are doing great work with scrutinising the impact of their programs by creating detailed reports and questioning the engagement. We are trying to help in these two areas to gear up for program launch at scale.
Hyperverge, Tech4Dev and ColoredCow have also been working on Women In Tech program that trains female college students for software jobs. It was nice reconnecting and catching up on it with Gayathri Meka.
Day 3 brought together Drashti from the SlamOutLoud team who had also shared with us some specific items to work on. We were able to discuss beforehand to clarify the requirements and approach.
All the interactions with NGOs were quite productive as per our feedback from them. It was efficient, engaging, and informative.
We were also visited by Ranjana from SoftCorner who is going to be helping us out with outreach for Glific. We want to be able to reach out to more NGOs and help them with their program through the chatbot. We built a good connection with Ranjana and we’re looking forward to a great collaboration.
We’re also keeping our sprint healthy and fun with morning walks out for breakfast or filter coffee or just workout in the park. We’re graced with really tasty food from Lobo’s family too.
We still have a couple of days to go. We will edit it further to add more adventures and experiences from the sprint.Title: Spring Sprint with Mukkamaar

==================================================

After the Covid crisis intensified, everyone was being pushed into tight corners and was still adjusting to the new norm of working remotely. Thus working together in a cohesive environment, jotting down ideas, and discussing work plans felt like a distant memory.
However, as the situation in India has begun to improve, we decided to host a spring sprint in Mumbai from February 28 to March 6, 2022, with the goal of interacting with and working with our NGO partners in person.
A few weeks before the sprint started, we requested our NGO partners to collaborate with us to knock off a few items off their Chatbot’s list of future plans
For the second and third day of the Sprint, we were joined by
Mukkamaar
, a non-profit organization committed to ensuring that girls can connect with something that empowers them not just physically, but also emotionally and psychologically through their programs.
They’ve been using
Glific
for over a year and began their pre-pilot in November 2021 with 50 individuals from several schools in three languages:
Hindi
,
English
, and
Marathi
. Then, in February 2022, they conducted another controlled pilot to assess the user experience with the bot, including how actively they interact, how well they grasp the content, and where they get stuck.
After these two pilots, they are planning significant changes in their chatbot which includes setting up contextual nudge messages and  to brainstorm ideas around rephrasing the content of the message, changing overall structure, and many more things for better overall engagement with the chatbot
Brainstorming Sessions
There were long conversations with Mukkamaar about how we could better reach contacts through WhatsApp and how gamification may aid in maintaining continual engagement with the bot. Rewarding points for each successful activity, daily bonuses, redeeming points for mobile recharge, and keeping track of a leaderboard are all small pieces of a larger puzzle to keep people engaged.
After a few hours of discussion, we realized that although keeping a leaderboard might be motivating for those at the top, it can also be demoralizing for those who are left behind.
The solution, motivating them even more by fostering in them a sense of community and the importance of everyone’s contribution, no matter how tiny, to the larger good
Instead of a leaderboard, it made more sense to display the total score based on everyone’s contributions, encouraging people to contribute more so that the community could progress.
Setting up Nudge Message
As Mukkamaar s chatbot program mainly focuses on girls in the age group of 11-14 years,  most of the girls interact with the bot with their parents mobile phones, which limits the interaction between the bot and these girls.
This oftentimes led to conversations being left out once mobile devices are no longer accessible or their parents are out of the home.
Through this sprint, As we worked closely with Mukkamaar we had finalized nudge messages and created webhooks to send out messages to contacts that are stuck in the middle of conversations. Moreover, to increase the odds of receiving a response, these messages will be delivered on a regular basis during the hours when most parents are at home.
These nudge messages are also modified by gamifying the conversation to keep it interesting. As a result, anytime someone completes a task, they are awarded points, which can then be redeemed for mobile recharges.
As Mukkamaar works to improve their chatbot for overall engagement, this Sprint enabled us to go the additional mile with them and advance their chatbot a few steps in the long run of empowering young girls through emotional and physical training via ChatbotTitle: Sprint Behind the scenes

Written by Akhilesh from ColoredCow and Glific team.
Prologue
It all started when Donald Lobo announced his visit to India after the COVID situation in India had started to settle in and finally meet Team ColoredCow in their Gurgaon office in person after having worked on an open-source project named Glific for a year and a half together remotely. At that time Tehri Social Impact Sprint was still an idea when at the dinner table Lobo proposed it to Prateek Narang, CEO, and Founder of ColoredCow who agreed with open arms to host the event in their office at Tehri.
With the official
announcement
of the sprint through
the CHINTU GUDIYA FOUNDATION
blog post, Tehri Social Impact Sprint started molding into a reality with the goal to work in a collaborative environment for week-long making progress on their respective projects with their team, learning from each others work, sharing problems, challenges and learning with each other and potential collaborations.
Collecting the dots
Hosting Social Impact Sprint was a mammoth task as soon the ColoredCow Tehri office would be four-time its usual occupancy in a short period. Organizing an event is simple and complicated at the same time. It usually requires doing all the things that we do usually, but on a larger scale. Like our kitchen regularly serves meals for 15 people usually, with the event we had to serve for 45. We usually travel to Tehri in a car, with the event we needed two additional vans!
To bring all this together, we started about a month back. We used simple excels to plan and keep track of our priorities. Tasks were distributed to individuals based on their skills and interests and wherever needed others pitched in and made it all work with Tushar being the lead organizer and the facilitator for the event.
Accommodation and Hospitality
Accommodation in Eco huts and THDC guest house with a window view of the beautiful lake was taken care of by Tushar, Vivek, and Shamoon.
A thorough inspection of everything a week before, ensuring everyone reached their home safely and comfortably along with surprising Sebastian on his birthday with a cake, everything went so smoothly.
Arrival
On Sunday, Nov 14, the day started with Tushar leaving at 6 am in the chilly morning of Tehri to welcome guests at Dehradun Airport, while the rest of the team started preparations for welcoming them in Tehri
With 35 people from 12 organizations(ColoredCow, Dost Education, Reap Benefit, Rainmatter Foundation, Aam Digital, Avanti Fellows, Dhwani RIS, Glific, Ooloi Labs, Shelter Associates, Soft Corner, and IDInsight ) gathered together from across the globe, Tehri Sprint began.
Delicious food in nice candlelight made the 4hr hill drive from Dehradun to Tehri totally worth it
Food
Food has been the highlight of the sprint, with a menu full of food items from across India like Dosa, Poha, Halwa, Palak Paneer, Rajma Chawal, and regional delicacies per the week-long plan of the food items handpicked by Satendra and Kuldeep.
Though Food has been taken care of by Prakashji and Sunitaji at the Tehri office but as serving food 3 times a day along with evening and morning tea starting at 7 am was a humongous task, we felt that we will be needing all the help we can get.
So, Saurabh(Lead Chef at Gurgaon Office) joined the Tehri office and stayed in the office with Prakashji for a week.
With 3 great Chefs at Tehri office, Great food was a sure guarantee but every great food requires fresh ingredients which required frequent visits to grocery shops, often 3-4 times a day by Akhilesh and Mohd Shamoon on daily basis starting at 7:30 am
One fine evening there was an authentic South-Indian feast made by Gautam Rajesh.
Every food is incomplete without the story behind it, Thanks to PK and his amazing memory who shared the background, the ingredients used, and the recipe of each food.
Tech Talks and Deep dives
With organizations working together for a week, Tech talks and Deep dives were a great place to know more about the organizations, their work, and the impact they are creating on the social sector.
It was great knowing how everyone is helping in the social sector and helping NGOs transform the lives of their beneficiaries.
Before each event, a lot of efforts were made by Gaurav and Kuldeep to test the microphones, speakers, TVs for presentation and ensure voice and video quality of the meeting for the people who are joining virtually.
Story Club
Appreciation and praise are something everyone seeks from others in their work, but oftentimes the art is appreciated and the story behind the art, the journey of the artist remains unsung.
Story Club is a weekly open-mic event initiated by ColoredCow which invites these unsung heroes to share their stories about the work they are doing and how it’s impacting the lives of so many people around the world.
In the Social Sprint, Story Club was hosted by Akhilesh where Gautam, Jyoti, and Hitesh shared their story about their journey in ColoredCow.
Followed by Sheneille, Lobo, Aman, Deepansh, Abhay, Sebastian.
Trek
The climb may be tough but the view from the top is always better…
So on Thursday, we planned a 6 km uphill trek from the ColoredCow Office to a beautiful cafe (Auli Chai) in the Town of New Tehri with Akhilesh and Shamoon leading the group.
Shamoon led the people by giving false hopes of reaching there in 5 minutes whenever someone asks- how much further to go so that people will not lose motivation.
There was Red Bull for people who couldn’t walk anymore so they could fly there.
Party
One could say every day was a party there in a way but still, we planned one day for a barbeque night by the lake.
The preparations started at 6 pm, two hours ahead of the party schedule by Satendra, Vivek, Mohit, Gaurav, PK, Kuldeep, and the rest of the team at ColoredCow who set up the stage and instruments, getting the lights, starting the bonfire, and bringing the place to life by creating an atmosphere of music and sharing.
Food preparation was taken care of by Prakash and Saurab with Kuldeep assisting them in paneer tikkas.
PK, Vaibhav, and Prateek started the Karaoke night and everyone started jamming with them. People sang their favorite songs and melodies under starry night by the lake enjoying great food and drinks. The warmth of the atmosphere and people surely overwhelmed the chilly night…
The party had a drinks bar with a wide variety of alcoholic beverages and cool drinks. This bar was taken care of by Gautam Rajesh and Gautam Prakash. They helped everyone and even recommended drinks according to each persons taste.
Great drinks, delicious food, and beautiful music are surely the basic ingredients of a truly memorable evening. We end the party at midnight and let everyone save energy for Friday, the last of the trip.
Promise to meet Again
On the last day, it was like a reminiscence of the entire week with the promise to meet again soon. Looking forward to the next announcement dates
Although it was a hectic week, there were smiling faces all around.Title: Sprint Experience in the first week of work

==================================================

I am writing this to share my first week experience joining Tech4Dev. I feel I was lucky to have my joining date coincide with the very week of the Kochi sprint which gave me the opportunity to really get a feel for the spirit of the team and the culture.
I had met Lobo, Erica, Vinod, Rohit, Rajeev for discussions in the previous month but was meeting most of the other team members for the first time. This was also the week where two events – the Data Catalyst program and the LLM cohort, were being held at the venue. This made the week very exciting as well as overwhelming at the same time.
The Data catalyst program, driven by Dasra, brought in the 12 handpicked NGOs and partners like Goalkeep and AgencyFund whereas the LLM cohort was conducted in partnership with Agency Fund. For someone like me being new to the sector, this was the best opportunity to meet the Dasra team, Agency Fund, Goalkeep and a set of NGOs , all in one place and understand how they are aligned within the ecosystem.
Data Catalyst program was aimed towards building a strong data culture within the nonprofit organizations, to help them assess the transformational impact with the vulnerable communities through their programs/interventions. The program was structured well with a combination of insightful sessions on data leadership, data literacy and working sessions. The program began with short introductions from each of the NGO teams and their purpose in attending the program. This was a bunch of folks, passionate about their work, with an excitement to learn and eager to share their learnings and challenges with the fellow NGOs. At the end of the program each of the NGO team was expected to come up with a problem statement, which they would work over the period of next 3 months with the help of the DCP PoCs. I was working with the Ummeed team as a POC. Ummeed works with the children with special needs, to help them achieve their potential.
I also had the chance to mingle with the other NGO representatives during course of the program. I saw a lot of interesting work happening on the ground, be it womens health issues, mental health and wellbeing, childrens education, empowerment. Got to see the application/app demos from some of them like Saajha, ILP, Bandhu. All in all, most of them were seeking solutions for data management and impact assessment.
Several discussions followed relating to Dalgo and the fCXO work. This was also the time to interact with a bunch of young enthusiastic members of the team, some quiet, some chirpy but equally excited about their work and with a drive to learn new stuff. There were deep dive sessions on openAI and LLM from the Agency Fund team.
While all the work was happening diligently, Lobo was also keeping the team motivated on their fitness levels, with the customary morning walks. Though it was very early for me, I tried to join the fitness cohort on one of the days. Not too far from the main highway, the route led into the lush green fields and was truly refreshing. This being the world cup season, team got together to cheer for the cricket team later in the evenings. And of course there were celebrations for the Data Catalyst program and the sprint with some karaoke and fun games.
To sum it up, it was the team coming together with a purpose and a dash of fun…an essential potion for teams that work remotely.Title: Sprinting Through Kenya: Collaboration, Learning, and Wildlife wonders

People who know me well at work also know that I procrastinate when it comes to writing. I think it’s because I often struggle to find the right words (See! Even here, the word “articulation” didn’t come to my mind first). But this is the blog that I really felt like writing because I don’t want the conversations I’ve had or the things I’ve learned in the last two days to fade from memory ever!
To give some context, we (
Project Tech4Dev
) &
The Agency Fund
(TAF) co-hosted a sprint at Naivasha, Kenya. The aim was to bring together organizations tackling different issues, enable cross learnings and create a strong community of learning and collaboration. I, along with four other team members, had the opportunity to attend.
We’ve been conducting sprints for the past couple of years in India, and I’ve always been excited for them. They give me a chance to meet passionate people, hear exciting ideas, and learn from experiments and experiences (Read
my last blog
on the Goa sprint experience). So, when Lobo asked if I’d be interested in joining the sprint in Kenya, I was more than happy. I was curious to learn how the NGO landscape in Kenya/East Africa is, what the similarities and differences are compared to India.
Over the past two days, through multiple sessions (amazingly designed & hosted by TAF), lightning talks, dinner table conversations, and outings, I had the chance to engage with people from diverse nations, educational backgrounds, and professions (designers, behavior scientists, data scientists, developers, academia, program & product managers, founders- Wow!). They’re all working on addressing various challenging issues faced by less privileged communities, such as maternal & child healthcare, mental health of youth & LGBTQ+ community, and education. Each conversation and session gave me valuable insights. Every conversation and session left me with some learnings & thoughts – but here are a few that will stay with me for a longer time.
Kenya & India share so many cultural similarities hospitality, norms around gender inequality, the education system, stigma around mental health, etc. I never realized that 2 countries from 2 completely different continents could have so much in common. How can NGOs learn more from each other while designing models?
The
Shamiri team
(Rahim & Shadrack) shared the “4 enoughs approach,” which they follow when creating dashboards, strategies, or models to ensure scalability GOOD ENOUGH (sufficient impact to matter), BIG ENOUGH (adequate scope given the problem’s scale), SIMPLE ENOUGH (for easy replication by other organizations), CHEAP ENOUGH (affordable at scale to sustain the model)- This is something that I am going to keep asking myself whenever I am designing something.
All NGOs are facing challenges related to Data (be it data collection, cleanup, drawing actionable insights, correlating with impact, and building data culture). We need to collectively solve the problem by creating/sharing more common resources, learnings, best practices and tools which might solve the problem to some level.
Leah Mwai from
Shujaaz
& I had an interesting conversation, where she passionately spoke about how the education system often asks us to choose between the left & right brain, but does not encourage all of us to use both to solve problems creatively yet rationally. She spoke about how it is important in NGO sector to have team members from varied sectors to strike a balance between implementation & taking a scientific/research approach to solve problems at scale.
She also shared her idea on involving university research scientists/students in local NGOs for their Ph.D. projects, benefiting both parties (University students – to find projects where there is a lot of scope to research and NGOs who will get scientific minds on board who understand local context & culture). And this will also help to build a stronger ecosystem. I feel this is a powerful idea worth exploring.
One question has been my dilemma for years: If scaling programs compromises impact, should NGOs even scale? Why not focus on achieving a significant impact with smaller groups? While I understand the breadth of the problem, I’ve never gotten a satisfactory answer from any of my discussions. I had brought this up with Lobo as well, and he said, See, many NGOs have shown us how we can effectively solve the problem in comparatively smaller groups. But none of us know how to solve it at scale – hence right now it might look like we aren’t impacting or we are just experimenting. But if we don’t do those experiments now, the problem will multiply so many times that we won’t even be able to have money, human resources to experiment at that scale. I am not sure if it’s the person who told it & the way it was told made the impact- As I connect the dots based on my experience, I think I now understand the importance of scaling, experimenting, and learning from failure better than before.
This sprint reinforced in me the importance of bringing people together to share their work, learnings, experiences, and failures. Based on conversations I had or the presentations I heard, I realized that there is so much in common that can be shared with each other, without the need to reinvent (or minimize) the wheel. How can we make that happen? What will it take for all of us to do that?
Last but not least, Kenya’s nature, wildlife, and beauty have been a HUGE highlight. The nature walk to Lake Naivasha, outing to Crescent Island with the whole group, and the beautiful stay will be remembered forever.

==================================================

This blog was written by
Apurva Srivastav from Dasra
Good team sprints are meant to be full of reviews, roadmaps, and hackathons, however the great ones are also full of food, games, and stories. I found it is a brilliant idea that Tech4Dev does sprints at a location that people want to travel to. It makes the event aspirational so everyone comes prepared, enjoyable so the team stays engaged, and greatly improves the recall value of just about every conversation you have during the sprint. It’s much easier to tell your teammate later- “Remember that idea I told you after the walk at Ward’s lake”, than it is to say “Remember the zoom call on 24th Oct….” You get the drift 🙂
Side Note: I am glad that one of the ideas (regarding AI for the sector) which got deliberated at length over a Meghalese lunch during this sprint is soon getting tested via a pilot launch in Jan ’25. More on that in the next blog, perhaps.
In October’ 24, I had the chance to attend Tech4Dev’s quarterly team spring in Shillong. It was my first sprint with the Project Tech4Dev team. It was insightful to get a deeper experience of the platforms, processes, and people, as Dasra and Tech4Dev stay close partners always looking to complement each other’s strengths. While I had met some of the T4D leaders and team members earlier, at Dasra in Mumbai or at the Philanthropy forums in NYC, the majority of the 35-member team I came to know directly in Shillong and from the onset their energy was simply infectious. Almost everyone seemed to have a natural flair for organizing, hosting, and entertaining, be it for 3YP vision exercises or party games. It seems like an unsaid hiring criteria and surely made everything more fun. (Kudos to Radhika, Ashwin, Gautam, Tejas, Nishika, and many others who planned this sprint’s events)
Here are some of the key observations that have stayed with me 2 months post the event. Yes, there is a good reason for the delay on this blog
The team that hikes together, strikes together!
This could be the Tech4Dev contextualized version of the saying ‘the team that plays together slays together’. Almost every morning, folks went for a morning jog, walk, hike, or some sorts. I don’t know who in the team has created the record for most hikes done before-during-after a single quarterly sprint but my money is on Lobo and Vinod. I joined for 2 of the 5 days and I was quite happy about that success rate. I still am, considering the end of the sprint (more on that later). We even shot a dance reel on the hike to Laitlum Canyon where the team’s rhythm was tested. After a few test runs, the production shot was on
point
beat 🙂
Compete to win, but give others a hand when you can!
There is something about hackathons- adrenaline, creativity, caffeine (more on that later), snacks, and ofcourse the anticipation that adds life to the sprint. This time there were 10 unique problem statements which teams of 2-4 members worked on. The common thread was leveraging data to improve decision making, process efficiency, and/or NGO user experience. Expectedly, AI and LLMs made an appearance in most of the projects. There was a fair amount of competition between teams as it should be, but it was also wholesome to see a general willingness to point others in the right direction when it came to finding solutions to common challenges. Also, it didn’t hurt that the team I was a part of
D3- Data Dialogue Decision
(thanks Devi, Ashwin, and Poorva) won the prize for high-impact. I am expecting some coupon, or certificate, or something to reach me any day now 😛
Good Leaders eat last (according to management books) but they will likely finish the good coffee first 😛
The culturally diverse team discovered a few strong differences of opinions on crucial topics such as vegetable to water ratio of an ideal sambhar, however we stayed united in our common love for good coffee. From giving nuanced feedback to the hotel staff on their filter coffee to making freshly brewed french press for the post lunch sessions- leaders led the foray here too. Caffeine fueled the deep discussions in Dalgo and Gliffic visioning workshops and we practiced staying with the questions more deeply, rather than jumping to potential answers right away.
Some answers will take more than a few sprints!
My favourite question of the sprint stays- “How do you define impact?”. We deep dived on the meaning of established metrics such as ‘lives impacted’ and what role Tech4dev plays when working with the NGOs. How do we weigh access to insights, time to decisions, efficiency of scale, and which ones are better to prioritize in what contexts? I encourage anyone reading this blog to also share with us their version of the answer in the comments; because this is not a question we answered with certainty during this sprint, and will surely keep revisiting in the upcoming ones.
Remember the Why- spend time knowing the people you want to impact
To ensure that the blue-sky thinking of product vision sessions or the high optimism from the hackathon triumphs didn’t get to our heads, and that we stayed true to the needs of our users- we ended the sprint with an in-person meet of 30+ NGOs in the north east. We reflected on localized solutions, multi-stakeholder collaborations, and above all the need for visibility to the work of NGOs and communities in the north-eastern states. Many of these NGOs are grassroots organizations that have recently joined forces with Dasra.org and Tech4Dev or are exploring support from either of our two teams to do more.
Be careful of snags right before completion
All good things must come to a conclusion and so did the week long sprint, with a spare day planned for some sight seeing and more hikes, of course. Unfortunately, I hit a snag on Friday eve when a slip and fall led me to break my ankle (bone and ligaments inclusive). Being within a team that actively hikes and plays sports came in quite handy- the quick thinking emergency response was commendable (shout out to Ashwin, Antony, Abhishek, Thomas and so many more) and so was the support of everyone who tried to keep me entertained on the last day 🙂
All in all, the sprint was thought-provoking (workshops, hackathon, and NGO meets), productive (reviews, hackathon, and goal setting), as well as enjoyable (hackathon, team building, catch-ups). Yes, the hackathon did break a leg (pun intended) in all 3 categories! And yes, my road to recovery although long and tedious is thankfully on-track 🙏
All the best for the next sprint, team. Stay intact!Title: Sprinting forward in the data journey

Goa Sprint January2024
Just back from a weeklong sprint in Goa. It has been an eventful week with NGO meets, Data Catalyst Program(DCP), Glific Sprint all happening alongside. We began the Sprint with our quarterly reviews followed by Chai pe charcha(Goa NGOs meet) and then the Glific/DCP cohort. There was also some room for fun with the Techie for dev awards and team building activity and the morning walks.
The DCP cohort1 began in the last Sprint in Kochi in October 2023, where the 12 participant NGOs decided on their problem statement and the 3 month action plan. During the last Sprint, teams spent a lot of time finalising their problem statement, going back and forth. It seemed a bit skeptic that they would be able to action out the plan but I was pleasantly surprised with the progress made between the two sprints by most of them.
I was the (S)POC for Ummeed and they zeroed in on measuring the intensity of engagement with every child registered with their organisation. This exercise was a step towards measuring impact on each child, connections they built, to ensure they are socially compatible. While the team (Pervez, Amolika, Vinodhini) had debates on the formulation of the problem statement, they were swift in actioning it out, working with the internal stakeholders on validating it and then identifying a cohort of 100 children for their study. During this exercise, they were able to identify the data quality needs and tools needed for consolidation of the necessary data points to carry forward their analysis.
We also had a few sessions planned for the audience by Dasra, Goalkeep and Tech4Dev teams. I was a co-presenter along with my colleague Rohit Chatterjee for a couple of sessions on Data Governance and Data explorations using AI. Since we started working on these sessions pretty late in the cycle, we had to spend time in finalising our charts and reviews during the initial days of the Sprint, missing out on the Sunday beach trip 🙁
For the Governance session, we chose the topic of data sharing within and external to the org. There were some role plays that we decided on, and there were interesting set of discussions/questions across the room. Data exploration session was very well taken by all. For this we decided to explore Julius AI along with a couple of datasets, namely, covid and diabetes. All teams enthusiastically explored the data analysis, carefully drafting their prompts, trying to play around with the complexity and some even tried getting deep into the code. And we had discussions on their findings.
The room was a mix of tech, M&E, founders, leaders and each of them brought in a different perspective to the discussions in general. The M&E or the tech teams within the NGOs have a limited headcount and hence do not get opportunities for discussions on the topic of their interest or expertise within their org. And they are short of bandwidth when comes to exploring new tools, technologies etc. Programs like DCP give them an opportunity to be a part of the wider ecosystem, where they get to share, discuss, question and broaden their reach. Also, the NGO presentations were an excellent example of how DCP could accelerate some of the long standing investigations or analysis that could have otherwise been on the back burner.
We definitely need to continue these ecosystem building programs and continue the journey with them, for them. Together we succeed in bringing the change.Title: Sprinting with Technology, Connecting Minds, Connecting Lives

Toshal Gandhi
I landed in Udaipur the evening after a long connecting flight from Pune. I was already added to a whatsapp group a couple of days ago. The group had a bunch of random people, is what I thought in the beginning. How strange, I thought, why would they make a group of random participants of a Sprint. I didnt even know what a sprint means. I met two girls at the  airport, we shared a cab to the resort where this was being held. With my perpetually curious mind, I kept on asking them questions about what they do, how they use Tech4Dev products. They must have hated me for it, however, they patiently answered all the questions and also started making plans of visiting places in Udaipur. Thats where I felt a connection.
Connection is an ambiguous word, isnt it? Its been used abundantly in the technology space, in its literal sense. And then, we use it to define something very ambiguous, very subjective, the human bond. If you ask 10 people about human connection, they will all probably answer differently. But, the sense of warmth, the sense of togetherness might be common. Thats what I felt throughout the two and half days of my time at the Tech4Dev Sprint.
What I visualised of a sprint before going was a lot like techies running around, daydreaming and cracking the code, almost like in the movies (This is just me living in a fantasy land). It was anything but that. It was the most calm yet productive work event I have ever been to. The conversations throughout the Sprint made an introvert like me find a new comfort zone of being extroverted. Well, thats something, since this has only happened twice or thrice in the past 30 years of my life.
Getting to why I was here. I work at
Dasra
, under the Philanthropy Labs team. As the name suggests, we work on building ideas, ideas that have the potential to create social impact on an ecosystem level in the Indian Development Sector, ideas that accelerate the power of philanthropy. I was in Udaipur to work on another idea, an idea to build capacity for individuals to leverage the power of data in their organisations. I was told to observe, grasp, and let the thoughts brew. Thats like a dream for a thinker personality type like me.
Through the two days, I learnt about Tech4Devs products, I spoke to non-profit leaders and their teams, I spoke with different intermediaries doing phenomenal work in the sector. All the conversations, pushing me a step ahead in my curiosity game. While I was connecting with people, the conversations and sessions were pushing me to connect the dots in my mind.
Ironic to the purpose of the event being a tech sprint, I had quite a few technology challenges, my laptop stopped working, my phone charging cable broke. While these were minor hindrances, they didnt stop me from learning more and more about how technology and data can accelerate the impact nonprofits are making in the Indian Development Sector. I filled my notebook with mind maps. It felt like a fresh start, learning about technology, away from it.
The first day was an overview of the
Glific
product, how it is being used by nonprofits. We also got to hear from
Agency Fund
about their approach to supporting data-based innovations. Concluding the day’s agenda, we visited
Aajeevika Bureau
s legal aid centre for informal workers.It was a small room, by the look of it a small call centre. However, this 4-people team caters to about 1500 legal cases a month, with a solving rate of 60%, for the informal workers group in Rajasthan and India. Even the judicial system will get intimidated by the pace of this. It was phenomenal how the operators dealt with situations, keeping the user-centric lens at all times.
While the day was formally over, a bunch of people headed to a place called Khamma Gani. As welcoming as the phrase Khamma Gani is, so was the vibe in the team dinner. By the lake, with melting horizons, reflecting blurry lights, we ate delicious Laal Maas and Shammi kebab.
Day 2 was understanding about the other products of
Project Tech4Dev
, getting to know other partners, and just brewing thoughts for the rest of the time.The team concluded the day, singing away with the sunset dawning upon the majestic Monsoon Palace.
When you think of Udaipur, you think of tradition, of palaces, of royalty. This Tech4Dev Sprint redefined the idea of Udaipur for me. This was the first social gathering that did not intimidate me. Given how anxious I get among people, this space let me be, let me think, and let my curious mind do what it’s best at, sit and learn, sit and observe, ponder and reflect.
The Sprint gave me a tiny glimpse of what technology and data, and the power of human minds leveraging it can do to make our country a better place to live in. It amazes me how much people want to do for the benefit of other people. There is a high magnitude of challenges in a country like ours. But, there is also a high amount of talent and endless potential to shift gears, change the narrative and surpass barriers.I came back with a lot of insights, renewed vigour, a charged and inspired mind, to work on many more projects that drive impact, build many such connections that accelerate change.Title: Sprints are Back: Second Education Cohort Day 1 Welcome to Dehradun

The education cohort sprint brings together an amalgamation of folks from tech, social impact and the folks juggling both these roles seamlessly. This is where the small group of thoughtful and committed citizens, connected over discord get to meet in person to accelerate cross learning, problem solve with each other, level up the tech game and most of all celebrate the people and the wins for which the platform is in service of.
It was therefore only fitting to get this group who is nonstop on the go in resolving issues, developing cutting edge tech for good, and unlocking high scale impact to huddle up and reflect on the months gone by doing what they do best.
The team in huddle
One of the first things we did was to celebrate the wins that have been enabled by the use of technology and
Glific
platform. A sure shot way to get a boost of dopamine to refuel for the work being done. Here are some of the wins shared by the NGO and
Glific
team present on spot.
Naveli and Aparna from
STiR education
celebrated winning partnerships with 2 state governments (Tamil Nadu and Karnataka). Enabled by tech, this team showcased behavioural information of key education stakeholders (district leaders, school leaders and teachers) in government schools. This partnership will help the systems identify best practices and areas that need more support, thus putting STIR one step further towards their vision of creating a world where children love learning and teachers love teaching.
Naveli and Aparna from Stir Education
Abhishek from
Indus Action
celebrated creating strategic data pipelines that will enable NGOs to save time for data processing, data analysis and will speed the delivery of services to thousands of beneficiaries. Another win that Abhishek was proud to share was scripting an algorithm for the AP govt, that will enable right to education (RTE 12.1.C) for hundreds of disadvantaged students and will help them to get allocations in private schools.
Abhishek from Indus Action
Gautam and Tejas from
Reap Benefit
celebrated the success of integrating the IVRS with the
Glific
chatbot which helped onboard more than 5k citizens from Delhi in less than 3 months to become Paryavaran Mitras and start contributing in local civic and climate participation. This will enable them to build self reliance and resilience to tackle climate change at a hyper local level.
Tejas and Gautam from Reap Benefit
Abhideep from
Gramvani
celebrated piloting conversational Q&A over voice which helps to disseminate knowledge on modern agricultural practices. Adaption of this technology could potentially help 600,000 farmers across MP and Bihar alone to get more financially resilient, transition to organic farming, improve the ferticility of the soil they are cultivating. The same technology could potentially be extrapolated to various fields like healthcare, access to schemes and so on.
Abhideep from Gramvani
Abhishek and Erica celebrated onboarding new NGOs to the
Glific
family. Their rationale for celebrating winning over these NGOs is the certainty and the excitement they feel for accelerating the impact in the diverse backgrounds that will be enabled by using Glific, some of the high impact and scale names that the team fondly recalls onboarding are
Deshpande Foundation
,
Digital Green
,
Key Education Foundation
,
VOPA
Erica and Abhishek from Glific
No win, how big or small, is possible flying solo and there is always something or someone to be grateful for. As a sprint comes to an end and another one begins, we touch base with counting our blessings and being grateful for the good things that are on going.
Here were some snapshots from the sticky notes of appreciation and gratitude from both NGO teams and the
Glific
team for the awesome job that they have been doing. This is the fuel for the engine that keeps the gears of change turning.Title: Sprints, Connections, and Impact across cities

==================================================

It’s been almost a month since I’ve been away from home, traveling to different cities for sprints and meeting new people. Usually, I work remotely from Pauri, a town in Uttarakhand, but these sprints have given me a chance to explore new places, meet interesting people and see their work. It’s been a fun journey.
I started with the Agency Fund sprint in Bangalore. The sprint had two tracks: User Engagement and AI/LLM. I attended the AI/LLM track. You can read about my experience here
Bangalore Sprint: Innovating User Experience with LLMs
We had some fantastic NGOs presenting their work, including
Digital Green
,
Bandhu
,
Jakaranda Health
,
Udhyam
,
Kabakoo
, and
Noora Health
.
I met Sylvia and Stanislaus from
Jacaranda Health
and attended a fantastic workshop on prompt engineering by Edmund from Agency Fund. You can check out the workshop details here:
Prompt Engineering 201
I also met Godwin and Ousmane from
Kabakoo Academies
. After the first sprint, they came to the Omidyar Network office in Bangalore, where the rest of the Tech4Dev team was working together for a week. Later that day we went out for dinner with them
Met Varun from
OpenNyAI
. He shared the work
OpenNyAI
is doing, including their successful product Jugalbandi, which many NGOs use in Glific. We’ve had calls with Varun and
OpenNyAI
team in the past to help NGOs experiment with Jugalbandi. Here’s a blog about one of our early experiments:
ChatGPT Comes to Glific
.
After the Agency Fund sprint, I joined the
Dalgo
sprint, where the
Dalgo
team hosted its first sprint with new NGOs. You can read more about it here:
Bangalore Sprint First NGO’s Sprint for Dalgo and Quarterly Review
The next few days were spent working from the Omidyar Network office and visiting a few NGO offices in Bangalore.
Met with Akshay, Ramesh, Mekin, and the
Udhyam
team at their office. During lunch, Chris from
Medha
, Linus and Jake from
The Agency Fund
, and Abhishek from
Noora Health
joined us. Akshay talked about the Udhyam program and the challenge of analyzing images from children. I mentioned our recent integration of GPTVision in Glific, which could help with initial image evaluation. We also had a brief community engagement session to understand their needs and explore ways we can offer more support.
Met Gloria, Mekha, Navneeth, and Sujith from the
Guardians of Dreams
. We had dinner and had fun talking. They invited us to visit their office whenever we get the time. It was in Koramangala, and I thought I might not get a chance on this trip as it was far from our Airbnb.
After the LLM sprint, I stayed in touch with Rajsekhar from
Digital Green
and planned to visit their office in Koramangala. Since our meeting was set for 1 PM, I planned to come early to meet the
Guardians of Dreams
first, then go to Digital Green. Starting early also helped in avoiding Bangalore traffic during the day
Met Rajsekhar from
Digital Green
, and Vineet, their CTO, joined us., and we talked about making conversations more unstructured and easy, as it can take multiple iterations to get all the information from beneficiary. We had lunch at a nearby North Indian place, which I was missing in the south. We then discussed how they used
Ragas
to improve their farm Chatbot.
The next day, I visited the
Key Education Foundation
office and caught up with Swarupa and Sheetal, who have been part of a few of our sprints. I also met the rest of the KEF team. I showed them different possibilities using OpenAI in Glific, which sparked a few ideas as they are preparing for upcoming academic session.
Here’s the slide:
Exploring possibilities with Open AI
I talked with Mangal Pandey during a walk about how LLMs work and how KEF can use them for their program. Later, I had a community session with Swarupa and Sheetal, who suggested hosting more sessions for NGOs from similar sectors to brainstorm and learn from each other. We’re planning meetups in Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai soon.
After Bangalore, I went to Delhi for the Glific sprint. Before we had our first informal team meeting at the sprint location with the rest of the Glific team on Sunday evening we had an informal team dinner with Amit Ji’s family
Glific Sprint was a 5-day long event with a good mix of everything. We spent the first two days at the Tech4Impact Chatbot Accelerator, had a quarterly review on the third day, visited Goonj and worked on the fourth day, and wrapped up with a city meetup and happy hour on the final day.
Tech4Impact Chatbot Accelerator
This was the 3rd cohort of the program, designed to help NGOs digitse and scale their program using WhatsApp. Over two days, 24 NGOs built their WhatsApp chatbots. They were split into nine groups, each with at least one POC from the Glific Team for support. I worked with three NGOs and met many new people
Met Dr Ninad & Dr Tushar from
Apnalaya
. Apnalaya supports the urban poor, offers civic education, and helps with essentials. Their vision with the chatbot is to connect volunteers, address community issues, and direct them to the right resources. In two days they were able to understand the basics of Glific and how to build flow. They even tried GPTVision where one can share the picture of their civic issue and use GPT to categorize the issue.
Met Nitesh, Balaa & Shivani from KER. KER partners with innovators to rethink education, empowering students and teachers. Their vision with a chatbot is to use gamification to teach 21st-century skills. They’ve been planning their conversation flows for over two months and now need to build them in Glific. Can’t wait to see how their program turns out!
Met Shubham and Mohit from
Wedogood
.
Wedogood
connects organizations with skilled people to boost their impact. Their vision with a chatbot is to plan projects, recruit volunteers, and get updates on current projects. Mohit is an Enthusiastic developer exploring every API and 3rd party integration in Glific while Shubham, has a clear vision for the bot and completed a number of activities quickly during the program, including outlining the bot’s future steps which he later presented to the entire group as well
Met Harshvi and Jerin from
Sol’s ARC
.
Sol’s ARC
focuses on helping vulnerable learners with education and jobs. Their vision with a chatbot is to give teachers, special educators, and parents tools and strategies for kids with special needs. They already have a few documents that they want to use as knowledgebase to leverage OpenAI file search. In a brainstorming session with them, we were able to plan version 1 of Chatbot with a basic flow and then will keep making small enhancements in the flow over time
City meetup
CityMeetup is for all NGOs to connect and collaborate with others using Glific. Hosted in your city, you’ll hear success stories, explore Glific’s tools, learn to boost impact, connect with fellow NGOs, pick up best practices for conversational design, and end with key takeaways and next steps.
Met Kriti from
Dost Education
and Shuchi from
Indus action
. We talked about how they’re using Glific and what’s new with them. With Kriti, we tried out GPTVision to create images from a storybook for their bot. Normally, this takes them a week, but we did it in half an hour with just a few prompts.
Key takeaways from
Not every conversation has tangible immediate outcomes. Sometimes, just being present, listening, and seeing the world from others’ perspectives is equally important. I talked with many people during these sprints, and it was a nice break from daily development. It was great to see the amazing work everyone is doing.
While we all work remotely, it’s always nice to meet in person and have random non-sense conversations outside of work. Go for walks, dinner, drinks, and explore the city. Especially enjoy those morning breakfasts we earn after a 30-minute walk.
Building a platform is a rewarding journey, but seeing others use it is even better. Small enhancements or bugs can seem big to non-tech users and might become obstacles to adopting new features.
As our team is growing with new members joining every quarter, we should make an extra effort to make them comfortable and check in on how they’re doing. Though we meet quarterly and have a lot to catch up on with our groups, always keep an eye out for new members and try to involve them too.
A great product isn’t just about features or intuitive UI; it’s also about the community and how easy it is to get help. Documentation and product videos are useful, but people still value a human touch.Title: Starting the new year with reflections on Dalgo’s direction

==================================================

The first sprint of the year 2025 and this time we were camped out of Mahabalipuram (58 KMs from Chennai), a city of rock temples and monuments filled with ancient history. With its shore touching the Bay of Bengal, the town is blessed with an evening breeze that helps you calm down and reflect on the activities of a long day. This sprint week was also full of reflections, meaningful conversations with NGOs, and internal discussions about potential future features of Dalgo.
We had around 8-9 NGOs (~12 participants in total) attending the sprint for a period of 2 days. And the Dalgo team had a couple of goals/aims with them going into the sprint
Facilitate/co-facilitate sessions on “Leveraging AI for non-profits” and “Practical challenges on data” (Aditya from Goalkeep took the lead on this session) to help NGOs
Discuss our roadmap to the NGOs and get feedback from the NGOs
Prepare a prototype for the chat with data feature and get feedback from the NGOs
Get some quick wins during the work time
In addition to the above, I had some goals of my own
Listen & understand how the NGOs are currently using Dalgo
LIsten & understand what other problems are they facing in their org that Dalgo could potentially help them with
Get a rough blueprint in my mind of Dalgo’s direction for the next 2 quarters based on internal discussions and conversations with NGOs
NGO sessions/workshop
s
Leveraging AI with non-profits (Ref
ppt
)
Pratiksha and Sanjeev did a great job curating the presentation & facilitating the session. The session started with some high level explanation of topics like token limits, context windows and chat poisoning in the context of chatbots, to help understand NGOs some limitations of using LLM models. It then moved on to show a comparative analysis of most popular LLM providers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude AI, Meta AI) out there and what could be their best use cases.
Prompt engineering was up next. Due to internet issues, facilitators couldn’t conduct the exercise for prompt engineering and thus the session felt a bit monotonous. However, the session was more of a refresher since many NGOs had been using ChatGPT in their day to day work. Pratiksha then took the participants through some of the Gen AI tools (you can find all the references/names of the tools in the ppt attached above)
Sanjeev concluded the session talking about the risks of using AI and how to approach a problem with a potential AI solution. The picture below sums it up very nicely
Practical challenges on data
This session was one of my highlights from the sprint. Aditya (from
Goalkeep
) did a great job facilitating this. I found the framework of
5 Why
s, that he introduced to drill down a problem statement and figure out its root cause, very interesting and something new that I learned from the session. The idea behind this is, many times the problem doesn’t exactly seem to be what it is and you have a different view of it when you try to dig deeper.
Each NGO had a Tech4dev team facilitating or asking the “whys” to drill down on the problem statement. I was sitting with Vinod with Akshata (Product/Data engineer) & Rohit (MnE) from
Antarang Foundation
. One of the problem statements we discussed, started off with a data quality issue where an MnE team member had to do more ad hoc analysis to figure out why the numbers seemed the way they were. After drilling down, we understood that the issue was more of data trust and access. The numbers were off due to pipeline failures/reset on Dalgo. A simple solution to start with was to give the MnE team (Rohit) access to Dalgo dashboard so they have more visibility over the data pipeline of the org and can access the elementary dashboard. A more thorough approach we discussed was to build a data validation/quality dashboard that will help the MnE team to trust it more. We agreed that the MnE team should be involved more in this exercise.
Following the “5 Whys” exercise, the participants had a choice to go to any of the three round table discussions to share their problem(s) & learn from the other NGO participants. Each table had Tech4dev team member(s) facilitating the conversations.
Data Quality & Pipeline Reliance
Operationalize data to enable decision making
Communicate our story effectively using data
All the 3 topics were very well thought out and apt based on what we heard the previous day from conversation with participants and the work we have been doing with them.
Chat with data feature demo
Our current data analysis feature lets users ask one off questions on their data. It has two inherent limitations
Users need to write a sql filter which sets the context for the question
The answer given is a one time summary in the sense that one cannot ask any follow up questions
The prototype we developed takes in a user query in natural language and does the following to reach to an answer
Convert the text to sql
Run the sql to show results and then ship them off to LLM provider (Open AI)
Setup a file search assistant on data uploaded in step 2 and ask the query
We wanted to validate our idea of chat with data and how useful it would be for the NGOs. We ran it against sample/synthetic data of the donor, projects and details of the fundings the donor has made against various projects. The session was very engaging, participants were excited & asked a lot of questions. Some of them were (participants didn’t know what columns/tables were there under the hood)
I want to know more about the projects donors are funding – Our bot was able to answer this correctly, it gave a list of 5-6 projects with donor details, project details and the amount of funding
Describe your data to me in English – The bot responded with a schema of the columns and their meaning
What’s the correlation between project length and budget ? – The bot first responded with a python code that computes the correlation coefficient, we had to ask it 2-3 more questions to force it to compute and spit the value of correlation coefficient
I have a program that helps children with their homework, how likely is it for the donors to fund us and why ? – It answered it very nicely in a generic manner.
Summarizing the overall feedback based on the comments/feedback from the NGOs during the demo
This feature could be used for exploratory data analysis and ad hoc analysis/reporting by MnE teams.
How do the users trust the analysis done by LLMs (bot) ? For example, the correlation coefficient
Is it possible for the chat feature to spit out visualization/charts when prompted with a question ?
How do we handle the limitations on context windows ? If a question requires sending a large amount of data to the LLMs, it might exceed or exhaust the context limit.
To this point, I questioned a few participants to come up with queries/questions in their use case that would require sending millions and millions of rows to LLM. In most cases, the users are interested in looking at a slice of data (eg, give me aggregated “metric” by year or by age or by state etc.)
How can we export the analysis that the bot has presented in a format (maybe excel or csv) that is easily shareable to various stakeholders ?
How can we hide the PII information to use this feature safely
During the next two days of the sprint, I sat with folks from
Antarang
and
Janaagraha
to run the “chat with data prototype” on their own datasets. It worked quite well, it was able to answer 75-80% of their queries. An additional observation was that folks weren’t interested in doing a lot of back & forth (i.e. chat) rather they asked very specific questions – got the answer to it in the first go and moved on.
Dalgo roadmap
Based on the conversations during the sprint and the consulting work we have doing with our NGOs, the broad areas in the roadmap on which we will focus or work to build Dalgo features look like
User interface for Data transformations
Integrating the chat functionality
Tools for presentation and storytelling
Operational reviews with qualitative insights
Mobile access for non-power users
One thing that our Dalgo team agrees on is that Dalgo needs to be more NGO centric and its features need to move in this direction. Catering to the ecosystem will set us apart from other tools out there in the market who might be equal to us in terms of tech.
On the closing day of the sprint, we also identified people from various organizations who agreed to collaborate in building various features listed above. I am very excited to work closely with them in the next few months
Highlights from the week
The weather in Mahabalipuram was beautiful and evening beach walks with everyone were so soothing. We would just go to the beach and sit there for sometime
Playing basketball in the morning with the Avni team and folks from Tech4dev was so much fun. I didn’t expect the hotel to have a basketball court but we lucked out.
I had some amazing seafood, mutton and biryani. Food just keeps getting better and better every time I explore a new city/town in South India. There are a whole lot of places I haven’t visited in South India and hopefully I get a chance to visit them this year.
I had an interesting conversation with Vinod and Sanjeev on our way to get some filter coffee at Ananda Bhavan (2km walk from the hotel).
We discussed/debated if “chat” in “chat with data” is really the way to go, NGOs just want an answer to their question and shouldn’t have to go back & forth for it. In most cases, they do know the question they are asking & the metric they are looking for.
We also talked about if traditional ML like prediction, forecasting etc. would be useful to the NGOs. It might in some cases like maybe for Anandita (MnE) from Sneha who currently uses Strata to do her statistical analysis.
Could we just use an agentic framework to generate python code for the question they are asking and then run it to get the answer. This way we would be able to “trust” the answer and then convince/market it to the users in that way.
I sat with the
Antarang
team to help with their bigquery cost issue. They have been seeing spikes and wanted to understand where it came from. We were able to figure out the root cause of the spikes which were some of the queries from the old pipeline which are still running. Bigquery’s information schema has a jobs table (
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
) that tracks each & every query along with the amount of data processed (which can be used to compute cost).
Another quick win was with the
Sneha
team where we figured out their missing cases in Dalgo. Some cases were visible in their commcare instance but not in Dalgo.The case didn’t have a form attached/filled for it and commcare’s list api doesn’t fetch such kinds of the case. These cases entered sneha’s commcare via the migration exercise that happened a few months back. And this was done via the backend, so these cases didn;’t have any kind of registration form filled even with the status being open. To have sync in the pipeline, we decided to attach some dummy form to it and fill it programmatically.
I got to know more about Bhumi and their processes from the “Chai Pe Charcha” event.
Bhumi
has a little over 2,00,000 volunteers to help them in their mission. One of the problems they face managing this staggering number of volunteers is in data collection. Volunteers don’t follow the template when collecting data from the field and hence requires more manual efforts to validate it.Title: Status of technology in the non-profit sector (study of around 35 NGOs – Indian and International)

, I have engaged in detailed conversations with approximately 35 NGOs (both Indian and international) and gained insights into their technological requirements. Based on my observations, I would categorize the technology needs of NGOs into three broad groups:
Large-scale organizations with custom-built software solutions
have technical platforms and systems in place, but lack the expertise to maintain and improve them effectively. These organizations need support to optimize their existing applications and process.
Mid-sized organizations
often have effective programs on a smaller scale and are planning to scale up. They require guidance on how to manage their operations on a larger scale and which technology solutions they should implement. Some of these organizations may have custom-built software solutions for specific projects, but based on prior experiences with software development, they may be hesitant to put in the effort of developing a new application from scratch. In some cases, the existing software (whether custom or off-the-shelf solutions) may not be suitable, and they require technical assistance to strategize their next phase or suggest alternative solutions.
Small-sized organizations
do not have any automated systems in place and rely on basic applications such as email and online conferencing. These organizations are interested in taking their operations online after the COVID-19 pandemic and require guidance on what applications to use and how to scale up their operations.
Technology plays a crucial role in scaling operations and effectively managing them, regardless of the size of the organization.
As different organizations have different requirements the skill set of a CxO would vary accordingly. For large organizations with custom-built software solutions, they would require someone with a software development background who can assess the technical architecture and ensure scalability. For smaller and mid-size organizations who are open to exploring off-the-shelf solutions, they would need someone who has experience in software research and implementation. Tech4Dev has a team of CxOs equipped to handle both types of organizations, and committed to only accepting engagements where they feel they can add value.
In terms of technology required for NGOs to operate effectively, there are three main areas: office automation systems, communication systems, and project management and reporting. Despite this, many organizations are still managing different departments in traditional ways, using Excel or manual methods (yes, there are organizations that collect data from the field on pen and paper and then enter them onto Excel later). Those who end up using software often struggle in several ways, including:
Small and mid-sized NGOs that incorporate technology often encounter difficulties in implementing appropriate technology solutions lack of documenting the essential features and insufficient research. In many cases, they rely solely on software demos and do not test the software before making a purchase, leading to the utilization of applications that are unsuitable for their requirements.
For larger organizations that have custom-built solutions, it is challenging to retain an in-house tech team because corporate salaries are higher. Moreover, the relationship with software vendors is often not optimal for various reasons. NGOs tend to lack a fixed plan and strategy before starting a software project. They may have a broad idea of what they want, and software firms may still proceed with a broad discussion. However, as things keep changing for obvious reasons in the coming days, the relationship often turns sour.
One of the challenges we have encountered is instances where software development was done on a pro-bono basis. However, after the development phase, the cost of maintenance and training becomes unsustainable. Consequently, immediately after the development, the organization finds it difficult to continue funding the expenses and starts looking for alternatives. This situation arises due to a lack of proper planning and foresight. Read a related article here
Pro-bono aint free
.
During my experience, I have encountered several instances where a platform was selected, and the team was asked to start using it without proper training and guidance. As a result, the adoption of the platform was poor, and employees felt compelled to change their working methods without adequate support.
With all this in mind Tech4Dev and I are committed to supporting as many NGOs as possible in the near future. While the specific programs may differ, we have observed that most NGOs require similar office automation and communication systems. As a result, we will be working to create a knowledge base and research documents that can be made publicly available to assist more NGOs. I am thrilled about the possibilities this endeavor presents and the potential to make a significant impact in the sector. By providing reliable technology solutions to NGO leadership and employees, they can focus more on their ground-level work, which is why we are all passionate about working in this sector.Title: Struggling to pull data from SurveyCTO, Commcare, Kobotoolbox and AVNI? Dalgo can help!

==================================================

For the last 12 months we’ve worked with more than ten clients and what we’ve learned from them is that everyone is collecting data from multiple sources and they’re not able to consolidate their data to get a holistic view of their programs. From the initial POC’s which we did we’ve identified the most common data collection tool which Non Profit uses and we’ve built a pipeline so that they can pull their data easily from these sources.
Dalgo offers 300+ connectors like google sheet, salesforce and file(CSV’s) on top of it from our learnings from different orgs
we’ve built
SurveyCTO
,
Commcare
, KoboToolbox,
AVNI
, PaperSurvey and Glific
. We’ve been using Airbyte under the hood and we’ve contributed back to the platform to help and grow the ecosystem.
AVNI PR Is merged on Airbyte Platform
We always try to contribute to opensource platforms and so far 3 out of 6 is merged on airbyte platform. This year our plan is to merge existing connector to airbyte as part of our c4gt collaboration.
What does Dalgo Platform offer compared to other tools?
300+ sources
and custom connector development
No cap on
no. of users
using the platform. You can onboard as many.
DBT integration
to handle the transformation and building models. Integrated with Github so you can track who’s changing the models.
Orchestration tool
which lets you schedule your pipelines according to your needs.
No cap on number of
connections and sources
. So you make as many you want
Access to any new feature release and we’re targeting quite a few things on our
Roadmap
Five hours of Support for the platform and we’ve a Discord channel where you can ask any questions.
Superset Intergration with DALGO
We’ve integrated superset mainly because its opensource and when its opensource we can control or build new functionality. This is what we offer if you choose superset as your visualization tool
Again no cap there on the number of users using the superset.
We’re also offering superset usage dashboard which gives you
List of user on the platform
Active users
List of dashboards
No. of user accessing the dashboard
No. of visits per user
The next big feature releases
UI for Transformations
We started facing lot of challenges with our NGO’s clients where they didn’t have enough technology people or skill in their team and some of the common challenges we’ve been seeing was
DBT installation and working with sql.
Modeling of the data on scale.
Not able to add new source to dbt or pipeline and not able to do transformation easily.
We’ve integrated DBT in our platform which doesn’t do much for a NGO user.
After this, we decided to work on UI for transformation which is very common in lot of data tools and as a team we worked on the plan to build this and the approach we took was the learning from our previous experience with lot of DBT models we’ve written for SHRI, STIR, SNEHA and LAHI. Collectively we might have written over 250+ models and we picked most common features from this which you can read about
here
.
This is how it looks like how you can design models now and I’m expecting my team to write a more detailed blog on this 🙂
2
. We’ve been focusing on
Data insights and Data quality
features for a NGO user so they can get minimal information from their data at the start and they can start thinking about how to make a model in a better way.
3.
Another feature we’re working on is
RBAC(role based access control)
for a NGO user which you can read about
here
. This has come up with a few NGOs we’ve worked with to give limited access to certain users which we thought was a great feature to have and a very common feature in any ETL tool.
We’re very motivated to take this platform to the next level so please reach out to us if we you think Dalgo can help and solve your Data integration and pipeline problems.Title: Summer Intern Report from Cindy Z
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: August 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/summer-intern-report-from-cindy-z/
==================================================

Hi everyone! I’m Cindy, a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying Business and Data Science. This past summer, I was an intern on the frontend team, which was led by Kurund, and worked alongside Vaibhav and Calvin on 0.1 and 0.2 versions of Glific. I learned about Glific through an organization called Blueprint at UC Berkeley where we create software for nonprofits and was excited to see and work on a larger scale project that would impact nonprofits everywhere.
Learning New Technologies!
As soon as I joined, I had a lot of work to do. I had used React + HTML/CSS before but had very minimal experience with Typescript. In addition to that, I was lost in the codebase – the frontend team had made lots of progress from the month prior to my joining. However, with the help of my co-intern Calvin and Kurund’s guidance, I was onboarded in no time.
Despite my initial frustrations with Typescript, I soon learned that there would be many more technologies to learn. I learned that we used GraphQL for querying and connecting with databases, but Axios for login and registration. I also used Jest and Enzyme for testing and Formik/Material UI for our aesthetic needs. Needless to say, decisions about which technologies would suit our needs best were being made every day, and I was able to learn about each one. The fast-paced environment of Glific really pushed me to grow as a frontend developer!
My Work
One of the largest projects that I worked on was the login and registration flow. This also included screens like ‘Forgot Password’, and ‘Confirm OTP’.
To own the frontend of so many pages was challenging definitely but fulfilling in seeing it to its completion. When there were API changes I needed or suggestions on improving the design I had for these screens, the backend and design teams were very responsive and took my ideas seriously. This was one of the things I most enjoyed about working at Glific – that I was able to think about the product from various perspectives and learn about how the backend/design processes worked, but also that it truly felt like a team effort.
Code Quality
I was definitely learning a lot in terms of quantity – I was learning new languages, using new packages, and writing lots of code, but I also realized code
quality
was just as, if not even more important. I learned how to write tests using Jest & Enzyme and used CodeBeat for measuring our quality in the codebase.
Before joining Glific, I knew it was important to write succinct and powerful code, but testing definitely took this to a new level. Even though things may work on a screen level, testing really ensured that I understood what was happening with each component I created. An important skill I learned was how to generalize components and reuse them throughout the codebase to reduce repeating code. This oftentimes meant editing components that other people wrote, and sometimes created merge conflicts but it definitely made our code easier to understand and quicker to build on top of for future developers.
Conclusion
Throughout the 1 AM standup calls to pushing changes right before a release, I can say that I definitely learned a lot and grew as a frontend developer. I am very grateful for all the support and guidance I received from Kurund, Vaibhav and Calvin, and the backend team as well as Abhishek for being understanding and patient whenever I had suggestions about API or Sketch changes. Although my internship has come to an end, I really think Glific has enormous potential to improve communication for NPOs and has a very, and I mean
very
dedicated team behind it to bring it to life, so if I have the chance, you can catch me developing open-source code for Glific!Title: TAF and Tech4Dev – our Experience at Involve

==================================================

This blog is written by Nidhi Thomas from
Involve Learning Solutions Foundation
At Involve, we were one of the most nascent organisations at the sprint…. but that helped us to our advantage as we adsorbed and reflected on everyone’s amazing experiences. We heard inspirational journeys of experienced organisations – how they navigated their
problem space, how they designed (and redesigned solutions at times) and they were also so very candid about sharing stories of when things didn’t work as they had anticipated. We have taken this plethora of learnings and are in the process of analysing it to build our
solution (we are aware that our planned solution is ambitious but interacting with the folks at the sprint gave us hope and confidence that we were on the right track).
Though we had some amazing thought-provoking sessions, the 2 that stood out to me were the Intervention Design session by James Walsh and the User Experience for Engagement by Yuxi Liu. James’s session led us into a thought-provoking journey of how important it was to have institutional transparency, trust as well as making informed collective unbiased decisions that benefit the entire organisation. Yuxi’s session, on the other hand, taught us the elements that we need to focus on to engage our users. On behalf of a lot of others in
the room, I can confidently say that we realised some were actually obvious skills, which we often tend to overlook.
And how can I end without describing the amazing time that we all had and the amazing, warm people that we got a chance to interact with. It indeed felt like a family get together where we were having lots of fun and learning a lot from each other’s experiences. I have
made so many friends and I know that I can reach out to them when I need their help or even when I feel like having a fun chat with them.
Thank you
The Agency Fund
and
Project Tech4Dev
for hosting this event and we are looking forward to many more.
Until the next One!Title: TAP and DDP Engagement
Author: Ishan Koradia
Date: June 2023

==================================================

About TAP
The Apprentice Project
(TAP) is an initiative under the MentorMe Foundation that has a vision of Enabling all children to become world leaders. The TAP initiative focuses on building 21st century skills among under-served children studying in government or low-income private schools. These 21st century skills include critical thinking, self-confidence and problem solving.
Currently, TAP has a AI & NLP powered whatsapp chatbot which is built using the
Glific platform
called the TAP buddy. Through this chatbot, wisely curated activities & interactive lessons on various topics are sent to students that will help them achieve the above mentioned skills. Till date, TAP has impacted
14K students
across
150 schools
across pan India.
TAP�s Current Data Sources
The Glific data (or the data from TAP buddy) goes into their dedicated Google BigQuery warehouse. The operations team uses Google sheets to register students and maintain information about their batches, courses, schools and units (a break up of a course). Their dashboard on Google Data Studio has been built on top of cumbersome & complicated sql queries that merge both (BigQuery & Google sheets) the data sources to compute program level metrics for assessment.
Problems faced by operations team
Data entered into Google sheets by the operations team has no proper validation and breaks the dashboard at times. Due to the significant number of tables in the BigQuery warehouse, it becomes difficult to understand how data is being transformed. On top of this for any change in the google sheet, the team needs to manually run the queries so that the dashboard is refreshed and up to date. Lastly TAP expects to scale to
1 M students
across pan India by
March 2028
and google sheets might not be the best solution in long run for their operations.
Proposed Solution
Our initiative
Development Data Platform
(DDP) solves many of the above mentioned challenges. However, we realized before onboarding them for DDP there was a dire need to shift them away from google sheets to a better data entry tool (or a CRM). Our research showed that
Frappe
could be a potential CRM that can cater to the needs of TAP operations. Frappe is a low code, open source, full stack web framework that can help build database-driven applications. So to sum up, the solution to improve TAPs system and be in sync with their already stable TAP buddy involved building a CRM and then running DDP to validate their dashboards.
(Login page of the CRM system)
(Dashboard with dummy data)
Pilot
After proposing the above solution, we spent the next few weeks validating it. We built a full fledged CRM for TAPs operations team on Frappe where they can add/delete/edit information about students, schools, batches, units and activities. Frappe has a whole lot of features like workflows, notifications, frappe forms (just like google forms), multiple users and roles, dashboards, reports, data migration tool etc. To be honest, we have just scratched the surface of Frappes features. Although the software has a learning curve, it’s definitely worth the time and effort to explore. We improved the system by getting feedback from the operations team and building on top of it.
Once the CRM system was deployed on our test servers, we wanted to see and prove that DDP can be helpful. In this, we set up a pipeline that ingested data from the CRM and routed it to the same BigQuery warehouse where TAP buddys data was resting. For doing various transformations, we used
Dbt
which allows for modular and readable sql code. With some basic Dbt setup code, we were to compute and replicate metrics from their current dashboard like Access rate and Submission rate of the activities sent to the students. The entire pipeline was orchestrated and no manual intervention was required to compute the updated dashboard metrics.
Where we are now – Implementation phase
The TAP team was satisfied with the POC and the Frappe CRM. We now plan to deploy a production instance on their infrastructure where we will migrate all their current Google sheets data. Once this is done, our next step would be to work on replicating the dashboard with modular and readable dbt (sql) code that computes all their program level metrics. TAP is also trying to build internal capacity to learn Frappe and implement their internal curriculum content system. Apart from this, we also plan to sync the TAP buddy and the Frappe CRM systems so that whenever something gets updated on the TAP buddy (for eg lets say a new student registered), this is immediately reflected in the CRM.Title: TISS Project Status

Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/announcing-the-release-of-glific-v1-0/
==================================================

After 9 months of intense design, development, testing, and working closely with multiple NGOs we are proud to announce the release of Glific v1.0. If you need a quick background on Glific, a 4-minute product video showcasing the most important features can be
viewed here
. This has been a phenomenally intense journey and gave many of us a critical focus and passion during the months of the pandemic.
A big thanks to the team: Pankaj, Dignesh, Vaibhav, Abhishek, Akhilesh, Ankit, Mohit, Pooja, Anshul, Sanjeev, and Kurund that worked so hard and long to release the product. Also thanks to all our fabulous NGO partners who have worked with us from the early days and lived with the occasional and sometimes frequent bugs.
Team photo during our daily standup
Our main goal has been to build a platform that most NGOs can use without significant customization and we do believe v1.0 has achieved that goal. Our secondary goal is to build a community of users around the platform and that is happening organically on our
super active Discord channel.
Since most of the team and the NGOs are in India, I’m greeted with an avalanche of messages and conversations on the channel when I start work early morning.
We’ll have a formal press release out in the next day or so, but in the meantime, I just wanted to share the team’s reactions to their experience over the past 9 months.
My favorite part is talking about features/innovative ideas and how to apply them technically, and it makes me happy to see how useful it is to people –
Dignesh
My favorite memory was to see the support and usefulness it brings to the NGOs in scaling and reaching a larger audience. I remember when I was in a support call to debug some issue and I could clearly see the happiness and enthusiasm by the NGO while using Glific. –
Shamoon
My favorite part was to see how each feature was developed and how everyone contributed to refining it. The complete cycle of how a feature is developed, from being an idea to bringing that idea to the table, where everyone shared their insights on it, then planning it, developing it, and finally after hours of work releasing it. It just gives me an immense feeling of happiness to see someone actually using the feature which was just an idea a few months ago. –
Akhilesh
My favorite part is to start picking up the abstract piece, develop/build that with the help of the great team, and release it in a useful way. Another thing is that we are taking documentation very seriously. The things I want to get better is to not miss those bugs which we can catch on the staging /cypress itself and fix them before they reach production. Also, I do resonate on the sleepless nights part –
Pankaj
My favorite part is how we’re always trying to improve our app by adding new features and tools to make it more useful to NGOs. “
Clear communication among ourselves as a team and knowledge gathering
” was another personal favorite. –
Pooja
My personal favorite was how much I’ve grown with the product itself, whether it was creating product videos (which I was doing the first time), or hosting webinars which were always daunting (again a first), and then with the design itself, I do take pride in what I created with the entire team. And then my collective favorite is meeting after the ON grant, all of us from different parts of the world celebrating together, focused on the single mission. I also enjoyed the participation of all the NGOs during our research process in the beginning and then receiving their feedback as they were using it. Feeling blessed that there were no frustrated NGOs – or thanks to them for not letting it out on us But also, it was great to connect with all the NGOs and support them in their journey to get started. The process is always painful, trying to come up with something better(mostly the visuals) after each delivery. And it’s all worth it when things come together and get done. –
Abhishek
I’m fond of the pace and passion I felt while working with the team on v1.0, to respond and deliver to the issues and suggestions raised by NGOs. Facilitate NGOs with a more powerful platform to support communication with their beneficiaries and making the platform better day by day. –
Mohit
My not-favorite: weird errors that we get only on production and not development: tackling and fixing them. My favorite: really proud of what we have so far for a project which is less than a year old. Feels great to be working with such an amazing team and the NGOs who keep pushing us to innovate and simplify things. –
Kurund
Favorite Moment
When Abhishek suggested the name Glific and explained the thought behind it. It all connected naturally with the vision behind the project.
Not so favorite moment
The couple of grants that we missed getting. Hopefully, we will get better at it with time. –
Tushar
My not-favorite but fond memory were the sleepless nights when we had operational issues and the backend would reboot with memory issues. My overall favorite is seeing how quickly we can work as a team and release new features on a weekly basis with the amazing tech building blocks that we have at our disposal –
Lobo
I’ll end with gratitude and thanks to the wider open source and product community. This is the golden age for building and releasing products. There are so many external services that we are actively using in Glific today, that it is literally mind-blowing (and worthy of an entire series of blog posts)

It’s such a relief to start writing a blog post when the person nudging you towards writing it has asked you not to spend more than an hour and has assured that no-one is going to read it. Thanks
Lobo
for that assurance. Phew! ????
Social Impact Sprint is an initiative lead by the
Tech4Dev consortium
. The objective was to get people who work on the tech side of the social impact space together (Yes, there’s that side) and get them to talk to each other before they start building another
form builder
.
For an excellent summary of what happened please check out Aman’s (from Plio)
post
.
Here are some of my own learnings and reflections on the week that was!
Do it in the Mountains
No, this isn’t from Unsplash. I took this one.
I’ve got to admit, when I received the email from Lobo inviting me, I decided I wanted to go  because it was happening in Tehri. You mean I get to stay in Uttarakhand for a week doing something remotely connected to tech? One for me please. I’m so glad that we could do this from the Mountains. They’ve still got the charm where a lady will stop a hiking group, walk up to her Gauva tree and pluck 30 guavas to keep us company for the hike. Thank you Tehri!
Eat strategy for Breakfast
The team at
ColoredCow
are the most gracious and giving hosts. I perhaps learnt the most observing how they function. Their biggest achievement is that they’ve got a happy, enthusiastic team that gives it all. It was great to witness people genuinely excited about their role. They’ve managed to build young leaders so much you’d not know who their founder/CEO is despite being in the same room. Congratulations team! You’re an inspiration. Their initiative of
weekly story sharing
was a major highlight. I hope this becomes a norm at all organisations. A safe space for expression, being vulnerable and connecting with each other. They’ve managed to do all this while sporting suits, getting paid to do open source and brewing coffee with beakers that can put a COVID testing lab to shame. Wow.
Tushar – Brewing in his lab
Empty space for connections
Thanks to my time at
GeekSkool
I’ve done a bit of volunteering at
tech conferences
. While the idea behind conferences is for people to connect there’s hardly any space-time for that. With only one
tech-talk
in the morning and a
deep-dive
for the evening there was plenty of time to connect and also continue to work. The hikes and having all meals together helped. Not to forget the Coloredcow team diligently hosting drinks every single night. So less talks and more empty space for connections worked wonders. During these times I loved ranting about all things related to grant making and measuring impact with Lobo or learning about what difference documentation can make in everyday product development from
Shen
.
Govt run enterprises are weird
We were given the very best spots for stay in all of Tehri.
The Eco-huts
and the THDC guest house. Interestingly both these spaces are managed by govt enterprises. Despite having access to some of the best infrastructure there’s an eery coldness on how the whole thing is managed and run. The whole experience was a very clear indicator for why government should stay out of running a business. The incentives and the motivation just don’t match up.
Top engineering talent looking at Social Impact
Inspiring to see engineers from some of the top engineering colleges in India actively looking for work in the social impact space. Met grads from BITS Pilani and IIT Guwahati. They have been carefully looking at what type of roles they would like to choose and what kind of impact it leads to. Fantastic. ????
Pragmatic open-source
The Tech4Dev team which is behind the
Glific
platform has a relentless focus on being useful for the real-world. Glific is a fantastic example of pragmatic software where the product combines the idealism of grant supported open-source, social impact with practicality of WhatsApp, Google Big Query and Data Studio. Idealistic realism concoction.
Wishlist for the next sprint
Thank you once again Lobo and the Coloredcow team for making this happen. Here’s my small wish-list for the next sprint.
We should also bring board games
Hackathon nights to build and demo something
All offices should have at least one neon logo

Author: Donald Lobo
Date: July 2024
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4agency-bangalore-sprint-collaborative-learning-and-future-steps/
==================================================

Approx 9 months ago, we collaborated with the Agency Fund to run two sprints with some of their grantees in India and Africa along with a combination of Project Tech4Dev and Agency Fund personnel. The
first sprint in Naivasha, Kenya
was the warm up act, a true unconference, with no specific focus (other than the broad concept of tech and data). It helped us learn a lot from each other between both NGOs and partners, get everyone (or mostly everyone), comfortable with the idea of sharing in an open way, learning from each other and building on each others work. You can read more about this event, in the
multiple blogs here.
We agreed to take it to the next level at the Bangalore, India sprint and focus on two specific tracks. We started off with three, but would up with two based on some initial feedback from the participants. The two tracks were the User Engagement Track and the AI/LLM track. There will be quite a few blog posts (I hope), about both of these tracks, so rather than dive into those tracks per se, I’ll talk about some of my learnings and observations both before and during the sprint.
Broad Agenda and Goals
The UE track folks (Rob, Temina, Patricia, Jamie along with Rocket Learning) spent a lot of time and energy prepping for the talk, giving the NGOs a lot of pre-work, and came in with a definite mission and objectives they wanted to meet. Rob and Temina have been experimenting with different variations and sections of this curricula across the SPC Fellows Cohort 1 and 2, DCP Cohort and the Dasra gathering. So they came in with some tried and tested curricula and an amazing NGO partner in Rocket Learning, who they have worked with over the past year to fine tune some of these concepts. From my perspective, the UE track was quite brilliant, well executed and everyone came out of it with a good idea of potential next steps. The UE track has 8 NGOs participating, with 30 participants.
The AI/LLM track did something completely different. This track had 6 NGOs participating with 20 participants. Since LLMs are relatively new, and each NGO knows a little bit about the work that they did, it was more a peer learning and knowledge sharing track. All the participants got introduced to tools and techniques that they had heard of, but probably not used. The most useful sessions were the ones that onboarded the rest of the NGOs on the tools that one NGO was using (langfuse, ragas, prompt engineering, filesearch, auto-agents etc). Overall, though very different, also as useful and all the participants came out super engaged and energized
We ended the event with an open happy hour in Indiranagar, Bangalore for NGOs in the region. Such open events rarely happen (maybe never happened), and it was great to see the 50+ NGOs attend the event, catch up with old friends (mostly), meet a few new ones and just have a good agenda-less time. There were no expectations or agenda at this event, but I’m glad we got a chance to bring together the local NGO community. We failed/forgot to invite our foundation/funding partners, and in retrospect, it was big mistake on my part. Need to figure out a way how this can happen across India
Hits and Misses
This writeup has gone a bit longer than I expected, so here are some things, which I suspect we’ll iterate on and improve for the next event and some of the joys
We had an organized meet-and-greet on Day 0 of the event, and an impromptu one on Day 2 of the event. The Day 0 event was a lot calmer and people were tentative. Day 2 event was a lot more boisterous. It was in a much smaller space etc, so maybe switching the two gatherings makes sense for future events
We missed doing a group introduction of participants and NGOs on Day 0. I think this is the best time to do it (even though we would be missing a few folks), and let folks know each other better. At the end, I knew the AI/LLM track NGOs fairly well, but only a few on the UE track, and I tried to make a concerted effort to chat with as many folks as I could. Maybe borrow the haiku idea from Mulago foundation and get each NGO to present their work as a haiku.
We did not have any combined sessions between the two tracks. We kinda knew this going in, but could not figure out how to make it happen, and took the easy way out. The next time, we need to make it happen.
For each session, we need to ask the question:
What is the one key learning we want from this session for the group
For the AI/LLM track, I suspect asking this question, would have eliminated at least one session a day. We needed to be a bit more brutal here.
We need to work with the participants, to ensure their presentations are crisp and get to the heart of the problem quickly. Many presentations focussed a fair bit of time on what the NGO does at a very broad level. This is definitely interesting, but sometimes not useful when we are doing a technical deep-dive
We got feedback from the participants after the morning session and at the end of the day. This allowed both tracks to make adjustments both mid-day and end-of-the-day. This was super awesome, and definitely cool to see this play out in real time. Listening and responding to your audience is important!.
The most common issue was the packed agenda (for an unconference!). We did loosen it up a lot in subsequent days, but still grappling with how can we discover the right balance and still keep it productive
Is 3 days enough Should we make it 5 days Will the folks running the tracks go a bit crazy in 5 days (I know, I would!). But questions to ponder
For something like the AI/LLM track, could we work on 1 or 2 large problems collaboratively and come up with a solution. Should we assign each NGO to go investigate and teach the team one of the more recent things that has come out in the past 6 months
We got a bunch of new ideas and thoughts for our soon-to-come AI platform. We also kickstarted the XPlat platform (Experiments Platform) with Rob and Linus.
The last few Tech4Dev sprints have been very product focussed or team focussed. It was quite nice to organize a broader sprint which reminded me of the early tech4dev sprints, the Tehri sprint in particular comes to mind.
Next Steps
Temina started and ended the event with two critical things (which i’ve not seen/done before). Commitments from everyone at the beginning to: Be on Time, Be involved and engaged, Be open and sharing, and (I forgot the 4th, will get this soon)
At the end, we repeated it by committing to a few things going forward after this event. Different folks made different commitments (which they may or may not share), but broadly the T4D team committed to
Continue holding such spaces for the NGO community for the next year
Incorporate our learnings from the AI/LLM track into our platforms
Work with AF into making XPlat an open source platform and Digital Public Good
Talk with NGOs in the broader community more often and learn from some of the cutting edge work that they’ve been experimenting with

Summary & Highlights
Q2 2022
– Welcome to the first Tech4Dev 2.0 quarterly report. Starting off the next version of Tech4Dev with a new set of goals and targets, bigger and bolder. Writing this report while the GarudMaachi sprint is in progress is kinda a nice coincidence since this is the core of our mission and vision: To build the technology ecosystem for the sector by bringing people together, sharing knowledge and learnings, and forming deep and long-lasting relationships.
Tech4Dev
continues to grow. We onboarded
Siddhant Singh
and Mahesh Pradhan last month to the Glific team, and have our first fractional CxO joining us in September.  From a fundraising perspective, we have committed funds for more than 75% of our 3-year target. Given the carry-over funds and revenues that we expect from 1.0, our overall 3-year budget is likely to be in the range of USD 11 million. Weve strengthened our relationship with Dasra. Our goal is to more effectively manage the legal and financial process that supports the scale-up of Tech4Dev 2.0. Ninad Ankleshwaria from Dasra will be responsible for the grant management process
Our
Fractional CxO
(x == Tech, Data, or Tech Strategy) initiative has garnered the most interest amongst foundations. Seems like many of us have recognized this problem and we now have a potential solution. Weve got an existing pilot going with SNEHA Mumbai, and Erica and Vinod have shared an
update in this blog post
. We are also about to pilot this with Indus Action and Reap Benefit starting soon. We are excited to be working on this initiative in partnership with
Agency Fund
and will include their network in Africa and Latin America.
Our women-in-tech pilot is demonstrating the importance of a pilot. We are learning a lot and still trying to figure out what makes sense, when we should intervene, and who our target users are. We are also exploring the space in India and chatting with other NGOs doing similar work (so we can learn, build, or partner with them). An update on our
first pilot with Colored Cow and THDC is here
.
Glific
had a banner quarter. We onboarded 14 NGOs in the last quarter and are starting to see a steady stream of new NGOs and consulting work. Our intense focus on ensuring customer happiness and going the extra mile to help them out is starting to pay off with referrals from our existing NGOs. The quarterly sprints help us build and deploy features that are requested by multiple NGOs and also help us understand their needs better. We are starting to see the beginnings of a nice user community within the Glific NGO ecosystem.
In this quarter,
Avni
had high usage by existing users and started to work with 5 new large non profits. The NGO, Rejuvenating WaterBodies, is using Avni for daily monitoring. This project is being piloted by NITI Aayog, the apex public policy think tank of the government of India. Due to our strong experience in health, a large NGO has chosen to pilot with Avni a statewide rollout with frontline workers. While the good streak in health continues, we also have 2 new organizations from the education sector and one in rural welfare, adding newer use cases that Avni can solve. Most new partners are betting on Avni for projects with hundreds of users to thousands and from private rollouts to public. With fieldwork app foundations well laid, faster and better reporting and analytics are the newer challenges the team is solving. There is a stretch and growth both in the open-source software platform and the team.
We had our first week-long education cohort sprint thanks to the Cisco and Agency Fund grants. We had a group of 36 folks from NGOs, data and software partners participate. Many of the participants wrote
blog posts about their experiences at GarudMaachi.
These articles are well worth a read, or at least a skim. I missed most of the sprint due to Covid, but the articles gave me a detailed view of the happenings during the sprint. Kudos to the Tech4Dev team for pulling this off so nicely and to all the participants for coming in well prepared with objectives and goals for the sprint. Sprints like this is Tech4Devs core mission:
Building and Strengthening the ecosystem
.
Aam Digital – Enabling holistic education at HELGO
The
HELGO
project is supporting children from exceptionally underprivileged backgrounds – often former child laborers. Their mission is to break the vicious cycle between poverty and lack of education. To achieve this, HELGO developed a holistic support program: They enroll kids in school, organize tuition classes, maintain close relationships with the families, provide materials and help students develop life skills through counseling and workshops.
Accordingly, there are a lot of details and activities that the organization has to track. Aam Digital was founded as a digital case management system for them to make all this information easy to manage for the whole team:
Detailed profiles summarize all information of a student in one place, accessible on desktop and mobile. Based on this the team plans the support for each individual.
A custom attendance tracking workflow allows teachers to record classes attendance from their smartphone as quickly as recording it on paper. And the data is shared in real-time with the whole team.
The social workers then identify critical developments on the Aam Digital dashboard, for example students who have been absent from multiple classes this week or kids with a dangerously low BMI who should get additional food support.
With its holistic approach the team rarely follows the same questions when interacting with a family. They heavily use unstructured notes in Aam Digital to keep a flexible case history for each child and maintain it jointly as a team.
“In Aam Digital all our data of a child is in one place, instantly available. We can even access it on the road and offline.
Surya Ghosh, Head of Social Work at HELGO
Reliably tracking all the detailed developments of their students would be almost impossible for HELGO without Aam Digital. Earlier it took 4-6 weeks until the team followed up with absent students because paper attendance registers were collected from the learning centers only once a month. With the digital system they now follow up within a day or two. This has helped reduce the dropout rate from 8.5% to 4%, i.e. by more than 50%.
Aam Digital also helps the organization build trust with its international donors. Dr. Meyer-Hamme, chairman of the German charity funding the program, is confident their donations are utilized well: Aam Digital helps us to have a good overview. With this system we can better see the long-term developments and success of our project in India.
You can see an interactive demo system similar to the one for HELGO
here
or refer to our
summary
. Aam Digital today is a configurable platform and Digital Public Good that serves NGOs across different social sector use cases in nine countries.

Summary & Highlights
Q3 2022
– In the evolution of a startup, there comes a time, when you just get the feeling. The definition and articulation of the problem becomes a lot cleaner, the solution a lot simpler and all pieces fall into place. To me, that moment was during the
sprint in Dehradun
: we had the OG group from Tech4Dev 1.0 (Kurund, Arjav, Arun, Lobo), a new group (Erica, Vinod, Nidhi, Ankit, Gayathri, Ashwin) to shepherd Tech4Dev 2.0, long time partners (Dhwani, Avni, ColoredCow, Svarya) and new partners (Aam Digital, GramVaani, IDInsight). A group of 9 NGOs and a funder, joined us later during the week. We also had our first advisory board meeting where we welcomed
Nidhi Goyal
to the Tech4Dev Board. Nidhi will help with our communications, branding and business development strategy.
The
sprint in Dehradun
was a culmination of all the things weve worked for, and at the same time the beginning of a new journey with its own unique set of adventures and challenges. We discussed and debated a variety of things, went on long walks, played multiple card games and in between found some time to do some work and collaborate on aspects of the two platforms: Glific and Development Data Platform. As
Tariq
remarked:
I came in expecting a very tech focussed sprint. I was surprised to see the collaboration and community were the pillars of the gathering, with technology being the binding agent.
Dehradun Sprint Group photo with NGOs and Partners
Tech4Dev
continues to grow. We onboarded
Vinod Rajasekhar
and
Ankit Saxena
as our first fractional CxOs joining us in September. We have four more folks who have accepted our offers and will be joining us this quarter. We hope to close out the year by
hiring 3 mid level engineers
who are keen to work in the social sector in India. If you know of folks looking to make a social impact,
please send them our way
.
Our grant with
Foss United
was renewed this quarter. Its great to have funders in India who are passionate about Open Source.
We kick started work on the
Development Data Platform,
a platform designed to simplify and leverage the power of data for an NGO. We envision providing a data pipeline which gathers data from multiple systems used by NGOs, pushes them into a data lake, transforms and stores them into a data warehouse. Analysts will be able to use a data workbench at this stage, and the visualization layer will provide dashboards and reports. We are piloting this program with two NGOs in India and will add a few more once we have the platform in place. This idea came about as a direct result of our first Fractional CxO engagement. We expected something like this would happen, but did not think it would happen so soon!
Our
Fractional CxO
initiative now has two full time CxOs (Vinod and Ankit) and one volunteer (Arvind). The team is working across four NGOs (SNEHA, Indus Action, Reap Benefit and Uninhibited). We reunited with our old partner from Tech4Dev 1.0,
Arjav Chakravarti
, who will help structure and design this program so we can work with even more NGOs. We are also working with
Childrens Investment Fund Foundation
on a pilot project of
Technology Strategy and Overview
with some of their grantees, which will dovetail nicely into the Fractional CxO program. If you know of NGOs that this might be a good fit for, please direct them to
our application info and form
.
Our
Platforms
continue to perform quite well both from a sales and revenue perspective. We are also starting to see the interplay between our platforms and the Fractional CxO programs. We plan on hiring business development, marketing and customer support folks to help create more awareness for our platforms and onboard more NGOs onto using them.
Glific
onboarded 11 new NGOs, and was
close to break even last quarter.
Glific finally saw the long awaited traffic spike, with the number of messages delivered last quarter 3x more than the previous quarter.
Avni
currently
serves 45 NGOs with 4500+ users on the platform. 4 of the new NGOs are collaborating with state governments with a goal to build and hand over systems to the government. Similar to Glific, due to these NGOs, the usage has gone up significantly in the past few months. Our new partner,
Aam Digital
recently received the Berlin Startup Scholarship and is currently serving 12 NGOs across the world. Aam started the co-creation process of an adapted platform for a mentorship of NGOs in Germany, the client there highly appreciates their understanding of the social sector and is already planning to extend the project.
If you still are wondering why we do and what we do, our friend
Jim Fruchterman
from
Tech matters
has written an article explaining it all in simple terms, it’s well worth a read:
Open Source Software for the Modern NonProfit
India Development Review (IDR) – Media Platform for the Social Sector
In 2021, Tech4Dev and
IDR
began a partnership to build a knowledge base around tech in the social impact space. In the first year, this took the
form of a special series
that sought to demystify technology, with articles that spoke to various stakeholders (funders, intermediary entities, nonprofit leaders) and explored different facets of working with tech. This series was born from the premise that access to information and knowledge that is relevant to stakeholders, is crucial to strengthening any ecosystem. Such knowledge can lead to better funding decisions, it can influence policy, and it can improve how organizations are run.
We need to build a knowledge base for tech that everyone can learn from. Picture courtesy: Pixabay
This overarching objective of building a knowledge base around tech and social impact thus emerged from the recognition that there still tends to be a fair amount of trepidation when it comes to using tech effectively. This applies across a range of organizations small and large, young and mature despite leaders understanding the inherent potential tech displays in enhancing efficiency and enabling scale. The result is often that resources are squandered in expensive solutions that may not be the right fit. This impacts the organizations themselves, their funders, and most of all, the communities whom they serve.
The
Tech4Dev series
on IDR aims to change this. Its authors include funders, nonprofits, intermediary organizations, tech vendors; and, they come from within the Tech4Dev ecosystem, as well as those outside of it. And the pieces represent viewpoints that collectively advocate for a stronger tech ecosystem in the nonprofit space, one that nurtures a community of organizations using tech, and importantly, creates a space to share lessons learned. The series thus far has had a reach of around 700K, with 21k likes, comments, shares, and clicks. A few of the articles have also been translated into Hindi for
IDR Hindi.
The indirect reach is far greater given that two pieces were picked up by Times of India online, and IPS news. We are currently in the process of building out Year 2 of this series, so if you are interested in contributing to it, please
contact IDR.

2022 Recap – Year in Review
2022
– Well take a different approach to this report, always good to change things up. While we will focus a bit on Q4, well take this opportunity to reflect on the past 9 months since we started Tech4Dev 2.0, our evolution and growth and where we are headed. To summarize it in one sentence:
Its been an amazing year for us, a period where we truly have grown up, a great team in place and clear key objectives.
For the first time in a quarterly report, Ill switch to using a list of the top things that weve learned and/or accomplished in the past year in no specific order.
The Good Parts
Seeing the team grow from 0 to 9 in the course of this year has been fascinating. From a loosely coupled project growing to an experienced team driving things forward has helped speed things up. Truly grateful to our CEO
Erica Arya
and the early members who believed in us:
Siddanth Singh
,
Vinod Rajasekaran
and
Ankit Saxena
.
Our partnership with
Dasra
on legal and financial matters made our life easier and illustrates the value of collaboration and building on each other’s strengths.
The funding process we went through with
Omidyar Network
was brutal and exhausting, but so eye-opening. From a process perspective, we learned our strengths, and the myriad places where we need to get our act together. Again, our partnership with
Tariq
and the ON team showed the true power of collaboration. Both parties listened, but also pushed back if things seemed a bit too much.
Crossing paths with
The Agency Fund
, specifically
Robert
and
Temina
, and seeing how closely we intersect with what we want to do has been good. It’s awesome to have a sounding board with people who are doing similar stuff in an open and transparent manner. It’s also nice to have colleagues in SF, making me get out of the house!
Having more than 90% of our Tech4Dev 1.0 funders come back and fund Tech4Dev 2.0 at 2-3x  their previous level.  Their confidence and faith in our work, along with strong financial support, has made our life a lot easier. On a related note, hitting the 66% three-year fundraising goal for Tech4Dev 2.0 in the first three months of the funding cycle, also meant we could focus on execution rather than fundraising.  Deep gratitude and thanks to our funders for being generous and giving us multi-year grants.
Seeing Glific
grow and prosper
, validated our theory of self sustaining platforms. We
doubled our user base
(but fell short of our target), and tripled our revenue (exceeded our targets). Our
work with Gramhal
is likely to show the power of open source platforms developed for the public good, being deployed by state governments. This partnership is helping Glific scale to deliver thousands of messages per minute, which in turn benefits the larger ecosystem.
Our relationship with the Avni team has blossomed this year. Avnis
performance last year
similarly has also been quite amazing. As an external partner, we are seeing areas where we can help Avni strengthen their product offering. We are also seeing lots of commonalities in the areas of business development, sales, communication, customer service and finance. This year we plan to centralize these functions within Tech4Dev and get the efficiencies of scale as we deploy more platform solutions across the sector.
We had a good feeling about the Fractional CxO initiative. The response for this has been overwhelming and has far surpassed our expectations. Weve also been relatively fortunate to have been able to hire a team of experienced folks (
Vinod Rajasekaran
,
Ankit Saxena
,
Piyali Paul
,
Ashwin Srinivasan
) to help us pilot this initiative. Seems like well need to expand this group in Q1 2023 to keep up with demand.
We added
Nidhi Goyal
and made our advisory board official. Well be adding one more person to the board in 23. We have quarterly meetings focussed on strategy. A subset of the board meets on a weekly basis with an operational focus.
We had 5
in-person
sprints
(Gurgaon, Mumbai, GarudMaachi, Dehradun, Jaipur) this year. Super great to get people in the same space, helps with planning and team building. It also strengthens our remote working quite a bit.
The Not-so-Good Parts
Bringing us back to reality from all the good news, from a quality perspective, we need to step up our game with our platforms. We need to deliver higher quality products on time and we need to work with our NGOs as partners more than clients since we are jointly exploring and testing new things. Working in the social sector is not an excuse to deliver things late or of low quality. We have a fairly good reputation today, and we need to keep improving it.
Recruiting is always a challenge. Weve been surprised at our ability to recruit senior level talent to Tech4Dev. For most non-technical positions, weve been able to hire really good folks to the team. For the technical positions, we seem to be getting into the groove of connecting with the right folks. We do believe that we should pay good salaries to get great people.
We are learning how to interact with NGOs in an efficient manner at their pace. We seem to keep tweaking this on a monthly basis and are learning as we go. Things just seem to move much slower than wed like, but we have to be patient and understanding. We just wish folks are responsive and respectful of everyones time.
We are making headway amongst both foundations and NGOs on building high quality tools for the ecosystem rather than low quality custom solutions. However, most of our conversations with NGOs keep highlighting the prevalence and dissatisfaction with custom solutions. Not sure how we can fix this, do we continue throwing good money into a deeply invested project? How can we make ecosystem level changes?
Reflecting back and Looking ahead – Erica Arya
I started with Tech4Dev in India in March 2022, and have had strong support of the advisory group. Building the India team was the first big priority for me. I am incredibly grateful to our Tech4Dev network for being a key contributor in getting us the right folks to join the team. Our new team only reaffirms that if the right set of people come together it overall boosts the enthusiasm and energy levels which is so important in helping the organization achieve its mission.
Last year was a milestone year for us when we were entering into the second leg of Tech4Dev aka Tech4Dev 2.0:
Consolidating our learnings from phase one.
Scaling our chatbot platform – Glific from 40+ NGOs to 70+ NGOs
Gearing up to pilot two new initiatives that we strongly felt were a big need for the sector –
fractional CXO
(fCXO, tech and data professionals for social impact) and
Development Data Platform
(DDP, a platform to help NGOs analyze and visualize their program data ). Seeing
Glific
scale successfully in the year and fCXO and DDP bootstrap was a fulfilling experience.
It feels good to partner with NGOs and funders to pilot the fCXO and DDP initiatives. In the few months that we spent working on these initiatives the learnings had been immense and the hypothesis seemed mostly validated to take the initiatives beyond pilots. We opened up applications for the fCXO program, received good response both from funders and NGOs on their willingness to explore. We are currently in talks with close to 10 NGOs (big and medium sized) for the program and will engage with most of them this year. On DDP, we initiated a pilot with two NGO partners who will soon start working with more NGOs.
Another key focus area for us last year was strengthening our communication and marketing strategy. We wanted to increase the outreach of our programs for which we engaged with a communication agency and are hopeful to see positive outcomes this year.
The last year ended on a high note and we aim to continue to work with the renewed zest this year. With clear direction, enabling an ecosystem of foundations and NGO partners, our association with Dasra, a strong team, we will aggressively work on expanding the reach of our platforms and fCXO program so that we are able to impact more lives. This year we also plan to make our chatbot platform – Glific, go global. And as always Tech4Dev will continue to build, contribute and strengthen the ecosystem towards creating social impact!!

Vision
: A world with a
strong technology ecosystem powering
the social sector
Mission
: Build and support the ecosystem of
software, data and design companies, nonprofit partners, and foundations
working towards creating
social impact globally
2023 – Q2 Summary
Q2 2023 saw us evolve as an organisation. We set goals for both our
Technical
and
Executive
Committees, and also set
Metrics
for how we would evaluate ourselves. We formalised the first draft of our Vision and Mission statements above. We had a combined team meeting with
Dasra
in
Karjat
that helped both our groups learn more about each other. This has resulted in joint team field trips to
NGOs in Kutch
and
Pune
, a combined
Data and Learning program
being planned, and capacity building for individual NGOs. We did a deep dive into our fractional CXO work with
AktivAsia
and
CORO
and have a few new ideas on how to
structure our engagement
with NGOs, especially in the first month. In partnership with the
Code For GovTech
team, we have onboarded 11 amazing student interns across our platforms.
Highlights
Tech4Dev formed an
Executive Committee
this quarter to help us with governance and strategy. We have assembled a dream team with
Shilpa Kumar
,
Temina Madon
and
Kailash Nadh
, each of whom come with different perspectives and advice to the work we do.
We started the quarter with a
team sprint
at Karjat co-organised with Dasra. In addition to learning and strengthening the relationship with
Dasra
, each group within Tech4Dev reviewed their work and made plans for the next quarter. We also had
Agency Fund
and
GoalKeep
attend the sprint as part of our mission to build and collaborate with the ecosystem.
In our pursuit of building a data culture within NGOs to accelerate their impact by using data and tech as levers, we are collaborating with Dasra and organising a
cohort of NGOs on this
.
The Data Development platform is progressing at a good pace and is now transitioning from initial development phase to their 0.1 version launch in Q3. The Team has been involved in extensive piloting and have worked with 6 NGOs on a
proof of concept (PoC)
with the support of our partner,
Goalkeep
. Our long term focus is to make NGOs independent in managing their data pipelines.
Glific has achieved fair growth this quarter, with increased NGO onboarding,
feature launches
like
ChatGPT
, and
ticketing system
. Our emphasis is on NGO retention, and in this quarter we organised city meetups in
Bengaluru
and
Mumbai
to foster engagement and collaboration. 12+ NGOs attended the events. The results have been encouraging and we will hopefully continue with this.
Our Fractional CxO program with Reap Benefit is the first engagement that wrapped up this quarter. Excited for us to see the exit strategy executed for the NGO. We currently have 7 ongoing CxO engagements, supported by 3 full time and 3 part time fractional CxOs. Our focus is to enhance the structure of our engagements and implement processes, including high-level guides/playbooks, to provide improved support to NGOs in their engagements.
We have partnered with
Code for GovTech
(C4GT) to onboard student interns on Tech4Devs projects. We have 11
student interns
contributing to Glific and Avni.
Here
is a blog written by one of the students while working on Glific. The quality of students from the C4GT program has been very high.
Building on one of our focus areas of Data and Learning, we co-hosted sessions with
Nilekani Philanthropies
and
Atmas
NGOs for their grantees on Leveraging Technology for Social Impact.
As we continue to grow as an organisation, it is imperative for us to have internal processes and systems in place. We implemented few structural changes in the organisation. We continue to take support from Dasra and crafted some
guidelines
to support our employees better.
Misses
Our platforms – Glific and Avni continue to experience prolonged and sluggish sales cycles. We did an analysis on the Glific sales cycle and found that it takes
four to six months
for an NGO to make a decision regarding their onboarding onto the platform.
Looking inwards at the Fractional CxO program from the 1st year of experience and as the team grows, we see learnings for ourselves in building and improving our processes across the entire program from selection of NGOs, defining our engagement and actual engagement execution and delivery.
A key aspect of learning in our engagements has been to reinforce (to both NGOs and ourselves also) that technology is just an enabler; we have to first understand organisation dynamics and the program aspect of these organisations well before plunging into technology solutions.
Transitioning out of NGOs is still a work in progress and some of our long running engagements are well past what we had envisioned for us as a timeline; we are working on how best to evolve our strategy to transition out of our partners with still giving them the best chance of success at continuing the work done under the fCxO program.
People management is an area we need to work on and improve. We will work with an HR consultant to help us incorporate a review cadence, set expectations and improve communication with the team. One major learning for the leadership team is what is obvious to some of us, is not obvious to everyone, and we need to make things clear. Weve been working with the team in setting up a few
principles and guidelines
for the organisation.
Tech4Dev�s fCxO Program with Indus Action-
Ankit Saxena
Indus Action
(
IA
) works towards bridging the gap between policy and action by easing welfare access to vulnerable citizens. IAs vision is to consolidate India’s 500+ low-impact welfare schemes into 5-10 high-impact and accessible schemes, called the
PoWER
[Portfolio of Welfare & Entitlement Rights]. IAs goal is to support
1,000,000 families
with PoWER benefits by 2025.
IA has been leveraging tech to solve key challenges around welfare access. Last year, leadership observed that they were facing challenges around completing key tech projects. They also felt that there was an absence of a sound tech strategy that was aligned with their org strategy. With PoWER as a 2025 goal, tech became an even more of a key strategic lever for them. When IA got introduced to fCXO, they found it potentially addressing the tech challenges; they enrolled for the program & I was assigned as their fCXO.
My journey started with spending the first month doing deep conversations with different stakeholders within the organisation – the leadership and program teams (both leads and associates). Through these conversations I gained valuable insights into the different programs, their strategy, and challenges. This initial phase was crucial in developing a comprehensive understanding of the organisation. At the end of first month, I presented my assessment of the org challenges and priorities along with my planned approach to tackle them in the upcoming months.
As I delved deeper into the programs and engaged with team members, I realised that in most cases the root cause of the challenge was broken tech processes and an imbalance in tech team. Tech team didnt have the right number of project managers to effectively handle projects with the government. The critical role of product manager had not been considered by the org before. Developers were spread thin juggling between the development tasks and project management responsibilities. From a process perspective, there were significant gaps in aligning tech teams work with other departments, and important discussions happened verbally without proper documentation and tracking. To address all of these issues, I took immediate action by personally overseeing key projects, while simultaneously focusing on devising a long term tech strategy and improvements in tech processes.
So far, the journey has been both challenging and rewarding. We successfully implemented the first version of PoWER platform in Delhi. I am pleased that IA team has been very receptive to suggestions and changes proposed, making the progress smoother. To further strengthen the development and expansion of the project, we hired a skilled product manager who would drive the vision, strategy, and projects for PoWER. However, hiring and retaining a capable tech team remains a big challenge that I plan to address by having a combination of inhouse team and reliable vendors, thereby ensuring the project’s continued success.
Looking forward, my focus will be on developing an exit strategy for the fCXO program and transitioning out within the next few months. I am positive that with the system and process changes we have implemented and along with the tech strategy we have put in place, it has laid a solid foundation for IA to achieve its desired welfare outcomes. Technology will continue to play a vital role as an enabler in IAs journey and I feel confident that it is now well equipped to thrive even without the fCXO program

==================================================

Vision
: A world with a
strong technology ecosystem powering
the social sector
Mission
: Build and support the ecosystem of
software, data and design companies, nonprofit partners, and foundations
working towards creating
social impact globally
2023 – Q3 Summary
Really pleased with the direction and progress of Tech4Dev. Q3 2023 saw us hitting our stride in multiple areas both from a team and an ecosystem perspective. In addition to our normal quarterly sprints, we also saw multiple events hosted by our ecosystem partners, from the Social Impact Circles by Edzola, to the
Code4GovTech Summit
by Samagra and topped off with the
OASIS summit in Bangalore
by the newly formed
OASIS Network
.  Within Tech4Dev we started with the City Meetups for Glific, initiated the Glific bootcamp and were super thrilled to finally introduce
Dalgo – Data Platform
to the world. Our partnerships with Agency Fund, Dasra and GoalKeep solidified while we worked on the
Data Catalyst Projects
and we collaborated with Dasra on the
Bhansali Trust
project. Seems like we finally are tackling the
ecosystem
part of our mission and vision, which is super exciting. We continue to talk to more funders around the ecosystem, but for the next couple of years we need to focus on executing well and strengthening tech resilience amongst our partner NGOs.
Highlights
We had our
quarterly sprint
at Udaipur with the
Code4GovTech interns
joining us along with our partners
Dasra
,
GoalKeep
, and
Agency Fund
.
ON India
,
Empowerment Foundation
,
Nilekani Philanthropies
,
Cisco CSR
and
ATE Chandra
joined our list of funders.
To foster learning and a culture of community and collaboration, our upcoming sprint (15th Oct – 20th Oct at Kochi) will have 2 cohorts: one the
Data Catalyst
cohort and the second the
LLM cohort
– Generative AI (funded by our Cisco Grant) for which we have 5 NGOs joining in. We are experimenting with having family members join the sprint to make it easier and fun for our team members. Get in touch with us, if you are interested in attending and contributing to this sprint.
As part of growing up as an organisation, we have initiated a
quarterly goal-setting
exercise for the team. We have collaboratively outlined our goals for the next two quarters.
Our involvement via community events, field visits, and Tech4Dev awareness initiatives has led to an increase in leads. We participated in events such as the
OASIS Summit
,
C4GT
event and
EdZolas social impact circle
, celebrated milestones like Indus Action’s
10-year Summit
, and
field visits to Bhansali Trust
and
India Literacy Project
.
This quarter, our team has grown to 18 members as we welcome team members –
Rajeev Mohan
(fCxO),
Amisha Bisht
(Developer),
Amit Srivastava
(Finance),
Tejas Mahajan
(Product Manager), and
Sangeeta Mishra
(Customer Support).
To boost sales and to
encourage experimentation
with Glific, we have organised a Glific Bootcamp where
14 NGOs
have signed up to launch their chatbot with us. This quarter also marks a milestone when we onboarded our
100th Glific account.
The Dalgo team is super happy with the
official launch
of the product. Presently, the team is actively engaged with 4 projects (
SNEHA
,
STIR
,
SHRI
,
LAHI
) while 3 more projects are in the pipeline. We also organised an ‘
Intro to Dalgo’ webinar
.
With 2 new CxOs joining us, we are working on building the NGO pipeline; reviving old conversations and initiating new conversations with
Aangan Trust
, and
Social Compact – Dasra
. Please do introduce and recommend NGOs to this service as we want to see this grow significantly.
The
Avni sprint
in July saw projects made by non-core contributors
included in the platform
. Avni’s team also conducted field visits and did
2 releases
. The security hardening exercise is nearly complete with the aim of getting
security certification for govt deployments
.
Misses
All our platforms can benefit from predictable and shorter sales cycles. We continue to experiment with different ideas: City Meetups, Bootcamps, and Webinars with limited success. Our next hire has to  be someone who has experience in growing and managing a Software-as-a-Service business.
The past quarter, Avni focussed on strengthening the platform, while the Glific team redirected its energy on the Code4GovTech interns, which reduced platform development activities. Both projects also undertook a security audit and were busy fixing issues reported from it.
Weve been wanting to build an international presence for our platforms and CxO Initiatives. Weve not made significant progress on this, and will need to make this a priority this quarter. Let us know if you have any ideas on how we could push this forward.
We need to compensate people well, but at the same time incorporate the reality of the financial well-being of the sector. Our goal of building a sustainable entity will be challenging as we balance these competing options. We have to be creative to ensure we attract and retain high quality talent.
Introducing Dalgo: The Data Platform for Social Impact
In September 2023 we launched v.1.0 of
Dalgo
(formerly DDP), our open-source data platform for social impact organisations.
Dalgo enables nonprofits
to spend more time using their data for data informed decision-making and less on the repeated, resource-intensive, manual data consolidation efforts that they commonly struggle with.
Dalgo does this by automating data pipelines; bringing all your fragmented data from different data sources into a single data warehouse (owned by the NGO), then merging/cleaning/computing your data to create final datasets just the way you want them, and enabling you to connect and feed this data into your dashboards, mobile apps, or even generative AI models. You set up a daily/weekly frequency for this entire process then sit back and let the tech do all the work.
Dalgo mirrors a modern data stack found in the private sector with the added advantage of being tailored to meet the needs and goals of the development ecosystem. The Dalgo team has,  and will build data source connectors out for you if they dont already exist. These connectors have been made available as open-source components for anyone to use (Survey CTO, Kobo, Avni, Glific). We also understand the need for nonprofits to receive reliable and responsive support and prioritise this via
discord
and
documentation
.
Our earliest adopter,
SNEHA Mumbai
, transformed their data management practices with Dalgo, overcoming data fragmentation and inefficient manual transformations. They successfully democratised data access, automated reporting, and are unlocking valuable insights from their data. As a result,
SNEHA Mumbai
stands as a good example of how nonprofits can leverage data to enhance their impact and improve the lives of underserved communities.
All of our product development is led by NGO needs. Our early work with
SNEHA
,
STIR
,
SHRI
and
Dost Education
helped us get to v1.0. Our current/upcoming engagements with
TAP
,
KEF
,
Antarang
, and
LAHI
, alongside help from
Goalkeep
,
Agency Fund
and everyone reading this will help shape the product going forward. Were working towards some exciting developments in the next 6 months across data quality and governance, AI/ML, and platform UI/UX.
Now that weve built a respectable piece of engineering, were going to spend some time getting it into the hands of organisations who need it. Thats not to say that we wont be adding features – but we will be spending more time on outreach and consulting engagements, and on soliciting and processing the feedback we get from these conversations. The team is enthusiastic about this and weve already tweaked our work habits and project management to accommodate this change. Were looking forward to finding out what else our sector needs and how we can help them get there!

Vision
: A world with a
robust technology ecosystem powering
the social sector
Mission
: Build and support the ecosystem of
software, data, design companies, nonprofit partners, and foundations
working towards creating
social impact globally
2024 – Q1 Summary and Highlights
Writing this report from the mountains in California again, getting in a few more days of skiing before the end of the season. This quarter has included a lot of travel and my body feels on permanent jet lag. We had sprints happening in Goa (January), Naivasha – Kenya (February), and Bangalore (March) and unconferences in Nairobi and Bangalore. Our main focus on building the ecosystem is falling into place quite nicely with multiple partners from across the globe involved.
The first quarter continued our momentum from 2023. We refined the
Data Catalyst Program
with
Dasra
and Goalkeep building on our learnings with the first session. This resulted in a better experience for both the NGOs and the collaborative. The feedback from the participants was very encouraging and plans are afoot to run the next cohort in a few months.
Sprints and Unconferences
The sprint in Goa was our largest ever with approx 80+ participants over 9 days. This included the teams from Avni, Dalgo, Glific, and Fractional CxO. Glific had its largest-ever sprint with 15+ NGOs attending a packed 3-day schedule. In the spirit of community, we had a few
senior sprint veterans
from NGOs run many of the Glific sessions. These sprints are core to the mission and important to the community, but they are resource-intensive and tiring for the group. We will need to balance the larger sprints with a combination of smaller sprints and team gatherings only. More details in our blogs are here:
Community connections: The Apprentice Project’s experience of Glific sprint
A look back at Glific sprint in Goa, Jan 2024
We followed up the Goa sprint with another sprint and unconference in Kenya with our partners The Agency Fund with a very different format and our first foray into the global south. The Naivasha sprint was a 3-day event with a combination of Agency Fund grantees across Africa and India. Reminded me a lot of our first sprint in Tehri, where the main focus was bringing the community together and a fair amount of peer learning. It was very inspiring to see the work being done across the globe, the common problems that we are solving in our regions, and the power of open source and collaboration. The Nairobi unconference was an amazing trust-based collaborative that we managed to pull off in less than 4 weeks. We had around 100 folks from the Kenyan NGO and CBO ecosystem and realised how
similar the cultures and systems
are between Kenya and India (thanks to the colonial legacy bestowed on us).  More details from our team here.
Beyond Data, Beyond Borders- The Kenya UnConference
Sprinting Through Kenya: Collaboration, Learning, and Wildlife wonders
Kenya was followed by Dasra Philanthropy Week in India where we participated in events in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Interacted and learned in detail about the work done by the grassroots NGOs from the Empowerment Foundation Cohort. We had similar conversations later that week with NGOs that have a similar profile from Dasra’s Rebuild Cohort. Our current offerings and expertise are not a great match for the majority of these NGOs, but we do need to think about how we might be able to help them out going forward. At the other end of the spectrum, we also had quite in-depth conversations with larger NGOs where we are playing a more active and influential role. Did meet with a lot of folks whom I admire including Vanessa from SNEHA Mumbai, Safeena and Maharishi from Educate Girls, Gagan from Center for
Social Justice, Vishal and Sucheta from Dream a Dream, and others.
Marketing, New hires and NGO Satisfaction.
Our marketing team has been working hard over the past year. We recently unveiled a new logo and have been
very active on LinkedIn
which has helped us with outreach from both a sales and a hiring perspective. We get a steady stream of great engineering talent looking to switch to the social sector. If you are not following us on LinkedIn, do so
here
.
We also have a few new folks who joined our team: Gautam Prakash – Glific BizDev, Jerome White – AI/ML Lead, Anandu Pavanan, Akansha Sakhre – Glific Developers, Devi – fractional CxO, and Diana Gomes – Talent Management.
We got the results from a customer survey across all of Tech4Dev Platforms from
60 Decibels
. The results are quite interesting and give an overview of the impact of Tech4Dev. Across all our initiatives we got an NPS (Net Promoter Score) rating of 50, which is good, but we can and will do better. Many NGOs also feel that there are not too many affordable alternatives in this space, and Tech4Dev fills in that gap. However, the raw data is even more interesting since it allows us to dive into each of our platforms and initiatives and get insights into the products. Overall, we are offering a good service to NGOs with 74% of them reporting that their business has improved due to our platforms. Surprisingly, 50% of NGOs report they are using a service like Tech4Dev for the first time. You can see the report and data
here
.
Platforms and more
Our main platforms: Glific, Avni, and Dalgo are now all certified Digital Public Goods. We do want to build both user and partner communities around these platforms to ensure they are sustainable in the long run. We added a few new features in our platforms that we are proud of that we feel need to be mentioned in this report, they include
UI for Transformations
– Adding a no-code transformation layer to empower NGOs
WhatsApp Group Automation
– Personal Groups in WhatsApp + Glific – a match made in heaven
Auto Translate via LLMs
– Conversations in multiple languages? No problem, we can auto-translate!
Our fractional CxO program has now worked with 17 orgs since its inception. Our learnings over the past 18 months are nudging us in towards:
“When you partner with us, you partner with a team”
mentality and not one senior person to bring in expertise across multiple areas to the engagement. We are currently experimenting with the team model and plan to incorporate it across all engagements when successful.
As we expand our scope and goals, there are a few
key
positions where we want
your help to connect us
with the right folks. Most of our team has come in through our internal networks, so please keep those
referrals coming
(Vinod promises unlimited filter coffee as a referral bonus)
Head AI/LLM Engineer
– Someone to help pave the way for the whole new world we are exploring
Senior Engineering Director
– To meet the demand for fCxO especially those with strong engineering chops
Senior Data Scientist
– It is time for us to venture into the data science and engineering game
Head Business Development and Sales
– We need to dedicate resources to grow the business both in India and the Global South
In other news, our CEO Erica Arya was selected to be in the Okta Fellowship Cohort. We also received an emergency grant from Rati Forbes, Azim Premji Foundation, and Persistent Foundation for our Indian Entity. This money was needed to demonstrate a growth trajectory from a funding and distribution lens for the Indian entity. We feel that this will help us when we apply for our FCRA license. Grateful to these folks for helping us out when needed. We also had a meeting with Nandan Nilekani, a current funder, in a rapid-fire question-and-answer session, it was a fun experience, and we hope to get time on his calendar every year 🙂
Top-of-the-mind things that we kicked off this quarter include a CTO gathering in Bangalore on Apr 5, a writeup on this will come in our next report. We’ve also kickstarted the Tech4Dev 3.0 planning and strategy document which we will also share next quarter.
Misses
We’ve been doing fairly well from a fundraising perspective. However this quarter, we had two foundations who we’ve worked with closely over the past few months with our Fractional CxO vertical let us know that they will not be funding us. This is a bit disappointing primarily since they know us AND we demonstrated the value of what we do and how we do it. Sad that funders who see our work in action, are not convinced that funding the ecosystem at a broader level is a good investment.
Our newest platform on the block, Dalgo is going through its awkward early years. We have the basics of what’s needed out there for NGOs to use, however trying to figure out what to build next and why is proving to be a bit of a challenge. This will improve as we get more NGOs onboarded and they come in with their specific requests, but in the meantime, we’ve been floundering a wee bit. Erica and Lobo have stepped in to help bring focus and clarity to the team.
As our internal team has taken over the financial aspects of running Glific as a business, we’ve realised that collecting payments due from NGOs is a challenge. We recently made a concerted effort to collect all outstanding payments but will need to change our process so this does not become a chore. The goal is to automate the process by using an existing billing platform across all our platforms and services. This was on hold due to some regulatory changes made by the Indian regulatory agencies.
The team feels we can do better at our fCxO delivery to match our expectations. We’ve gotten pretty good reviews from our NGO partners, but we know we can do a lot better than what we are currently doing. Our NPS scores for the fCxO program have been 60+.
This year we will focus on improving our sustainability percentage for our platforms and fCxO initiatives. Last year this percentage decreased to 35% overall due to increased staffing. Our goal is to increase it to 45% this year. Balancing our pricing, staffing, and salary is not going to be easy.
Our fCxO pipeline continues to remain very strong and demand exceeds supply there. The other platforms: Avni, Glific, and Dalgo continue to see variable demand. We seem to be getting a better handle on this with Glific and will plan on implementing some of the things (webinars, boot camps, sprints, constant outreach) that worked for Glific in our other platforms.
Ensuring that we have a great culture and a super happy workforce is very important to us. In a recent survey, we recorded good ratings from most of the team. Our goal will be to get most of those ratings to be great (i.e. from satisfied to very satisfied) in the next feedback cycle.
We recently did our annual review cycle (we plan on doing this semi-annually) and this was a bit bumpy. We need to figure out how to normalise it across the entire team and ensure that folks have a clear idea of their goals and expectations and what the ratings and feedback mean.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: July 2022
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-2-0-sprints-are-off-the-starting-block-welcome-to-garudmaachi/
==================================================

From a developer perspective, logistics and event coordination is a bear and quite painful. Luckily for Tech4Dev, we have
Arun Kadekodi
from
Soft Corner
, who loves organizing events. He also knows the best places to organize a sprint in the Mumbai – Pune area, and he does not disappoint. The location of this sprint at
GarudMaachi
was quite amazing. We managed to time it right and hit it at peak rainy season, waterfalls galore, super green surroundings and more. On Monday it rained so much, that we are both awestruck and stuck indoors pretty much post lunch to end of day.
We’ll have a series of blog posts from various participants on the sprint. Arjun from
Avni
beat me to the first blog post that you can read here:
Tech4Dev 2.0: Glific + Avni Sprint
. Thanks to some seed funding from Cisco Foundation for the Education Cohort sprints, we will now have sprints on a quarterly basis for the Tech4Dev ecosystem.
We had 43 folks register for the event, with a significant number of them willing to pay their own way for accommodation and food. Due to Covid we expected a 10% cancellation rate, which did happen. We had 6 folks drop out at the last minute. We had a good mixture of NGOs (
Key Education Foundation
(KEF),
VOPA
,
The Apprentice Project
(TAP),
Slam Out Loud
,
Lend a Hand India
,
Reap Benefit
,
Shelter Associates
,
Avanti Fellows
, and
Indus Action
), Ecosystem Partners (
EdZola
,
Goalkeep
,
Avni
,
Glific
,
HyperVerge Academy
and
Dasra
). At some point we do hope to convince funders to attend the first couple of days of the sprint. We got pretty close this time, but ultimately it did not happen.
Opening Circle
Our tradition of folks getting their favorite treats from their place of origin continues to be the best part
While the event is a sprint in the traditional sense, our focus however is more on interactions, rest, recovery and enjoying the place a lot more than hands-on-keyboard. In my opening conversation, I did try to make this point to the group, and am glad to report that thanks to folks like Vinay Venu, Anand Sharma, Arun K the other activities including hiking (in a downpour), football (in the rain), card games and karoake are as important as the tech talks and blog posts.
A few learnings from this time for future sprints
We’ve gotten to a size where we need a coordinator to manage the logistics and communication for the event. While our teams have done a great job, its proving to be quite inefficient.
Charging all participants a small amount (INR 10K?) upfront might be a good way to minimize folks cancelling and/or changing plans.
Making the event family friendly is important (I think). This allows young parents to come with their kids and be present at least for some hours during the day. The coordinator will help manage and organize this.
To a large extent, I’ve been inspired by the
BMW Responsible Leaders gatherings
. While I dont think we can ever get to that level, I think the principle behind it:
It is good for all of us in the sector to take some time to reflect, interact, relax and enjoy. It is ok to spend money on ourselves.
So, we are grateful to our funders for allowing us to make this happen
We need to figure out what a good group size is. Seems like there is always more demand than space available, but maybe if we are doing it once per quarter, different NGOs will join us at different times
Taking inspiration from Tarun and Madhuri at Indus Action and their annual retreats, how can we bring folks from outside our network into such events. What do we need to do?
We should have a sick protocol (potentially a sick room if needed) and carry over the counter medications for mild sickness (see below for why!)
I realize the above has introduced more questions than answers, but we’ll figure it out and get better next time.
On a super sad note, I had to leave the sprint on Tuesday morning since I was feeling a bit under the weather since Monday. I figured it was good for me to try and keep the other folks safe. Super jealous that I’m not typing this blog post from GarudMaachi

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: May 2022
Category: Glific

==================================================

As with all things within Tech4Dev we attempt to document and publish everything that we do, our process, our thinking and sometimes the nitty gritty technical details. In that sense, this blog is way overdue, since we started the process a few months back but did not document or publish our journey. I’ll try and make up for it by covering what we’ve been upto the past few months in some detail.
Tech4Dev 1.0’s three year program and funding cycle officially completed on March 31, 2022. However due to decreased spending and focused activity during COVID, we still had some funding left over to help us continue the 1.0 work for another year. We felt we had good momentum, and we also wanted to involve other funders, specifically some of the larger foundations, and decided to kick off our 2.0 planning and fundraising in April. This was also good timing since we had
Erica Arya
start as India head, and we had
Aishwarya Geete
helping us with our communication material
Briefly for Tech4Dev 2.0, our mission is on strengthening the open-source technology ecosystem in the social sector. With 2.0, we plan to expand globally via the following focus areas:
Open source products and platforms: We’ll continue to invest in our existing platforms,
Glific
and
Avni
. We’ll also work on supporting existing platforms like
Aam Digital
and
CiviCRM
. This is a continuation of the work we started in Tech4Dev 1.0 and will be the primary focus on 2.0
Women-in-Tech Pilot: We are partnering with
Hyperverge Academy
to run programs in Tehri and Satara to work with young women in engineering colleges to expand and enhance their skillset.
Fractional CTO Pilot: We will work with a small group of NGOs and provide process and technology consulting using a shared services model.
Have a focus on responsible tech, security and privacy as a cross cutting theme across all the above areas. This is an important aspect of the work we do, since we know that our platforms and our NGO partners need to do a lot better with these issues.
For all the gory details, please do read the
Tech4Dev 2.0 Concept Note here
.
Our fundraising targets are equally ambitious with a goal of increasing our budget by 3x over the previous funding cycle. For this round, we are working hard to get more support from the funding community in India. We also have approximately 20% of our budget coming from earned revenues from our platforms and fractional CTO programs.
Our Journey so far
We started circulating the fundraising note in late March to some of our advisors. By mid April, we were comfortable with sharing the note with our existing funders and a few new funders. In super auspicious timing, we got grants at the same time from
The Agency Fund
and
Cisco
, which served as a strong vote of confidence for the work we are doing. Our work in India also got a great mention in GitHub’s summary on
open source in LMIC countries
. So from a momentum perspective, we were off to a flying start.
We got a really good response from our existing funders. Our ask from them was to double their 1.0 grant. Its great to see that we’ve had a majority of them commit to funding 2.0 at our requested amount. Makes things a lot easier when you have a group of folks who are willing to support you for extended periods of time. I mentioned to one of my friends that my 20+ year network is the best and most supportive ever. Truly grateful to our current set of funders and plan on bringing the new funders along on a long journey with us. My goal was to raise a majority of the funding for 2.0 in this quarter and we are on target to do so.
I do realize that I’m in a different place and position than most NGOs or Funders. Given that, I figured I might as well throw out a few suggestions both to my fellow funders and my fellow NGOs. Things that worked for us, and things that we could have done better
Thoughts for NGOs
Be shameless, Ask repeatedly: I got the most replies to my second round of emails which I sent approximately one week after my original ask. In general I repeat the email thrice before giving up.
Be persistent: One of our largest grants for this round was from a HNI who did not fund us in T4D 1.0. I kept them updated for the 13 reports (3 years) of the 1.0 cycle without a response. But I stuck with it. The long game worked for this funder and did not work with another funder (I’ll probably switch to sending this potential funder yearly reports now)
Be understanding: Most people mean well. The program person on the foundation side is trying to do their best under their constraints and responsibilities. They also understand and get it, but might not be able to make change internally within their organization. We are all in it to do good, thinking of it from the other person’s perspective helps a lot. As a recent example, the program manager really helped us work our story on how we are making an impact in the education sector, which enabled his team to then fund us.
Communicate often: For T4D 1.0, we sent out quarterly reports by the second week of the new quarter. Most of our funders did not read it, but we had in-depth conversations and discussions (and hence modifications) with the couple that did. More importantly, the reports helped us focus on things that went right, and things where we could have done better.
Accept the No gracefully: A few funders told us no fairly quickly. I totally respect, understand and accept that. I do ask them if they are interested in staying updated. Most of them gave us some explanation which did help things. But I think it is important to stay in touch if possible (communication is cheap), you never know how things will change in the next few years.
Finally, if you’ve met folks in person and if there are any things on your action item list for them or vice versa, a short email in 24 hours is totally worth it. It is good to keep the lines of communication open. Same goes for connections on Linked In. Follow up with folks when you say you will do it.
Thoughts for Funders
Be responsive: If there is one thing I could wave my magic wand, it would be on this. It’s ok to say no (with or without a reason). But spending a minute communicating in a timely manner makes it so much easier on all of us.
Be as open as possible: If it is highly unlikely or you’ve decided not to fund an organization, say so sooner rather than later. The NGO can decide if they want to build a relationship or it might not be a good use of their time right now. Saves a good amount of time on both sides. If you can give feedback, that would be even better and gives the NGO things to think about and potentially improve. At Glific, some of our funders have helped us focus significantly with their specific feedback and criticism.
Be generous: If you can help an NGO out by making an introduction, please do so. I’ve told folks in my network, I’ll let you know if you are making too many introductions, but I’ve never done it so far (and hopefully will never have to do it). This coupled with the above point, ensures that I’m spending my time wisely. Honestly, I learn a lot more from most NGO founders and get way more exposure to different aspects in these conversations.
Do your homework: We all our busy. It always better to do a pre-read on the material that NGOs have sent than get them to go thru their deck. We find discussions and deeper questions about the work, a lot more insightful.
Would love your feedback and comments. Feel free to reach out to us anytimeTitle: Tech4Dev 2.0 – Update on our Pilot Initiatives, Fundraising and Operations

==================================================

Seems like I write most of my blog posts and updates on flights to India. Writing this one as Im headed to India for our 4-week summer trip: a combination of family time and work during the second half of the trip. Hope to do a visit with at least one NGO and spend a few days on the ground with them.
Its been around 3 months since we actively started pitching the
Tech4Dev 2.0 Concept Note
and talking to our existing funders and lots of new ones. That note was quite detailed and focussed on folks who already knew our work and had a good understanding of the tech and data needs of NGOs. As we talk to new folks, we wanted to give them a higher-level view of the problem and our approach and created a pitch deck, which well be using as our presentation material going forward.
Since this is an update, Ill dive straight into what weve done and accomplished over the past 3 months
Our Fractional CxO (x == Tech, Data, or Tech Strategy) initiative has garnered the most interest amongst foundations. Seems like many of us have recognized this problem and we now have a potential solution. Weve got an existing pilot going with SNEHA Mumbai, and Erica and Vinod have shared an
update in this blog post
. We are also about to pilot this with Indus Action, Reap Benefit, and Suvita starting soon. We are excited to be working on this initiative in partnership with
Agency Fund
and will include their network in Africa and Latin America.
Our open-source platforms Avni, Glific, and Aam Digital continue to do well. We are working with more NGOs on larger consulting projects at state and national levels. Its been great to see the spike in interest for these platforms. We are now increasing staff on these projects to ensure we can deliver high-quality platforms.
The Cisco grant nudged us to focus on the education sector in a more profound manner. As part of this, we are organizing a sprint in
GarudMaachi
(80km from Pune) from July 3 – 8, to bring together a group of NGOs and our partners. Our goal is to open these events to more NGOs so we can build, share and learn from each other.
Our women-in-tech pilot is showing us the importance of running pilot programs. We are learning a lot and still trying to figure out what makes sense, when and how should we intervene, and who our target users are. We are also exploring the space in India and chatting with other NGOs doing similar work (so we can learn, build, or partner with them). An update on our
first pilot with Colored Cow and THDC is here
.
Weve strengthened our relationship with Dasra. Our goal is to more effectively manage the legal and financial process that supports the scale-up of Tech4Dev 2.0. Ninad Ankleshwaria from Dasra will be responsible for the grant management process
From a financial management perspective, we decided to start the Tech4Dev 2.0 clock on April 1, 2022. This allows us to cleanly wrap up the 1.0 cycle and transfer leftover funds from 1.0 into the 2.0 bucket.
From a funding perspective, our goal was to raise 7.5 million for the next 3 years. Our current funder base is super awesome, and weve had an 80% renewal rate at twice the 1.0 amount. We have committed funds for more than 75% of our 3-year target. Given the carry-over funds and revenues that we expect from 1.0, our overall 3-year budget is likely to be 10 – `11 million. We will be aggressive in hiring and growing the organization this year. Erica has been a super awesome addition, and we hope to add 3 more senior staff by the end of this year.Title: Tech4Dev 2.0: Avni – Glific Sprint

Kuldeep Lodha
from Shelter Associates shared about How Avni is helping them in their projects on Sanitation and Covid.
The talks were interspersed with deep work sessions where teams got a chance to work within themselves or with others they have been collaborating with.
The day ended with some games and karaoke session, getting to know fun sides of each other and some hidden talents!
All along the day the group was accompanied with heavy rains and lush green surroundings ????
This is a beautiful get-together of like-minded professionals from different orgs working on societal problems using technology.
Especially for Avni team this provides an opportunity to be spending time and working in-person, some of the team members are meeting for the first time.Title: Tech4Dev 2019 Application Update 1
Author: Kurund Jalmi

Category: Tech4Dev project Updates

==================================================

We closed the Tech4Dev Application Process for the second cohort a few weeks ago. We were a bit busy with
fundraising for Tech4Dev
and hence the slight delay in analysis of this years application.
We advertised the Tech4Dev application using the same process as previous years.
GuideStar India
and
IDR Online
are places where we got significant exposure. This year we were also picked up by two other sites:
NGOBOX
and
Funds for NGOs
which gave us some more exposure. We received a total of 137 applications for the second cohort. Our referral data (after some cleanup) shows the following distribution:
The application submission count over time is another interesting metric to look at. There are a couple of bumps at various spots, with a big bump close to the last date. It seems a bit smoother in this cycle compared to our first cohort
The size of the organizations also has a slightly more even distribution this time around. Most of the orgs lie within the 25L – 1 CR range, but there is a solid group of orgs above the 1 CR range
Similar to the first cohort, only 12.5% of the organizations had approached anothe software vendor and received a proposal from them.
This year, we’ve split the application into two stages. The first application is a short application and our goal was to ask approx 25% of the organizations to fill a more detailed second round application. We’ve done some preliminary filtering and broken the organizations into six groups as follows:
Second Round
– Invite the organization for a more detailed second round application
Reject 1
– Did not give us sufficient information
Reject 2
– Is not a good fit for Tech4Dev
Reject 3
– Application was too broad and covered too many areas
Reject 4
– We had worked with them in a prior cohort. This was our fault, since we did not make it clear that they should not apply
Reject 5, 6
– This is specific to farmers and MFI. This is a area where we do not have the required skills but do intend building the skill set by recruiting software partners in those areas as soon as we can find them.
So we’ve ended up with 34 organizations for the second round. We’ve categorized those orgs into various sectors from a tech perspective:
This is the state of things today. We’ll definitely go back and tweak a few things before sending out email to the organizations and letting them know. Overall, we do think we have a good set of potential NGOs and platforms to build for the sectorTitle: Tech4Dev Application Results

==================================================

The process was a lot harder than we expected. The decisions a lot more difficult to make. It was really awesome to see and hear from the applicants. The quality and depth of the work people are doing in the sector is strong, deep and very thoughtful. We asked for permission from the organizations below to publish their responses. Please do read and comment on the applications. Without further ado, the winners are (in alphabetical order)
Winners
ANARDE Foundation(ACIL Navsarjan Rural Development Foundation)
HAQ: Centre for Child Rights
Hasiru Dala
Indus Action Initiatives
Lakeer Foundation
M.B Barvalia Foundation Spandan holistic mother and child care hospital
Reading Class Project
Resource Centre for Interventions on Violence Against Women, Tata Institute of Social Sciences
Waitlist
Bridges of Sports Foundation
Ghaswala Vision Foundation
We split all the finalists into 3 groups and a couple of us spent approx 45 minutes with each finalist. We then wrote up our thoughts and final ranking and discussed them on a conference call. Our
initial application call
proposed that we would support 4 NGOs. We found it impossible to turn away organizations doing such great work with such focused and specific needs. So we’ve expanded our initiative to accept 8 organizations and have 2 on the waitlist. A few words on common characteristics between the selected organizations:
They were very specific in their proposal and their interview
They had very strong reasons as to why this project was important to the organization and how it will help them programmatically
They had a good sense and commitment to do what will be needed after the grant is over to keep the project going strong, improving and funded within the organization.
The work that we would do for them has a good possibility of being used for some other NGOs as well, with minor tweaks
From a demographic viewpoint, we had a combination of both old (20+ years old) and new (1 year old) organizations. We also had organizations with very small budgets (INR 2L) to organizations with large budgets (INR 7CR) and across multiple sectors: Health, Governance, Education, Women Empowerment, Sports
To make the above happen, we are now fundraising within and outside our network to raise the additional funds. So yes, we do know the joy and hardship of trying to raise funds for projects that you are passionate about. As always, if you are a funder, please
get in touch with us
.
We’ll start work with some of the winners in December and the rest shortly thereafter. We’ll keep you updated on a monthly basis, if not more frequently.
Thank you for  reading this and being part of our journey.Title: Tech4Dev Application Update 2

Happy Diwali! Hope you had a good holiday and a nice break. In the meantime, we’ve been hard at work on reading and responding to the applications in the Tech4Dev Project. Here is the latest status on the Tech4Dev Application Process.
A couple of weeks ago, we informed 53 organizations that their application was not being considered further in this cycle. There were a few reasons behind that decision:
The application form and information provided was incomplete – 32
The application was not clear on the exact scope of the project or assistance required, and thus we could not decide if we could undertake the project or not – 13
We did not have the skill set or were not sure of the role played by the tech project in the overall impact being created by the organization – 8
This left us with 28 remaining applications. We asked for additional information from a few of the organizations to ensure we understood the application and their needs better. The decision committee was composed of Prapti Patel from Dasra, Arun Kadekodi from Soft Corner, Kurund Jalmi from Web Access and Lobo from Chintu Gudiya Foundation. Each application was reviewed by at least 2 people. We scored each application on 5 factors:
Impact
– How impactful was the work being done by the organization, how vulnerable the beneficiary group or geography of operation was, whether the organization would be able to find another tech provider to help them, etc
Importance
– How important/ necessary/ crucial to the organizational impact was the project which required tech assistance/ how many degrees of separation lay between the overall impact of the organization or the program and the tech needs
Reusable
– How reusable would the final tool created be/ how many other organizations might have similar needs or requirements for their own programs
Skill Set Match
– From a skills perspective, can we do justice to the tool to be created/ tech assistance to be provided, can we actually add value to the organization given the skill set our team has
Prior work
– Have we worked on a similar project with other organizations in the past, thus reducing the amount of time and effort required, freeing up resources to help more organizations
After each application was individually rated by 2 people, we discussed each application among all 4 of us and then categorized each application in 2 buckets: Interview and Others.
Overall, we were super impressed with the quality of each application and it was tough to decide. In the end, we selected 14 applications to take forward into the interview stage. We will start the interviews next week.
We do think there is a screaming need for help and assistance in developing software tools for nonprofit?s projects. To try and support more organizations, we are going to reach out to our network and see if we can double (or even triple!) our support.

==================================================

A brief update and next steps on the
Project
Tech4Dev
Application.
We just closed the application process earlier this week. We received a total of 81 applications. We sent out our first emails on Sept 20, 2018, and closed the application process on October 21, 2018 (at approx midnight Eastern Standard Time). We allowed one late application due to an error. We received a steady stream of applications during the period as the chart below illustrates
We received our first application approximately 3 days after the first email. We received 12 applications on the last day and  25 applications in the last 3 days.
The two spikes in the above graph most likely were due to a mailing by our friends
India Development Review
and
Guidestar India
.
We wanted to keep the application as simple as possible, so we did not ask too many questions about the organization. The closest proxy to the size of the organization was the budget. More than half of the organizations that applied had a budget of less than 1 CR
Finally, only 12.3% of the organizations mentioned that they are working with a software company, which seems a bit low. Maybe, we did not phrase this question correctly.
A few quick notes of the quality of the applications
A third of the applications gave us very limited information. The long answers for the three questions for these applications were just a couple of sentences long. As such we will not consider these applications since we do not have enough information to make a decision.
We went back to 10% of the organizations and asked them to give us more detailed information to make the application complete. We will incorporate this information when reviewing their applications.
Most of the above applications with minimal information were submitted in the first half of the application period. Applications submitted in the last week of the application process seemed to have a fair amount of information. The below graph illustrates that many of the shortlisted applications were submitted in the last week.
At a brief glance, we are very impressed with the quality and depth of the applications. We suspected there was a big need for a service like this, but are surprised at the scale of this need. This also means we need to figure out how we can serve more non-profits in a better and more efficient manner.
Here are the next steps as we see them:
We will send out a thank you email to all the applications. We will also send out our first round of emails to organizations that did not give us enough information to make a decision.
There are some applications where we do not have the relevant skill sets and/or the project scope is significantly larger than we can handle and/or their budget exceeds our 10 CR limit. We will communicate the same to these organizations. This is approximately 20% of the remaining organizations.
Next, we will go through the remaining applications and have an email discussion and clarification with most of the remaining applicants. We expect to have approximately 25 applicants at this stage
We will evaluate the remaining applications across the following factors
How much of an impact it has on the programs run by the organization?
How important is the project to the organization?
Can we reuse the work done and apply it to other organizations in the spirit of open source?
Do we have the required skill sets in our partner ecosystem to complete the project successfully
Can we build on existing open source projects or some of our past work to meet the needs of the organization?
Can we group this organization with other organizations in the process having similar needs?
We will try and be as transparent as possible during the process. We will post periodic updates on this blog.

This blog is written by Rahul, from
VOPA
As a VOPA Team Member, I explore this place from educational eye sight. I went to Dehradun one day early, so it was a good opportunity for me to reach out to maximum places near this Cohort. Mussoorie, the place that I loved ever, It Shows the British Colonial legacy and building Structure Also.
Then I walked to more steps at Mall Road, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar showed this Education Cohort Path through his Vision-
Educate, Unite & Fight.
This Place is Amazing for Flora Fauna- i saw Burans Tree there.
Read this Info Also –
Now Coming the Actual Sprint,
On Day One: Tejas Organises People through his ice-breaking activity. What is in your mind? What should be your dream about this Cohort? People Enjoy this Small Activity-
Gram Vaani : We are living in Two Countries – Bharat & India. For Bharat, we faced lots of issues regarding Basic education. Gramvani works for Bharat. through his Product, I knew how to implement Audio for Case solving and help people with decision making. It’s a really helpful tool for society
Rishi from
Quest Alliance
shared their Journey of
Glific
WhatsApp Chat Bot. An interesting & informal Chat flow creates mindfulness among the children, that was my best learning from Rishi.
After that
Vandna from
Bhumi
shared her work experience about how they help people through field activity & their volunteer-oriented leadership Program. It was very motivating to encourage people and get them Large Scale on-field output.
After lunch Tech4dev team initiated the next level talk with
Mr.Sebastian Leidig
from
Aam Digital
. He designed a wonderful school management Web-App called-
Aam Digital
. He is from Germany and thinks about Indian School! When we walked on the Dehradun roads that time I realized how Sebastian Positively thinks beyond Boundaries. He is Part of that historical Berlin wall
SNEHA
is the Big Foundation. They present their data management System in their Tech Talk. Nadeem, and Vinita Shared their technical workflow and how they ensure their data Backup-Safety-Day to day Reports and all. Large Scale data handling will be more effective with these tools.
As we know most of the women did not ask and report their issues. If they needed help, most of the time they were helpless. For this need, Aparna from Suno-Sunao initiated an Audio Based Chat Bot with the use of
Glific
Support. Women just record the question and send that to BOT, the follow-up Happened, for our country, this will change a lot
Tech4Dev
also initiated the Core technical work with the NGOs.
IDInsight
shows their work in tech talk. Jeenu and David explain how their data management tool will help another NGO. for the Scale Impact Analysis we can collaborate with him. After that, I discussed with him how their tech will have exposure in India. David is from Kenya and he is a very cool guy, an interesting finding that in their home place- the air conditioner fools us 🙂
Aparna & Naveli from
STiR Education
Participated in tech Talks, their work is amazing with the teachers. Changing teachers’ behavior is a huge and high tens of tasks that they did.
Win-Win 🙂
In the end, all the Talk and group work is very helpful for all of us. It opens a new roadmap beyond the culture and beyond the boundaries. My soul is now full of heavy collaboration. Also, we get good help from Tejas, in kind of content making in VOPAs V-School App.
Reap Benefit
‘s Tejas and Gautam had taken a good advantage of
Glific
support. they used Location based issues reporting to Corporator, it will create large-scale people movement. Tejas is now GrandMaster Go-Go for all of us 🙂
I feel a win-win situation, thank u team tech4dev & Erica mam, who organize this Amazing Cohort and beautiful Place.
Thank you all. Feel Free to reach out me: rahul.bngr@gmail.com.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: January 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-goals-for-2020/
==================================================

As we begin 2020, it would be good to think and reflect back on what we accomplished in 2019 and plan on a few ambitious goals for 2020.
You can read about our 2019 accomplishments in our Q4 report
here
. Briefly, we are proud of our 2019 accomplishments, a sampling of which are listed here:
We surpassed our goals of NGO projects, software partners and funding by a significant margin in all cases.
Our experience in 2019 has helped us develop a good idea of how to work effectively with various types of organizations
We are on track from an open-source software platform perspective with
Avni
,
Kobo
,
Primero
. We are also working on designing and building a
“people management” platform
that we can customize for multiple NGOs
We have built partnerships with multiple players in the Indian social sector – NGOs, funders and intermediaries.
I would classify our 2020 goals into two different sections. The first section is devoted to operational goals and specific targets that we’d like to achieve:
Work with at least 50 NGOs in 2020. To that end, we’re keeping our application open year-round. We will review applications at the end of each month and start projects as other projects complete.
Start adopting a User-centered design approach and make usability and design a key value proposition. We are definitely lacking in this area today.
Recruit 5 more software partners across India, ideally in cities where we currently don’t have a presence. I suspect that this will be our biggest challenge.
Hit our “Series A” fundraising goals for the 3 year period ending on Dec 31, 2021, i.e. raise $3 million. Lay the groundwork for our “Series B” funding round. We expect this to be 2-3x larger than our “Series A” round.
New name for Tech4Dev (it’s a commonly used term). Establish a non-profit entity in India for Tech4Dev and register for 12A, 80G and FCRA.
From a larger vision and thinking big perspective, a few ideas, and thoughts:
My biggest lesson from 2019: One of our main priorities should be to educate funders and foundations to do a few things, specifically on the software side of things:
Be transparent about their work and publish the work they do and support.
Open Source all their work.
Research before they build.
Collaborate with fellow funders and foundations on shared goals.
Building on the first point, we would love for Tech4Dev to have greater ownership by entities in India. Getting one of the larger funders/foundations in India, collaborating and building Tech4Dev with us, would be super awesome.
We would like the open-source solutions that have been built under Tech4Dev to be used widely by NGOs. As a step in these directions, we would like to support the Avni project to a state where an NGO with some in-house tech resources can install and use Avni on its own. This would necessitate the building of a strong development and support community for this product.
Charge NGOs a percentage of the total cost of the project – around 25%. This would increase the NGOs’ ownership of the project and cover part of our expenses, thus reducing our dependence on grants going forward. For larger NGOs, we will make them responsible for all the project costs because their greater need is often technical expertise rather than funding.Title: Tech4Dev Internal Meet and DDP Sprint – Recollections and reflections

==================================================

This blog is written by Vinod Rajasekaran, Fractional CxO at
SNEHA
through Tech4Dev and works on the Data Development Platform
Sitting in sweltering, bustling Chennai writing this blog post, the calmness of the forest and camaraderie of the community at the
Tech4Dev
internal meet and sprint seems a universe away. A lot of firsts for me over the last week – my first face-to-face meeting with colleagues at
Tech4Dev
, my first Data Development Platform sprint, my first development sector community meeting with NGOs, and more…
The first two days were a blur with meeting the
Tech4Dev
team face-to-face after all the Meet calls over the last 4 months. It was nice to interact in person with Lobo and Erica especially after having interacted so much on video calls over the previous months. Super cool to hear the history of Tech4Dev 1.0 from Lobo, Arun, Arjav, Kurund, and Arjun! Spent a lot of time with Ankit (also my roomie for the sprint) who is the other Fractional CxO currently at Tech4Dev working with
Indus Action
and
Reap Benefit
.
The next few days were an interesting mix of DDP sprint work and conversations with the community at the sprint. Being new to the development sector, one of my goals was to talk to as many folks as possible and get a broad sense of the work being done. I came away with a lot of awe at the passion and amazing work being done by the folks at the sprint. Also, got to meet Nadeem and Vinitha from
SNEHA
who I have been working remotely since late May.
Abhideep from Gramvaani
A couple of conversations that stood out for me:
GramVaani
and the power of community radio in the Indian context – have always loved seeing the power of community radio during my time in the US and hearing about GramVaani from Abhideep was very uplifting. The other conversation I had that really made me go back and do some research was with Gautam Prakash and Tejas Mahajan from
Reap Benefit
. I was quite a skeptic of the scaling of Reap Benefits Civic Action endeavors until they talked to me about the 3.5% rule (Reference:
The 3.5% rule: How a small minority can change the world
). I had never heard about this and was pleasantly surprised that a small involved population segment can influence the path of society. The jury is out on this but I have moved a bit towards the Reap Benefits side of the fence ????
The first day of the DDP sprint with hands-on participation from Tech4Dev,
IDinsight
,
Dhwani
,
Aam Digital
,
SNEHA
was a tough one – the Wi-Fi problems coupled with issues with previous connectors on ELT tool Airbyte made for a tough start. We circled back, reduced our goal set, and got things going to achieve a couple of goals we had laid out before the sprint- try out Apache Superset as a visualization tool and get feedback on how easy it would be for folks at the NGOs as a replacement for existing visualization tools and also a proof of concept data pipeline going from data in SurveyCTO to visualizations in Apache Superset using Airbyte and PostgreSQL as the middle layers.
Learnings from the DDP Sprint include – easy-to-make connectors on Airbyte for data sources once you understand the process which is quite well documented (a few hours of work to get a primitive connector going – sprint developer); Apache Superset was easy to work with for the SNEHA team coming from a Tableau background; reconfigure future sprint sessions and work to be more broken down into tasks and have much longer 4-hour sessions instead of our current 2.5-hour sessions.
Overall an exciting start for DDP and excited to push this further along in our next pilots with a couple of NGOs and get a few more learnings on the platform.
Some memorable moments outside of work – Glific team members (especially one that shalt not be named) intensity with the Exploding Kittens game, Lobo and me bonding over the lack of good coffee on the first two days, the quick jaunt to Mussoorie that was more of musical Antakshari in the back of the bus and conversations all around. Looking forward to the next sprint and continuing the conversations from this one!Title: Tech4Dev NGO Feedback
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: August 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-ngo-feedback/
==================================================

Lobo and I met three of the 2018 Tech4Dev grantees last week (the week of June 2nd ). The meetings were for getting feedback on their experience within the Tech4Dev collaborative, in general, as well as on their experience with their respective software partners. All three meetings were kept to around thirty minutes and were kept informal and conversational. All of the grantees were sent a list of questions the day before; however, the questions were to serve as a guide to thought and not a list to compulsorily stick to.
We met two grantees ? Anarde and Toy Bank in Mahim and the third, TISS, in Sion (after some running around to find the correct Caf? Coffee Day; apparently there are three very close to each other!). All three shared great feedback on the solutions the software partners are building for them, on the nature of the interactions, and on the whole Tech4Dev experience. While they were satisfied with the solutions being built, there were a few insights that could greatly enhance the process, going forward:
Communication is key. The initial communication between the grantees and the software partners has scope for improvement. There were a few instances of lack of clarity on timelines and a period of silence between conversations that the grantees felt could have been avoided. A weekly update call or email between the grantee and the software partner would be a good starting point.
It is necessary to have very clear role definitions and articulation of responsibilities between the grantee and the software partner at the start of the project. This will enhance co-working towards the solution.
Grantees and software partners could do with more research on each other before even the first meeting. Grantees could be provided with references to past similar work done by software partners, other organizations for whom they have built solutions, and a general list of capabilities. Software partners could try and understand what the grantees do, what they believe in, what impact the grantee interventions are expected to lead to, by exploring the grantee websites or even talking to the grantees about their work before starting conversations on requirements and solution needs.
There can be a difference in perspective between the grantees and software partners that needs to be understood and navigated through with sensitivity. Both need to be aware that while the grantees often think in terms of sensitivity to the cause and even ideology, software partners often come with a systems and processes mindset.
There can be more ways of the grantee cohorts to know about each other and about each other?s work. Also, in case of shared software partners, would be a good idea to have a channel of communication between grantees too.
While the software partners build solutions for grantees, the grantees themselves would like to be more tech-savvy not just when interacting with the Tech4Dev partners, but also otherwise, when interacting with or engaging other IT vendors in the future. Some hand-holding or support by Tech4Dev in building this tech-savviness would be appreciated. While there were other operational points of feedback, they were mostly contextual to the grantee and to the solution being built. The overall points above can be considered for generally enhancing the Tech4Dev experience.Title: Tech4Dev Project Implementation Process
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: March 2020
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-project-implementation-process/
==================================================

Here is the process that we typically use for any Tech4Dev project and we are following the same for the Medha STPC project.
Prepare a scope document based on the project proposal that is submitted by NGO to Tech4Dev and after discussions with the NGO.
Once the scope is agreed by NGO, we create a detailed project plan document explaining project functionality, timeline, cost, technologies, etc for the implementation.
Typically a project is divided into multiple milestones to make it easier to track the progress of the project.
Workflow mockups and UI designs are created and shared with the NGO before any development work.
Once development starts we schedule weekly status update calls with the NGO. This call will also include a demo of the functionality that is being worked. A meeting document is maintained to capture all the interactions which can be updated by both the parties.
We will also share the staging server instance once the project is in working condition. NGOs can use this to provide their feedback.
All the code and the documents related to the project are shared with the NGO right from the beginning of the project. NGO can also track the development of the public Github repo. The documents are stored on a google drive folder which is shared with the NGO (and also open for viewing by the world)
A final acceptance test is performed by the NGO on the completion of all the milestones. After that, we will deploy the project on NGO?s production server and/or recommend a hosting solution and transition the project to the NGO team.
Questions, Comments and/or suggestions are welcome.Title: Tech4Dev Project Report #1 – April 2019
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-project-report-april-2019/
==================================================

Welcome to our first project report for Tech4Dev. The goal is to keep it short and sweet, highlighting many of our successes and areas where we can improve. A lot more information can be found on the blog post links at the bottom of each report. Our plan is to issue these reports twice a year – in April and October.
Highlights
In the first half of the year, we started work with 8 NGOs. We deferred 3 NGOs to later in the year due to capacity constraints. The software partners rose up to the challenge and are working on multiple projects at the same time. We completed two projects, canceled one project and the remaining are in progress.
Fundraising has been very good in the US. We?ve raised 90% of our target for the US
We recruited 3 new software partners (Maverick Labs, Dhwani and CivicDataLab), a marketing and strategy partner (Lumen Consulting), a foundation/incubator in the first quarter (Social Alpha), and an individual (Sanjeev Dharap) to help with operations. Dasra is our financial partner and plays a key role in fiscal management.
We had our first team meeting in Bangalore on April 15, 16 with all our partners. It was great for us to meet and share our experiences and challenges. We made good progress on governance issues and NGO application processes.
Our project pipeline is strong and deep. We reached into our pool of applicants and chose a few new ones to get our new software partners started.
We are on track to exceed the number of partners and projects for this year.
Misses
We canceled 1 project and had to defer on 2 projects. We could have avoided these issues by a better screening process. Our future application process improves on this by asking specific financial questions and with in-person interviews before selection.
Gender diversity in the team is very skewed. We need to proactively address this with our next few software partners.
Our Indian fundraising efforts are slow going. We are still building our network with funders in India. To help people understand our mission, we?ve created a
2 page
brochure describing our work and will keep refining it as we engage with funders.
We need to have better tools and tracking processes to deal with multiple projects and partners. There are a few too many moving parts at the same time right now.

Building the Open-Source Technology Ecosystem for the Social Sector.

Summary
2021
has been a roller coaster ride that does not seem to end in some parts of the world. While the US seems to have returned to regular life, Q2 2021 impacted both urban and rural India harshly. A significant percentage of personnel from both our NGO and software partner networks were directly or indirectly impacted by COVID. This led to our slowest quarter since our inception from an outreach and deployment perspective.
We continue our focus on our open-source platforms.
FundImpact
(FI), our platform that helps social organizations track project funds, deliverables, and impact on the ground.
Dhwani RIS
has been working with NGOs like
Pradan
,
Shelter Associates
,
Medha
to extend FI to their needs.
Glific
has continued onboarding more NGOs onto the platform. We onboarded 4 NGOs this quarter, and we hope to onboard a few more as the pandemic in India recedes. As of June, we have
24 NGOs
on the platform. We work closely with our partner NGOs in extending the platform to meet their needs. The case study in this report shows how one of our partners served their community and network effectively via Glific.
Highlights and Misses
Our work with Internet Freedom Foundation and Civic Data Lab in open data
helped in the Supreme Court decision
that issued notice & directed the Union of India to investigate why IT Act Sec 66A cases are still being registered and file a counter-affidavit within 2 weeks.
Glific
v1.8 was released in early July. A new version of the
Glific Product Video
along with other videos is available on
our youtube channel
.
Glifics consulting practice started in Q2 2021. We are working with multiple NGOs to meet their specific requirements, like
Digital Green to build an audio chatbot
.
Our financials are in a good state due to reduced expenses in the past 15 months. This will enable our current funding to support us for an additional year.
Tech4Devs fifth cohort was held during Q2, 2021 at the height of the pandemic. Some of the NGOs selected during this cohort had to withdraw due to pandemic issues.
Our three open-source platforms: Avni, FundImpact, and Glific had a slow quarter in onboarding new NGOs. We also refrained from actively marketing to NGOs in Q2 2021, due to the impact of the pandemic on their staff and other higher priorities.
We welcome Ravi Dronamraju into our funding circle.
Glific Case Study – Reap Benefit
Reap Benefit is one of the leading NGOs that have really used the WhatsApp chatbot system to great advantage. We have been interacting and learning from them as much as we can so as to provide leverage to other NGOs from the good things they have been able to do. In the past 6 months, they have reached out to 40,000+ beneficiaries, exchanging 1m+ messages. Along with a good testament to the Glific platform, its a bigger testament to the program delivery problem we had set out to solve for the social sector.
Glific has provided a really simple, customizable tool to meet most of our use cases, said Gauthamraj, chatbot program lead at Reap Benefit. This is a big achievement for us. Were planning to onboard 50K more citizens” he said, sharing their near future plans. The Reap Benefit team has been able to make 2X improvements in their programs with Glific as compared to other competitive solutions used in the past. The biggest benefit to them has been the ability to customize the platform such as when they built Google Sheets integration with Glific to serve COVID-affected families. These implementations further validate features that we should make available to a larger set of NGOs, making Glific a go-to choice.
It’s been a bit more than a year since the pandemic, and our decision to devote most of our energy and resources to our open-source platforms, Glific and FundImpact. In retrospect, this was the right decision, and well spend some time reflecting on what worked and what did not. So a random, semi-structured walk of our journey in the past year.

Summary
Q3 2021
seemed to be the first baby steps of the world getting back on track.  With the vaccine rollout happening at a fairly quick pace across both India and the US, things seemed to be coming back to normal. We ended the quarter with a trip back to India where I met the Glific and ColoredCow teams for the first time and caught up with some of our Tech4Dev partners.
Glific
continues to be our main focal point over the past quarter. While we missed our target with regard to the number of new NGOs on the system, we significantly overshot our consulting revenue targets working with some stellar NGOs including Digital Green & STiR Education. This enabled us to strengthen and extend the platform and give us lots of good feature ideas. From a revenue and sustainability perspective, Glific is exceeding its target, and our goal is to close 2021 with at least 30% sustainability for the year. We continue to have regular webinars with our software partners to attract new customers.
FundImpact
(FI), our platform that helps social organizations track project funds, deliverables, and impact on the ground has proven to be a bit more challenging from a sales and marketing perspective. The overlap between FI and Dhwanis Grant Management System is significant, and we are evaluating if it makes sense to merge the two products. In the meantime,
Dhwani RIS
has been working with NGOs like
Pradan
,
Shelter Associates
,
Medha
to extend FI to their needs and is in the process of releasing v2.0 of the platform.
From a partner perspective, we have been working closely with the Avanti Fellows & Plio team: sharing knowledge and expertise with them based on our experiences with Glific. Weve started a series of bi-monthly tech talks where we dive deeply into one specific product or technology. In the past quarter weve had talks on Glific, Plio, Avni and Sunbird.
Financially we are in a good position, thanks to reduced expenditures and our focus on building sustainable platforms. Our current financial balance and commitments is projected to carry us till the end of 2022. This cushion has enabled us to focus on product and sustainability and allowed us to take a break from fundraising.
After two years, we will
be meeting face-to-face at a weeklong open source social impact sprint
in Nov in Uttarakhand with Tech4Dev software partners. The main goal is to build community and to give the product folks a time and place to gather together and share their learnings in-person.
Highlights and Misses
In the short span of 15 months, Glific has gone from being an idea to becoming a
Global Digital Public Good.
The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative (endorsed by the UN and spearheaded by Norway & Unicef) with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.
The past quarter, both Glific and FundImpact have worked with relatively large NGOs on significant projects deploying these platforms. Weve realized that working closely with an NGO partner(s) helps create a laser-like focus on functionality and deliverables, resulting in a better product.
Our goal is to make our platforms sustainable in 3-5 years from inception. In this regard, Glific has made significant strides in both monthly subscription revenue and consulting revenues. Glific is at a 25% sustainability rate today, and our goal is to cross 30% by the end of the year. A summary view of our statistics dashboard is
available here.
Glific fell significantly short in its sales goals for Q3. Our biggest issue is with Facebook verification and we have 4 NGOs in the pipeline awaiting this. We have connected with the FB and Gupshup teams and hope to make this process smoother and easier going forward.
Tech4Dev gave 2 talks with NGOs across India in online events. Lobo was part of a panel for
Supercharging Philanthropy through technology
and along with the Svarya team conducted a one day online course for 75+ NGO leader for the
Resilience Strategies for NonProfits
Course
We continue our monthly series of technology articles with the folks at
India Development Review
. You can read the articles currently

. Our latest article by Riah Forbes focussed on
approaches to funding technology in the social sector.
Plio Case Study – Avanti Fellows (AF)
AFs goal is to provide children from low income backgrounds access to quality higher education via supplementary learning programs with additional teaching at a student level. In 2020, millions of students were forced to study online during the COVID-19 lockdown. AF was running an at-home learning program for the students of public schools in Haryana. They were teaching Math and Science using a combination of YouTube Videos and Google Forms for assessments and quizzes. But student engagement was a big problem with even the best videos seeing a sharp drop off after 1 minute. Additionally, YouTube only provides aggregate statistics with no way to gather data at an individual viewer level.
To tackle this, the team developed Plio – an open source tool that allows any educator to convert a YouTube video into interactive lessons and gather rich data on user engagement. Soon, the YouTube & Google Form links being sent to students on WhatsApp was switched to Plio links. Students started watching plios and learning in an interactive manner. More than 40,000 students interacted with Plio with a 5x higher retention rate compared to YouTube. In May ’21, the team launched the productized version of the tool and opened it up for educators at large. Currently, Plio has more than 6000+ registered users with 2 other NGOs outside of AF actively using it.
In August21 with schools reopening, AF launched their Blended Learning Program across public schools in Haryana to enable effective at-home learning for students. As a part of the program, the team developed a few additional tools to enable a seamless interactive video (called plios) consumption experience for students while also keeping in mind the role of teachers in the process.
Teacher Interface for Lesson Plans: A simple web app that uses Google Sheets as backend to host the Avanti Plio library with an option to send Plio links directly on Whatsapp. This is used by teachers to send Plios as revisional homework to students.
Authentication Layer: Given the programs target segment, a major roadblock is authentication.These students usually do not have email IDs and have multiple users using a single device. This makes the popular Google or Phone/OTP based authentication methods unfeasible. To tackle this, the team developed a modular authentication layer that can be used for identifying and validating users across different user points of contacts. Currently, all Plio links being sent to students are wrapped with the auth layer. On clicking the link, students are asked to enter their SRN number (unique student ID) and are redirected to the Plio player once validated. But, the auth-layer is designed in a way that can enable redirection of users to any platform like G-meet, Zoom etc.
While the above tools helped with effective plio consumption by students, it was also imperative as a part of the program to arm teachers with student learning reports that helped close the feedback loop. For this, the team used Glific to create an automated flow which enabled sending of auto-generated, customized, teacher-specific messages with metrics gathered from the Plio platform (no. of viewers, average accuracy, average watchtime etc.) to teachers across Haryana.

Summary
Q4 2021
– for the first time in these reports, words fail me. In general, I am always optimistic and upbeat, but the resurgence with the omicron strain has managed to dampen even my positivity. But my belief in humanity remains strong, and we will get through this: together, stronger and more empathic. I hope you had a restful and relaxing holiday and a good new year with friends and family. We had a fun time waiting for the roads to Tahoe to open, so we could go enjoy the ample snow. The wait was worth it, Tahoe was beautiful with so much snow, and we got a good workout with shoveling and cross country skiing.
Glific
continues to be our main focal point over the past quarter. We got back on track and onboarded 6 NGOs this quarter with a good pipeline in place for Q1 2022. We also overshot our consulting revenue targets working with some stellar NGOs including Avanti Fellows, STiR Education and Digital Green. From a revenue and sustainability perspective, Glific is exceeding its 25% sustainability target, and we will close 2021 at 30% sustainability. We continue to have regular webinars with our software partners to attract new customers.
We made the hard decision to shut down
FundImpact
(FI), our platform that helps social organizations track project funds, deliverables, and impact on the ground. We will merge FundImpact with Dhwanis Grant Management System (mGrant). In retrospect, our primary mistake was failing to ensure that there was a market need for FundImpact especially since it intersects with both accounting systems and grant management systems.
We welcome
FossUnited
– a non-profit foundation that aims at promoting and strengthening the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystem in India to our funders collaborative. FossUnited is supporting both Avni and Glific to add features to our open source platforms. It is really awesome to have a funder who is aligned with our vision and helps us build the open source ecosystem across India.
The Tech4Dev sprint held In Tehri in mid-Nov was definitely the highlight of the year for us. A group of 35 people across 13 organizations from 4 countries involved in the social sector space gathered for a week of co-working, discussions, food and hikes. It was the first in-person gathering for many of us during a lull in the pandemic, and it was worth the travel and the testing. You can read the final report and highlights on the
sprint here
. We hope ???? to be able to hold two similar events in 2022, as we see this as the core aspect of building the tech ecosystem.
In 2022, we expect to grow our partner ecosystem. We are having conversations with the folks at
GramVaani
,
Aam Digital
,
IDEMS International
and
EdZola
for future projects. We are also working with
Hyperverge Academy
and
Colored Cow
on a pilot program to improve the gender balance of technical staff with our partner companies. The program will involve mentoring 12-16 young women from a local engineering college during their studies. In addition to mentoring them and exposing them to life in the real world�(something that most Indian engineering schools do not prepare you for), we will get them internships at software companies and involve them in programs like Google Summer of Code.
We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet primarily due to our sole focus on Glific. We expect our expenses to increase significantly in 2022 as we expand into other programs and increase the sales, consulting and NGO support staff at Glific.
Highlights and Misses
2021 saw Avnis usage and revenue from projects go up significantly. NGOs used Avni for a wide range of Covid-related activities: managing drug stocks offline, tracking infections, vaccinations and relief efforts. Many Avni customers, even in non-Covid applications, increased their Avni usage in 2021. Avni also signed a few new customers in 2021. With these new and existing customer projects, Avni has made significant progress towards being self-sustaining: in 2021, project revenues were able to pay for 76% of Avni expenses. Avnis year-end report is available
here
Glific continued to enable more conversations and get new customers in 2021. In 2021, Glifics 31 NGO partners interacted with over 80K+ contacts and exchanged over 4M+ messages. Glific is now used by NGOs in nine states and supports 13 indian languages including Indian Sign Language.  Glific consulting picked up in 2021 with NGOs tapping the team for solution design and additional functionality, Glific revenues for 2021 were ?28L with about 40% coming from consulting. Glifics year end report is available
here
.
Closing down FundImpact was our biggest miss. We should have done a better job doing research and needs analysis before kicking off the project. This failure ensures that we build a strong group of NGOs who are vested in the project (both human resources and financially) as an advisory group during the initial planning stages.
Avni and Glific also received a grant from Zerodha and FOSS United that supports our work in building open source platforms for the social sector.
Tech4Dev & Glific – Looking back and forward
Tech4Dev will be 3 years old in April, 22, with two of them being under the pandemic. Weve learned a lot in the past 3 years and are working on our plans for the next couple of years. Here are some of our biggest learnings and things we want to focus on going forward
Spending the first year and half interacting and learning from 30+ NGOs was a valuable and worthwhile exercise. We got a better idea of some of the problems and challenges they face, got experience working with our NGO partners and figured out things that help form a strong partnership.
We were quite sure that building a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform was the way forward for most NGOs. The pandemic validated this as seen by the success of  our SaaS platforms like Glific, Avni, mForm and mGrant.
Technology is an enabler, and allows NGOs to do things better, faster, more flexibility etc. However our experience has been that in addition to the tech, NGOs need help with how best to adapt and match their program to the strengths of the platform. This has really come up with the past quarter as more and more NGOs onboard with Glific.
Glific today is a solid and extensible platform. In 2022, we see lots of opportunities to work closely with NGOs to make effective use of tech & digital communications. In the coming year, we plan to add a relationship manager to work closely with NGOs on Glific consulting projects. We also plan to add a Sales/Business Development resource to get the deals going. A summary view of our statistics dashboard is
available here.

Summary & Highlights
Q1 2022
– The world continues its roller coaster ride with the pandemic, and it seems like the pandemic is slowing down as we swing back to normalcy at a fast and furious rate. It feels good to resume in-person meetings with our funders, software partners, and NGO friends. Overall, we are quite positive about the future and looking forward to expanding our interaction with our partners significantly in 2022
Tech4Dev
hired our first country head for India
Erica Arya
. Erica comes with a great combination of working both at technology companies and in NGOs leading the path in digital communications (
Digital Green
and
BBC Media Action
). We look forward to seeing Erica take Tech4Dev 2.0 to new heights and help us build a stronger ecosystem. You can read more about Erica in her
introductory blog post here
. To help us in our work with our NGO partners weve also recruited
Ranjana Gosavi
. Ranjana will be leading our business development efforts with our NGO partners initially for Glific and later on for other Tech4Dev platforms.
We welcome
The Agency Fund
– a non-profit foundation that invests in ideas & organizations
that support the navigation of difficult lives and
Cisco
– a technology company based in Silicon Valley into the Tech4Dev funders collaborative. It is super encouraging to see more funders who are willing to bet on the ecosystem and partner with us in our vision of building open, shared, and transparent platforms. The Agency Fund grant is for Glific to build new features to extend the platform to better serve the needs of our partner NGOs. The Cisco grant is for Glific to Productize Educational Interactions via WhatsApp. We will be working with a cohort of 8 education based NGOs over the next one year to extend and strengthen their use of Glific.
Glific
continues to make solid progress on both customer acquisition and consulting contracts. We onboarded another 8 NGOs this quarter and picked up a large consulting contract to help develop and maintain a chatbot with a large number of potential users. We are still working with NGOs to enable at least a few of them to explode in terms of both messages and contacts, and we hope to hit that benchmark sometime this year. The team met in person in February at my moms place in Mumbai. We invited a few NGOs to co-work with us. More details and feedback from our
NGOs on the event are here
. Our next sprint will be in
ColoredCows
Delhi office the week of April 11th.
Women-in-Tech – A pilot with HyperVerge Academy
This quarter saw us kickstarting the Women in Tech pilot with HyperVerge Academy and Colored Cow to upskill young women in the field of software development, empowering them to seek well-paying internships and jobs as developers, in turn improving the gender diversity ecosystem in the tech space, particularly in tech for non-profits.
We onboarded 21 young women pursuing their degrees from THDC-IHET, Tehri ranging from 1st year to 4th year students.
The young women were split into 4 batches and are being mentored in technical skills by software engineers from Colored Cow. They are also being mentored in soft skills by volunteer mentors sourced by HV Academy.
We are currently at the 2 month mark, and have managed to retain 20 of the 21 young women in continuing the program and delivering consistent weekly outcomes.
In 2 months, each of the learners have picked up the basics of programming and have gotten their hands dirty by building a simple web application of rock, paper, scissors using HTML, CSS and JS. They are now in the process of building a social media application by themselves using MERN stack.
Here
is a collection of all the weekly blog posts penned by our learners reflecting on their journey at WIT across 2 months.
You can read more about the teams experience of piloting this program

Tech4Dev 2.0
Tech4Dev 1.0 completes its three year funding cycle with this report. Weve been hard at work conceptualizing what wed like our next three year plan to look like based on the learnings from the first version. Our main focus will be to strengthen the nonprofit tech ecosystem in India. The important aspects of Tech4Dev 2.0 include:
Continue our work from the first cycle, specifically strengthening our platforms, expanding support for Glific, Avni and supporting/adopting three new open source platforms in the next three years.
Pilot a Women-in-Tech program where we will create opportunities, help upskill, and spread awareness for young women engineers and designers to create large-scale social impact through their work.
Pilot a Fractional CTO Program where we deploy an experienced technologist to help NGOs actively monitor, evaluate, iterate, and integrate technology into their overall programs We will do this by assigning dedicated fractional CTOs to our selected cohort of NGO partners.
Raise USD 7.5 million, with Chintu Gudiya Foundation at USD 2 million and 4 marquee funders at USD 1 million each. We also anticipate revenues of up to USD 1.5 million during this period.

==================================================

Summary
Q2 2019 was focused on operations: Getting a few projects off the ground, Completing a couple of smaller projects and Making significant progress on the remainder. We tightened our operational processes of assigning evaluators to projects and doing a formal review of projects before design and implementation. We expanded our software partners group by adding two new partners to the collaborative.
Highlights
Completed 3 projects, will complete most of the first cohort projects by the end of Q3, 2019
Added two new software partners:
Tech4Good
and
AnnieCannons
. Tech4Good is helping NGOs down the technology road in the early stages. AnnieCannons complements our work in the survivor space very nicely.
We
released the application
for the second cohort. We will choose the second cohort by the end of Q3
We streamlined our bi-monthly meetings. At each meeting, we have one main presentation, which is a deep dive into an existing project. This expands the knowledge base of the group and gets folks to think about reuse and commonality with existing projects.
We instituted project review meetings with the software partners for all new projects. This allows us to get a better idea of the problem that is being addressed and how realistic the proposed solution is. We also plan to do check-in calls with NGOs after the project review for their project is completed.
The
first version of the contract
between Dasra and the partners for financial payments has been completed. We have started work on the second version to make it more open source friendly
Lumen consulting has been hard at work on a fundraising slide deck to showcase our work to investors in India during the first week of August.
Our next face to face meeting has been scheduled for November 10 – 12.
We are starting to do pro-bono consult with larger orgs: STiR education, Indus Action, Educate Girls with regard to some of their technology problems. This might be an area that we could get into in future years.
OpenCHS
and
Primero
are both gaining traction internally as open source solutions to base our work on.
We have started conversations with like minded organizations doing similar work, specifically
Team4Tech
and
MightyAlly
We have started surveying our NGO partners and our software partners approximately twice a quarter using
Funder Feedback
. We?ll have a detailed analysis of the feedback recd in the next report.
Misses
We need to improve our internal processes and the tools we use to manage them. In the ideal scenario, we should be able to tell the status of all the projects from a dashboard.
Our social media presence, especially on LinkedIn is lacking. We need to rectify this before the end of the year. This should help us gain visibility for both the project as a whole, but also allow us to highlight some of the work we are doing.
Our software partner recruiting process has slowed down. We still need to recruit two to four software partners before the end of the year.

Tech4Dev Mission
Building a Collaborative of Software Companies and Funders to develop Open-Source Solutions for the Social Sector.
Summary
Q4 2019
saw us wrapping up most of the projects from the first cohort. We also finalized the NGOs for the second cohort and the NGOs for the
chat for impact
cohort (our third cohort) in partnership with
turn.io
. We had another great partner meeting in Pune and represented Tech4Dev at multiple events in India and North America.
We signed our partnership with
Persistent Systems
and have a team of 5 people (developers, UI/UX) from Persistent hard at work on the
Avni Project
. We wrapped up the legal documentation between NGOs, Partners and Project Tech4Dev. We welcome four new funders who have committed to supporting Tech4Dev for the next three years.
Case Study of Bridges of Sports Project
Bridges of Sports (BoS) works with athletically gifted tribal communities in Karnataka. They work with local coaches to identify potential Olympic athletes and train them to their full potential. The coaches involved with BoS conduct training sessions at schools and local playgrounds in the villages. BoS also conduct leagues: events where athletes and coaches from multiple villages gather and conduct races. This helps to identify exceptional athletes and to build sportsmanship. They currently gather data using a combination of paper-based methods and spreadsheets. Their current procedures would benefit from having an easy-to-use digital solution to track athletes’ training and progress.
Maverick Labs, a Tech4Dev software partner, is working with Bridges of Sports to build a comprehensive athlete management system. The solution enables coaches to access and run customized diet and exercise programs for each athlete under their guidance. Coaches can also collect data for every training session in an exercise plan, and monitor the progress of the athletes that they are training. The solution includes an Android app for use by the coaches, and an admin panel to monitor the collected data. The android app has offline functionality, with data being synced when internet access is available. The admin panel is used to create customized diet and exercise plans for athletes, and view the progress of all athletes in the system.

Ongoing Support
for NGOs
Toward the goal of building strong and transparent relationships between NGOs and software partners, in Q4 2019 we focussed on better processes and communication with NGOs and our partners. We are incorporating those learnings into streamlining systems and processes for the second cohort. This includes more formal review processes at multiple stages during the project lifecycle.
Overall, we are wrapping up many of the projects from the first cohort, and are starting projects with the second cohort.

New Funders Update
We welcome Suhrud and Chhaya Dagli, Ed and Vanitha Rodrigues, Mike Heffernan and Jo Whitehouse and Biren and Swapna Fondekar who joined the Tech4Dev Funder Collaborative and will be supporting the project for the next three years.

Second Cohort
NGOs
The second cohort application process is over. We have a good group of 10 NGOs, 2 Pilot Projects with mid-sized NGOs and 3 Research Initiatives in this cohort. We are building on the success of the first cohort and hence the larger number since we could take more NGOs in public health, support services for women/children and people management platforms, having already built solutions and gained experience in these areas during cohort 1.

Process Changes
for Cohort 2
Looking back at Cohort 1, we stumbled a bit in Project Management, and hence are making a concerted effort to make significant improvements in this area. The main lesson that we take from Cohort 1 is that, at a higher level, the Tech4Dev team needs to be more involved with all projects and have a better handle on their status to shepherd the relationship between NGOs and software partners. Over time, as NGOs and software partners gain more experience, we aim to reduce this requirement.
One Point of Contact (PoC) from the Tech4Dev side for each Project. Each NGO and Partner will have two PoC?s on their side to ensure smooth and continuous communication.
Get an understanding of the scope and size of the engagement with the NGO in the first month, i.e. the Project Scope Phase.
Get a detailed timeline and estimate for the project. Partners will be focussed on delivering to this timeline and estimate with monthly checkpoints with their Tech4Dev point person, i.e. the Project Plan Phase. Consider reusability and platform/tools standardization in this phase.
Monthly checkpoints and demos with the NGO and Tech4Dev PoC to ensure projects are in line with their estimate and timeline. Weekly checkpoints between the NGO and the Software Partner.
Documentation and reporting weekly using our tracking system on AirTable.

Nov Partner Meeting
We held our second partner meeting in Pune in Nov. All partners attended this meeting and we had a turnout of more than 20 people.
We held a code sprint the day before the main meetings which was the highlight of the meet for most participants. We focussed on two projects: AVNI and the CRM Project. This will be a standard feature for our next couple of meetings.
Another highlight was the talk by NGO Leaders: Raj Gilda from Lend a Hand India and Pradyna Godbole from DeAsra Foundation spoke to the group about their views on technology and the social sector. It is great to hear the perspective from the NGO leaders, since many times it is so different from the way we as technologists think and act and hopefully moves us closer to their reality.
What was also useful were the discussions between the software partners on how to work with NGO clients, and how this experience was similar in some ways to small or medium-sized businesses rather than large corporations. Since we have software firms with a variety of experiences and information about working in the social sector, they were able to share best practices, e.g., the importance of meeting the NGO client face to face before deciding on a scope of work.
With an eye to the future, we also hosted a technical marketing expert, Anuja Apte, who spoke with the software companies about creating interest amongst NGOs in adopting open-source solutions; that merely building great solutions was only the first step toward making them used widely. As a few of the software partners begin productizing and marketing solutions during the coming year, this will be important to keep in mind (See ?Open Source Platforms? below).

Collaborations
and Meetings
Persistent Software Systems
, a global software company has contributed a team of 5 people to work on the
Avni Field Work and Data Collection Project
for 6 months. Our goal is to deepen and extend our relationship with Persistent across multiple projects.
In the second cohort, we have two pilot projects with mid-sized NGO?s:
Medha
and
Give India
. We anticipate these engagements will be structured differently and have a longer life cycle than our engagement with smaller NGOs. We also expect to use such engagements to bring in earned revenue
In a rapid turn of events, we entered into a partnership with
Turn.io
– through our friends at
Mulago Foundation
. Our third cohort will be focussed on NGOs engaged in two way communication with their users primarily via WhatsApp. We have finalized this cohort of 11 NGOs and will start work by mid-January. This is also the first cohort, where we are charging NGOs a third of the total expenses, another source of earned revenue.

Open Source
Platforms
Avni (formerly known as OpenCHS), Primero, and Kobo ToolBox
are all gaining traction internally as open-source solutions to base our work on in the second cohort. We have also started development on a ?CRM? product base that is mobile and web-friendly, which can be used as a basis to build more specific solutions for NGOs. We have a group of 3 NGOs in the second cohort that we are targeting with this solution.
|
Ecosystem Engagement
We represented Tech4Dev in multiple events in Q4:
EDGE – Edelgive Foundation
– Mumbai,
AVPN – India Summit
,
Dasra Philanthropy Forum
– Palo Alto,
UC Berkeley Blueprint Club
, and
BMW
Responsible Leaders Forum
.
Misses and Improvements
Looking back to 2019, we did not track projects in as much depth and rigor as we should have. This is our primary focus for the second cohort of NGOs.
Communication with NGOs can be more effective and efficient. We are struggling with this a fair bit and do realize that we need to document our meetings and ensure we get sign-off from both the partner and the NGO.
A number of projects from the first cohort have dragged on for longer than expected and exceeded their budget. Detailed Project Plans and budget estimates are expected to minimize this.
We need to be better at more explicitly linking the technology solution to improvements in the work done by NGOs, and make this an integral part of how the NGO and the software partners monitor the success of the project.

Reflections on 2019
As we look back at our one year mark, we are proud of what we have accomplished so far, yet aware of the amount of work we still need to do.
We are grateful to the strong support of our funder network who have trusted us to do the right thing. At the same time, many of our funders have asked us hard questions, which have made us think more deeply about what we are doing along with the why and the how.
It has been a delightful surprise to have found such a strong set of partners in the first year. Our wish is that we continue to find more of them across India this year also, which is what is needed to accomplish our goals. We love the discussions and the difference in thoughts and opinions in our face to face meetings, the amount we can learn from each other and the support we can offer each other.
From an NGO perspective, it has been a humbling journey. We are always amazed by how many great organizations that are there out there, and would love to see us get to a stage where we can help many more of them. We are also aware that while we do expect NGOs to adjust to our style, we need to also adjust and be in tune with their style. We will be learning and growing in this regard immensely over the next few years.
More than ever, especially after the
BMW Responsible Leaders Forum
, we do believe that looking at the problem via the lens of networks, collaboration, transparency, and open-source is the right model at this time. We?ve got a great group of partners and funders, and we now need to grow the network and execute.

Tech4Dev
Mission
Building the Open-Source Technology Ecosystem for the Social Sector
Summary
Q1 2020
was the most interesting quarter in our lifetimes. COVID-19 came out of nowhere and is hitting the world hard and fast. All of us are still trying to understand and figure out the medium-term impact, while we are sheltered at home. On the positive side, as a global tech collaborative, we are used to working remotely, and so far things are going smoothly. We have reached out to our NGO and Software Partners with offers of help and assistance. I suspect we will get a few takers for this in the April-May timeframe.
We completed the 12 projects from the first cohort in March. We have detailed project plans and cost documents for the 15 second cohort projects and the 12 chat for impact projects is off and running after a good training session in Mumbai in February. We welcomed four new partners and one new funder to our ecosystem putting us at 90% of our fundraising target with 14 funders. We represented Tech4Dev at events in Brussels, Bengaluru, and Mumbai. AnnieCannons, a Tech4Dev NGO Partner won a major grant from Novo Foundation and our chat for impact partner, Turn.io is powering the technology behind the WHO WhatsApp chatbot.
Case Study of Avni Platform
– Dam Desilting Platform
Sedimentation is a problem faced by dams and water catchments, whereby the flowing sediments settle to the bottom of the dam because of the stoppage of water flow. This impacts the dams negatively. On the other hand, the silt present in these sediments is quite fertile and suited for agriculture. This presents an opportunity for creating a win-win situation if it can be taken out and given to farmers. The government of the state of Maharashtra initiated a desilting project in partnership with the local NGOs. The NGOs were tasked with monitoring the work in addition to farmers being mandated to collect the silt extracted.
Given the large distributed scale of the activity, monitoring of this work was difficult without technology. A field-based data collection and a monitoring system was conceptualized using Avni. All the key details of the project work were recorded from the field, allowing for tracking of progress and expediting them. This project is being scaled now to a few other states in India. Avni allowed the organization to collect data from more than 29,000 farmers across 6,400 villages in realtime.
Avni has been used in 20 NGOs predominantly in the field of community health (maternal, child, adolescent, sickle cell). But, it is a generic open-source platform designed for all kinds of fieldwork. Dam desilting is an example of one such project supported by Tech4Dev. A customizable, open-source platform reduces cost, risk, and time-to-field for NGOs who use them.

Ongoing Support
for NGOs
We initiated more formal review processes at multiple stages during the project lifecycle for the second cohort. Projects first submit a
project scope
document outlining the work that they will (and won?t) do as part of the project. This is followed by a
project plan
document that goes into milestones, timeline and cost estimates for the project. These documents are done with the NGO which makes the process transparent and improves communication.

New Funders
We welcome the Raghuram Family Fund who joined the Tech4Dev Funder Collaborative and will be supporting the project for the next three years. We are currently at 90% of our target of USD 3 million for the three years ending in 2021.
From the third cohort onwards, we have started charging NGOs a percentage of the total cost of the project. We expect this fee to be approximately 25% of the total project cost. In addition to reducing our expenses, we expect to get the NGOs to be more responsive and vested in the project due to their financial commitment. This was validated in the response and some of the questions we got about the fee structure and our services by the third cohort NGOs.
|
New Partners
We added two software partners in India –
Colored Cow
and
DataOGram
. We expect to start working on projects with them in Q2 2020. We also conducted our training session in Mumbai on Chat for Impact with our partner
Turn.io
. Finally, we are partnering with
HZontal
on adding features to
Tella
– a documentation app for android specifically designed to protect users in repressive environments. We will be deploying Tella with human rights organizations in India, starting with
Empower People
, a second cohort NGO.

Partner
Highlights
AnnieCannons
, one of our first research project grantees towards an open-source
survivor-centric continuum of care system
has received
$916,000
in funding over three years as one recipient of
The Life Story Grants
, a $10 million,
three-year initiative funded by the NoVo Foundation
to close the on-ramps into the sex trade and open pathways to exit. We are super proud and excited for AnnieCannons and at the same time, this reinforces our commitment to investing in people and systems that have the potential to create a significant impact.
Samanvay
and
Web Access
are working with the state authorities to deploy the second version of the Dam Desilting Project (first cohort NGO). The work builds on last year?s project and will be supported by local foundations. This work will contribute functionality to the Avni Project.
DataOGram
has offered its SaaS Platform (Kobo + Metabase) free to NGOs and Govt bodies that are resource-starved or working to support the COVID-19 response. They are directly engaged with a group of NGOs and are also working with another large NGO to track the procurement and delivery of supplies across the country.
In the past few months, we?ve come across two other organizations:
Catalyst
in the UK and
Tech Matters
in the US/Bay Area with goals and approaches similar to ours. It’s a good sign for the ecosystem when multiple entities arise to serve similar needs in different regions. We will work on partnering with them and learning from each other’s successes and failures.
|
Chat for Impact
Cohort Update
In mid-February, we gathered a group of 12 NGOs, 3 Software Partners and our chat for impact partner –
Turn.io
at
Edelgive?s
offices in Mumbai for an
intense three-day training and implementation
workshop. The training went great, it was a good combination of theory (the rules and regulations of the WhatsApp Business API Platform) and hands-on practice with NGOs implementing their use cases on the platform. More importantly, it was really awesome to see the folks from different organizations share ideas, network and learn from each other over the three days. We do think building this ecosystem and bringing folks together to discuss, plan, and work on issues that affect all of them is the key aspect of what we want to do. We followed the training with a meetup that was open to all NGOs to learn more about the power of two-way communication and what they can do to get ready and integrate this as a component of their outreach to their communities.
We plan on either partnering with Turn.io or starting a new project to build an open-source platform to facilitate two-way communication. The ecosystem is lacking a solution and the need for something like this is pressing. We will make significant progress on this in Q2/Q3 2020.
|
Collaborations
and Meetings
We attended the
Sustain OSS and Fosdem in Brussels
,
Change the Script in Bengaluru
and the
Dasra Philanthropy Week in Mumbai
. The main takeaway from these conferences is the rising power of networks and collaboratives. Today, there is a lot more funding towards open-source software (OSS) than in the years past and some of the larger foundations (Ford, Sloan, OSF) are now actively funding open-source infrastructure projects. Weirdly though, the number of NGO focussed OSS projects at these conferences is close to zero and overall is an incredibly tiny part of the larger OSS ecosystem. We need to fix this and are trying to figure out how, why, etc.
Another important aspect of being part of events in addition to the exposure is learning about new partners, interesting projects and potential new funders. Two of our recent partners came from events we attended in the past couple of months. The exposure we get at these conferences is also totally worth the time invested at these conferences.

Reflections from Persistent
– our Industry Partner on Avni
This section was contributed by Priya Singh, Heramb Abhyankar and Tarun Joshi from Persistent.
Our team is gaining good experience in open-source development & contribution through this project. They learned pair programming, resulting in excellent team bonding & harmony.
Teams resolve problems faster when they work in pairs. Most of the UI development team is being reskilled from Angular to React. This is an excellent platform to gain hands-on experience with the new technology.
The product is complex and team members are taking extra time to understand the workflows and concepts. Dedicated bandwidth from Samanvay has proven a big help to the team.
The product backlog needs to be captured well in terms of user stories and estimation. Avni has a long way to go in terms of documentation.
Looking back we feel that the product training by the Avni team could be planned better and it should have covered significant application complexities/POCs.
During application development, the team is required to do a lot of analysis like POCs, exploring existing code to understand details i.e. logs, workflows, etc. which impacts the final estimate adversely. Approaches/Strategies should be finalized as early as possible to avoid rework later.
Overall this was a good experience for the Persistent team. This was the first time that Tech4Dev and Avni worked with an industry partner. We see this as a learning experience and have been working closely with Persistent to continuously improve on the pain points/issues raised by their team.
Misses, Reflections and
Improvements
While our selection process improved significantly in the second cohort, we can do even better and minimize the mistakes we made in the second cohort. In specific, we need to ensure that organizations are of a certain size and budget and can integrate tech tools and support them outside our intervention. We also need to ensure organizations have good processes and validate them during the interview process.
We need to continue working with partners and documenting our processes better. This will enable our partners to understand what we mean by scope and plan, and to spend the required number of hours on each of them, yet giving us enough information to tweak the scope. In cohort 2, many partners merged their scope and plan in the first phase. Some of the plans and costing were a bit too ambitious, and we could have tweaked it during the scoping phase. This will also help with onboarding new partners.
This planning highlights any potential issues later, which might lead us to take a closer look at the project. This has resulted in us canceling one project (Vidhayak Bharti) and reducing the scope of another (Empower People). It also allows us to connect the dots at a higher level and find common threads between various projects and/or the broader open-source ecosystem.
We continue to pursue the policy of reuse vs build and funded feature development for

COVID-19
– Response, Reflections, and Implications
We canceled our in-person meeting in Goa in mid-April. We also had to cancel a gathering of some of the tech4dev grantees and potential funders in late March in the Bay Area. We hope to reschedule these events when the world is at a more stable point.
All of our community-based NGOs have pulled out of fieldwork due to the lockdown. We expect this will have an impact on the implementation of some of our projects. We do think that some of our NGO partners will have more important issues to deal with than our project. Our goal is to listen and follow their lead and work with them if possible, but support them in all the ways we possibly can.
We do anticipate that for most of our NGO Partners, recovery after COVID will be a long and hard path. We do think that most of them will appreciate and try to incorporate more tech in the medium-long term to facilitate remote working, but in the short term, there is a strong possibility that our technology interventions might not be an important part of their plans. We are going back and revisiting our second cohort projects with a post-COVID lens to take this into account and to make better use of our resources to develop open-source generic platforms.
We have also been engaging with NGOs and cautioning them against the hasty adoption of technology as a response to COVID-19. The hardest part of technology adoption is rarely the technology itself but in preparing teams for the change. Preparation, obtaining buy-in and training are all steps that would still need to be undertaken before the benefits of technology will become apparent.
Remote working is not a big thing in India, so we do expect a fair bit of slowdown from our software partners over the next few weeks also. We expect this to get better over time. We anticipate that there will be changes to business inflow with some of our partners.
Dries Buytaert of Drupal, has an interesting post on
Is Open-Source recession-proof?
This is a good opportunity for us to double down on our existing open-source investments and start a couple of new open-source projects as we get more talent into the space.
We took advantage of the slow times to reflect and write down our
Tech4Dev 2020 – Vision and Milestones document
using a template borrowed from our friends at
Mulago Foundation
.
If you are interested in specific details and our thought process, please do read our
Tech4Dev COVID-19 Plan document
. It is a work in progress and a living document, and hence subject to change at a significant rate. But this should give you an insight into what we are thinking and the hows and whys behind it.

Summary
Q2 2020
was a very different quarter for everyone. We are getting used to the current normal, and speculating what and when the new normal will be. Most of our Indian NGOs either switched to COVID-19 relief and/or shut down their field operations. This resulted in the slowing of project implementation across most projects. We also decided to postpone the fourth cohort of NGOs to a future time when things hopefully will get better.
The slowdown gave us the opportunity to take a step back and focus on our open-source platforms which we believe will help us scale the program and deploy it across multiple NGOs in a more effective, and cost-efficient manner. We brought forward work that we had initially thought would happen in late-2020 and early-2021. As such, Q2 2020 was super productive for us in this regard and we made solid progress on multiple projects.
This report is different from previous reports. We will focus on our open-source projects, our learning, and some changes going forward.
Glific – An Open Source Two Way Communication Platform
In early July, we released v0.1 of Glific. Glific is our two-way communication platform built specifically for the social sector. We learned a lot from our experience with the third cohort with
turn.io
and realized that this was a pressing need. There currently is no affordable solution for NGOs in the developing world, and Glific will address that need. You can read the
full blog post on our website.
You can watch a
video of the demo here
. We plan on monthly releases to showcase our progress and onboard adventurous NGOs in the next two months.
Medha – Linking Government, Employers and Students
In Q1 2020, we entered into a partnership with
Medha
to develop an open-source job training, placement, and tracking system for use by Medha, the UP Government, college students,  polytechnic college staff, and local employers. This was our first interaction with an organization delivering systems to be used by the Government. Medha also contributed financially to the system and will take ownership of the project going forward.
FundImpact – Simplifying Donor Reporting
Dhwani
, one of Tech4Dev’s partners, has begun the development of
FundImpact
, a platform for managing donors, deliverables, and impact reports. We are modeling their development cycles and cadence based on our experience with Glific so far. The FundImpact platform is just getting out of the gate; the FundImpact team gathered the initial set of product requirements through discussions with NGOs over the past few weeks. Just like all of our other projects, the FundImpact platform will have predictable releases and regularly posted blogs about their progress and learnings.
Avni – Field Work and Data Collection Platform
In our last cohort, we had a total of five projects that were based on the Avni platform — all implementations for NGOs to collect healthcare-related data and case-management. All five projects are still active, despite some hiccups due to COVID-19. We expect to complete work on these projects by Sept 2020.
On the platform front, Avni had an exciting quarter. We released a new version of the
Field App and App Designer
and announced the
Avni Cloud
. Avni folks have also been doing webinars about the Avni platform that have been well attended. Our partnership with Persistent Systems on building core functionality for Avni remains strong and healthy.
Other thoughts and musings
We signed out MoU with
Social Alpha
this quarter. We are now officially under their umbrella in India. We hope to leverage their expertise in specific areas this year to strengthen our work and community: i.e. technology platforms, financial reporting, compliance, etc.
Github released a report on
Open Source in the Social Sector
which is an informative read and puts our work in a bigger context. It was gratifying to see
CiviCRM
getting high marks and praise in this report.
We’ve been personally involved with the design and development of Glific. This has given us a better understanding of multiple things including:
Structuring the design and development of future projects
Involving the NGO community at a very early stage for User Research, Validation and just great advice. Both FundImpact and Glific have active NGO Advisory Groups.
Weekly demos, Monthly releases, Monthly advisory meetings and more
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment, documentation, testing and code quality tools from project inception.
Focus on getting paid “customers” early on, and on-boarding them within the first six months. This means development of a SaaS platform to host NGOs at an early stage.

Summary
Q3 2020
was not a lot different than Q2 2020. The impact of the pandemic on small to medium-sized NGOs is huge, and a fair bit of uncertainty into what the road ahead will look like for everyone involved. We continued our focus on open source platforms, specifically FundImpact and Glific, and slowed down our technology projects with NGOs across the board.
We are using this period to ramp up our education efforts across the sector in concert with multiple partners including
Tech4Good Fellows
, and
India Development Review
. We are also building the community around Glific, FundImpact, and Avni with monthly releases and webinars.
We continue to provide pro-bono advisory services to multiple medium-large sized NGOs including STiR Education, Lend-a-Hand India, Educate Girls, Jan Sahas, and Indus Action.
Given the pandemic and our focus, this report is a lot shorter than the previous reports. Well share some highlights from our projects and partners, share links to our product demos, and end with our financials.
Case Study of Saajha
– Use of two-way communication
Saajha was part of the Tech4Dev Third Cohort. They started off using WhatsApp communication to target families in Delhi who were in crisis during COVID-19 and needed food supplies immediately. Being able to automate parts of the communication flow, they were able to target the families in crisis relatively quickly. This was an example of good interaction between technology and human intervention, where a staff person would call and talk to the involved families and ensure they got the necessary supplies.
Saajha is building technology tools to solve problems for parents of students studying in government schools. One such problem is the lack of information related to schools which is usually available with the school authorities or the department of education. COVID-19 has further disconnected parents from the school leading to an information gap. Their vision is to ensure that a parent spends less time getting answers to their questions and has the necessary support whenever required. One of the tools that are critical to the success of their vision is their WhatsApp Bot. In the last few months, they have supported around 3,300 parents and exchanged around 50,000 messages. Recently they organized an hour-long online training session in collaboration with the Delhi govt. for parents; about 10,000 parents and 800 schools attended the session over two days.
Manish @ Saajha advises the Tech4Dev team on Glific.

CivicDataLab wins
2020 Presidential Hackathon
Our partner CivicDataLab has won the 2020 Presidential Hackathon for the Health Procurement Performance Index for Himachal Pradesh – the first-ever Open Contracting Data solution deployed in India. Tech4Dev had funded CivicDataLab to build a fiscal data explorer for Himachal Pradesh. Fiscal Data Explorer is a unique tool where citizens can explore both budgets and spending data of state governments in an easy to comprehend and simple to use manner.

Tech4Good gets
funding from Omidyar Network
Our partner Tech4Good got a Rapid Response Covid19 grant from Omidyar Network India to help bridge the gap between available technology tools and the challenges that nonprofits face in adopting them. This includes a weekly Spotlight webinar on various tools used in the ecosystem.
|
FundImpact releases
v0.2 of its platform
The team at DhwaniRIS is hard at work on a monthly release schedule of the Fund Impact (FI) platform. They just released v0.2 of the platform that helps medium to large-sized NGOs manage donors, deliverables, and impact reports. FI Bridges the gap between Project Monitoring Tools and Accounting tools and helps organizations track the progress of project commitments with the grants received.  A
short video of the product can be seen here.
|
Glific releases
v0.4 of its platform
The Glific team has released v0.4 of its two-way communication platform. They also launched their website at
glific.org
. We had two well-attended webinars in August (95 attendees) and September (40 attendees) and will continue to do so monthly. The main goal of the webinars is to showcase how a couple of pioneering NGOs are using communication to move their programs forward in a super effective manner. The team is currently piloting the product with a few NGOs in India and is actively recruiting new NGOs to the platform. You can watch an
overview video of Glific here.
Our pilot NGOs are in the educational, career awareness, and skilling sectors, using Glific to interact, guide, and engage their students.

Tech4Dev to sponsor
an article series in IDR
Tech4Dev is sponsoring a series of 8-10 articles over the next 8 months in the
India Development Review
(IDR). IDR is a media platform that publishes articles on problems, ideas, and real-world solutions within the development sector in India. The sponsored series will cover the dynamics between technology and non-profits and through the series highlight learnings from our experience working with nonprofits. The series will also include thought-pieces on broader topics such as the functional prerequisites and conditions for non-profits to adopt technology, thinking right about processes, necessary tools, and resources that could be easily accessed by non-profits, and technology adoption by users.

Summary
Q4 2020
was in a similar vein to the previous 2 quarters, a continuation of our pandemic rituals. The US election, the election disputes following that, and the violence at the Capitol was a shock to all of us and the world at large, but it re-emphasizes why it is so important for all of us to be involved and be part of the social and justice movement in whatever way we see fit.
In Q4 2020,
we continued our focus on our open-source platforms. FundImpact (FI) released its first version and began conversations with a few medium-large sized NGOs on using FI. While they do have high-level buy-in from NGO management, it has been a lot slower getting organizations to adopt and start using the platform. Our goal is to get 3 NGOs to be on FI in this quarter.
Glifics
continued onboarding more NGOs onto the platform. Our goal was to get 10 NGOs using the platform by the end of the year, and we managed to meet and exceed that goal. As of mid-Jan, we have
15 NGOs
on the platform. We continue to learn a lot from our user base as we build/extend features that apply to their use-cases. A couple of testimonials from them:
The power of the platform is too powerful! – Gautam from
Reap Benefit
We have been using flows to share activity content with the students and can leverage the power of two-way communication for online self-learning of students. We want to co-develop an open-source platform on Glific to collate the data and implement gamification in our communication – Prashant from
The Apprentice Project
Highlights
Glific got a grant
from
Omidyar Network India
. We also welcome a new funder, Anjali Vishwanath. The Glific team has incorporated grant applications as part of their regular process.
Tech4Good Fellows
in partnership with
Edelgive Foundation
is
launching a special technology cohort
for
womens rights NGOs
Our partners,
Civic Data Lab
,  released a report on the
State of FOSS in India
.
We wrapped up the second Tech4Dev cohort project. We will resume new projects in Q2 2021.
Glific will extend its backend platform to incorporate Signal (if feasible) and Telegram. The latest Glidic platform video can be
seen here
.
Our end-of-year email was well received and by far got the most responses from all of our past communication. Following that pattern, our reports will now consist of a summary and highlights section, a spotlight section, and end with an updated financial statement.
Case Study of Zombie Tracker
– A Project with The Internet Freedom Foundation (India)
Internet Freedom Foundation
(IFF) is an Indian digital liberties organization that works to ensure that citizens can use the Internet with liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. With support from Tech4Dev, IFF is collaborating with
CivicDataLab
, one of the technology partners within the Tech4Dev network, on building a case-law tracker to identify and report cases registered under
Section 66A of the Information Technology Act (IT Act), 2000
(S. 66A). We’re calling it the
Zombie Tracker,
to signify how a dead(struck down) provision is still being invoked.
This provision penalized the sending of offensive messages via online communication but was deemed unconstitutional by the Honble Supreme Court of India in 2015. This was a progressive step that didnt come to fruition as, to date, we see instances of this provision being invoked by the authorities across the country. We intend to use the insights gained from collected data to strengthen our advocacy efforts to ensure that S. 66A dies a complete constitutional death.

Summary
2021
began on a hopeful, upbeat note. Things had been looking up for a while with the general availability of vaccines in India and the US but that has been dampened by the recent waves of Covid-19 infections in many countries including parts of India. This will impact our plans for the second half of the year.
In Q1 2021,
we continued our focus on our open-source platforms.
FundImpact
(FI), our platform that helps Social Orgs track project funds, deliverables and impact on the ground, started
three NGO pilots
in Q1. They continue to do demos and webinars for prospective customers.
Glific
has
continued onboarding more NGOs onto the platform. Our goal was to get 10 new NGOs using the platform by the end of the quarter, and we managed to exceed that goal. As of end-March, we have
20 NGOs
on the platform. We are learning a lot from our user base as we build/ extend features that apply to their use-cases.
We announced our
Fifth Cohort
for NGOs focused on onboarding them to Glific. In this cohort, we will accept 10 NGOs who are using or planning to use WhatsApp and train them on the Glific platform and best practices in digital communication. We plan to announce the NGOs in this cohort by April 30.
Q4 2020
was in a similar vein to the previous 2 quarters, a continuation of our pandemic rituals. The US election, the election disputes following that, and the violence at the Capitol was a shock to all of us and the world at large, but it re-emphasizes why it is so important for all of us to be involved and be part of the social and justice movement in whatever way we see fit.
Highlights
Glific
v1.3 was released in March. We will continue with bi-weekly and/or monthly releases. We also do monthly webinars on Glific as our primary sales and marketing channel. Glific onboarded a new software partner,
Maverick Labs
to help with product development.
Glific was used to conduct a mini-RCT for
Weunlearn
. We also onboarded our first US NGO:
Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project
. Glific will be useful for NGOs in the US working with and for immigrants.
Tech4Devs fifth cohort announced
for Q2, 2021. The goal is to onboard 10 NGOs
FundImpact continues to gain traction as a tracking and reporting tool.
CiviCRM (our first project at the intersection of NGOs, technology and open source), won the FSF award for
Projects of Social Benefit.
We consider Tech4Dev an evolution of what we started at CiviCRM and we hope to make as big an impact with Tech4Dev.
As NGOs continue to hunker down and rely more and more on digital platforms over field personnel, we will continue to look for gaps to fill in helping NGOs with technology and build platforms or contribute to existing open-source platforms to enrich the broader open-source technology offerings for social organizations.
Learnings from our open source platforms
It’s been a bit more than a year since the pandemic, and our decision to devote most of our energy and resources to our open source platforms, Glific and FundImpact. In retrospect, this was the right decision, and well spend some time reflecting on what worked and what did not. So a random, semi-structured walk of our journey in the past year.
Glific was the right project at the right time for the sector. We were well served with our experience with the third cohort, and building on that gave us a solid foundation.
Having a good advisory group of NGOs to give us feedback in the first three months of Glific was super helpful. Onboarding pilot NGOs in month four, and then a regular stream after that, helped focus the product and our offerings.
FundImpact is also a targeted specific solution solving a need for many medium to large NGOs and companies in India. We should have focussed on getting our pilot group of users involved in the design and specification at a much earlier stage than we did.
It did not help FundImpact, that the Indian Govt rolled out a new policy about re-granting half way through the implementation. This eliminated one of FIs major selling points, and required a mini-pivot
Both Glific and FundImpact have not had a focussed sales and marketing effort. We have to rectify this in Q2 and Q3 2021
Glifics model has been a collaboration with 3 of our software partners, FundImpact is driven by one software partner. So far, both models have seemed to work.
Building communities in the social ecosystem is hard, Glifics attempt at having a live communication channel (via
Discord
) has been semi-successful as an effective support channel, and for collaboration within the Glific team. It has been less successful with NGOs sharing and seeking assistance from other NGOs.
We have one prolific community contributor to Glific, in
Madhav Malhotra
who has contributed the Import API and is now spearheading the billing project.

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: October 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-project-tracker-using-airtable/
==================================================

We were looking for a tool that can give us a top-line analysis of all the projects in the pipeline, including past, present and future projects. It should allow us to get a snapshot of the status of all projects at any point in time. This allows us to follow up on projects that are behind schedule or over budget. Note that all documents will be stored on Google Drive.
We evaluated a few project management tools and also ticketing systems. Most of them worked quite well for the individual project but we were not able to get the data that we needed for our purpose. Here is the document that covers our requirements:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMki14I3Zguz98LZatbGadYLX_TiWDVB9KpOouAOiA0/edit?usp=sharing
Someone recommended us
Airtable
. It looked very promising and we were quickly able to get basic data structure in place. We have 3 main entities:
* Projects
* Contacts
* Activity
One slick feature of the Airtable is you can create different views of the same data. For eg. we created a form to collect weekly status for ongoing projects.
Our next challenge was to send the reminders if the weekly status report is not filled. Fortunately, Airtable has excellent API support. We have written a node application for the same. Code is available at
https://github.com/tech4dev-india/project-tracking-with-airtable
. Currently, we have started a pilot with few projects and have started collecting the data.
Overall, Airatable is very impressive and can be used as a prototyping tool before actual project implementation.Title: Tech4Dev Pune Unconference recap

==================================================

Overview and Recap
We just wrapped up the Tech4Dev Open Source UnConference in Pune, India. It was a gathering of 48 people most of them being technical developers working for or in NGOs across many different sectors: Water, Sanitation, Child Protection, Governance, Public Health, Education, Open Data. We also had a few capacity-building organizations and funders in the room.
We approached this event with lots of curiosity and a bit of apprehension. We were not sure of how folks would react to the format or if they would even interact with other people and organizations, We were worried about not having enough content and folks not willing to lead sessions and demos. We were wrong on all of our fears and partway through the first day, we were fairly confident that people are getting a lot from this meeting.
We structured the first day as a mixture of introductions, open source and funding overview, discussion sessions, and brief 15-minute demos. Based on the feedback from the first day, we structured the second day as a mixture of detailed demos, skillshare sessions, and deep dives into a few topics. We entered the conference thinking we would do a few group hackathons but changed the second-day agenda based on the feedback we received from the group.
The event has left me with excitement about the community that gathered and lots of ideas on how we can collaborate and help each other as a part of a larger initiative. I think the main goal of this event (from my perspective) was to bring this set of folks together to talk, discuss, learn and meet each other. From that perspective, I do think we met our objective. I do hope that members of the group reach out and let each other know when they accomplish something cool and useful and seek help when they are stuck or need assistance.
Links to posts from different folks on their views of the event and what they got out of it are below along with links to meeting notes and photos. Going forward, we hope to have another event in a year or before to continue building the community. We hope to expand the group and bring in more folks into the community.

Where can we improve
Discussion slots on the first day should be more focused with a couple of facilitators chosen beforehand. Need to ensure it does not turn into a presentation but can veer in the direction the group is more interested in.
Ensure that we minimize the use of tech jargon and be aware of participants in the group who might not be up to speed on various abbreviations.
WiFi was not available. This potentially limited the demos that people gave. On the other hand, most people were engaged in conversation instead of their devices. This may not necessarily be due to the absence of WiFi but might be a factor
Both days seem pretty packed with little time for networking.
The hackathon did not happen primarily because we felt there was unfinished business from day one. Also seemed like due to the broad interests of the participants, there was limited interest in specific projects. For e.g., most attendees for the health software topics were attended by folks from those organizations and was of limited interest to others. (which was a surprise to me, since I thought they do the most interesting work)
Limited time for demos on Day 1 raised some concerns with people. On the other hand, we got 16 demos in on day 1 and then had 8 detailed demos on day 2. I think of day 1 demos as more of an introduction and day 2 demos where you can go in-depth
What?s next
Keep the discussion going when starting new projects or tackling difficult problems.
Inform and educate people about interesting and cool work that you are doing
Have monthly webinars with one group demos the work they?ve done. E.g. Within Reach and their analysis platform. Tech4Dev and the projects they are doing for their grantees
Schedule the location and month of the next conference and start a conversation on the focus of the conference and the participants.
Increase the community and get more folks on the mailing list.
Reach out to more women and aim for more diversity. We can and should do better.
Feedback from Participants
We had a discussion on our mailing list about the event. A few folks wrote detailed reports which we put on our blog (links above). Here are some of the other impact statement people made
It was, quite literally, an eye opener, and I am so glad to know that there is a growing and thriving tech community that has a specific focus in the development sector. The unconference allowed me to explore open source implementation beyond my domain and I was thrilled to find so many similarities in tech implementation across different domains – I will definitely be knocking on some doors now. And the unconference format allowed me to learn so many things at once. –
Neha Kulkarni @ Grammangal
As most people have already said I loved the conference. The un-conference part of it reminded me of the many BarCamps I have attended thru the ages – and was a really good fit for this event. And on a personal note, a big thank you to Kurund for taking up the ‘Creating FOSS community’ session. It was a session that I really wanted to learn from. I put it up on the board – and was very happy that there was a person with good experience in that area willing to take it up. –
Binny @ Make a Difference
I would like to share some of my takeaways from the conference:
Got to see various perspectives and learn about what tools are people using to solve different problems. There were also some ideas in there which we could potentially use.
There were sessions around data collection and data cleaning using tools which required no coding. These tools would be very useful for our operations team and can reduce some of their manual work.
It was inspiring to meet so many people working in this sector and feels great to be a part of the community. I felt that we are all part of something big and at the same time it made me realize that there is still so much more to do. –

==================================================

Writing this blog post with Kurund Jalmi next to me while flying back to Mumbai after a week spent in nature with friends and community. My original plan was to write this blog post on the way to the sprint, but that did not happen. So Kurund and I will summarize some of the things and people we spoke with over the past week.
Tejas leading the last session on reflections and recapping the event
We do need to acknowledge our amazing group of funders who have been so generous with their support that allows us to build and nurture the ecosystem. We do realize we have been super lucky in this regard and are immensely grateful to the current group and the new funders coming into support us. Speaking of funders, this was our first sprint where we had a potential funder representative spend 3 days with us. It was an interesting experience, since we are showing both the good and the bad of such events. But, I do think it is important for us (and other NGOs) to have funders interact with everyone in the organization and also from the community over an extended period of time. In this case, the funder did understand what we mean in our mission statement of building the ecosystem and working collabaratively with like minded partners and NGOs. The funder also did a really good job of interacting with the group and participating in many conversations over the multiple meals we had together.
After a long time, we had the original team from Tech4Dev 1.0, 2019 – 2022: Arun Kadekodi, Arjav Chakravarty, Kurund Jalmi, Donald Lobo, Arjun Khandelwal attending an event. We gave the Tech4Dev community a history lesson of our origins and our past work. Kurund and I then rewound time even further and spoke about the origins and history of CiviCRM which we founded and were active from 2005-2015. It felt good to see and hear from Arjun on the growth and challenges of Avni, from their early origins to handling the Water Rejuvenation Project with ATE Chandra Foundation and NITI Aayog. The scale and immensity of the project helps show the true power of collaboration and open source.
For the last 3 days, we had two parallel sprints happening. The Glific team ran the Education Cohort Sprint and Vinod kicked off the Development Data Platform at this event. Getting a group of people to collaborate on an idea is always a challenge. This was made a bit harder with intermittent wifi, power outages and some rain. After a rocky start, the team re-grouped and came up with a smaller set of goals that they achieved over the next two days.
Its always cool to hang out with the Glific NGOs and see what they ve been upto and some of their learnings. We got a good set of new ideas and feature requests to work on for the next 3 months. It was also cool to hear from Rishi @ Quest Alliance in their approach to designing and deploying chatbots. The amount of time and effort spent on designing a good user experience is super important, and all of us came out of that with a good idea of some of the things we could do to improve interaction and engagement. Abhideep of Gramvaani showed the group the power of audio coupled with AI/ML. Building an audio-first chatbot is the path many NGOs are starting to follow, and we hope to work on this with Gramvaani going forward.
I also checked with a few folks on the GarudMaachi Sprint experience vs the Dehradun Sprint. Most people felt that the food was better in Dehradun, The weather was a lot better this time around, though it did rain a couple of times. Both locations were quite scenic and nestled in nature, but personally I do miss access to trails and paths that let us explore the surrondings.
Our next sprint is tentatively planned from Dec 11th – Dec 16th in Pondicherry. Plan on joining us there 🙂
And if you want even more, lots of other folks

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4dev-second-cohort-ngos-announced/
==================================================

After a fairly long involved process, we have selected the cohort for Project Tech4Dev’s second round. We modified the application process quite significantly based on our first cohort experience. In specific, we added a lot more human interaction in the final stages and gave NGOs a better sense of what the grant is all about and their expected involvement.
We got a fairly diverse group of NGOs – both geographically and sector-wise. We continue to maintain a focus on public health deployments via
Avni
and have 5 NGOs as part of this cohort. We also continue our focus on Open Data with
CivicDataLab
and have 2 NGOs in this cohort. The other NGOs are across the spectrum from sectors like Skilling, Self Help Groups, Individual Giving, Rights-Based groups.
Without further ado, the 10 NGOs and their websites are:
ASHWINI (Association for Health Welfare in the Nilgiris)
Centre For Equity Studies
Department of Community, Yenepoya University
Empower People
Internet Freedom Foundation
Jan Swasthya Sahyog
Oorvani Foundation
SeSTA
SETCO Foundation
Vidhayak Bharti
In addition, we have made one research grant to
Dhwani RIS
for the development of an open-source
Fund Management System
. We are also working with
Give India
and
Medha
in pilot projects with medium-sized NGOs which are more involved.
Finally, we have entered into a partnership with the wonderful folks at
Persistent Systems
. Persistent is contributing a team of 6 people towards the development and usability of
Avni
which is an open-source field service delivery and data collection platform.
We thank all the NGOs who applied and were part of the process. We tried to be as transparent in the process and give useful feedback whenever possible.Title: Tech4Dev Second Education Sprint: Power of Community and Technology.

This blog is written by Aparna Singh, from
Suno Sunao
Its been a long time since I have written a piece or blog to share my experiences. Being inspired by fellow attendees at the Project Tech4Dev sprint, here I am sharing mine.
Being in the development sector for more than 5 years I have been a huge follower of the work and ecosystem created by Project
Tech4Dev
.
After all, they have been doing the hard part of building a collective ecosystem. Social impact industries can step forward together with the right set of shared learnings and resources to solve the challenges they are facing. Bringing the social enterprises under the same roof to start a conversation around the challenges faced. You know you are in this together!
A not so organized social impact industry with even more scattered technology implementation, Project
Tech4Dev
is creating opportunities to create open source solutions to address these challenges at low cost.
Hence, came both my excitement and nervousness in attending and presenting in their Sprint.
I was at the very tranquil
SalWood resort
in Dehradun representing
Suno Sunao
solo! As team members
Aishwarya Panicker
,
Aishwarya Raman
were traveling and
Mohit Challa
is based out of Japan. I so missed having everyone by my side.
At the same time, I felt totally lucked out by being in time to attend and represent my team and become part of this amazing community.
Suno Sunao – An AI-enabled
Glific
-backed tool to help women who cannot read or write access information. A product that was conceptualized during the pandemic year 2020 as part of
Salzburg Global Seminar
–
Japan India Transformative Technology Network
supported by Nippon Foundation. And, brought to reality in 2022 by team
Glific
and the mentorship received from Donald Lobo and Erica Arya.
A product very close to each one of us in the team for the shared experiences with the women we come across every day. And, felt the need to address and hopefully create a world without an information barrier for them.
Coming back to the excitement! Because it was the first time presenting
Suno Sunao
to a large group of audience. We had recently piloted the product in Delhi to a community of around 50-60 women. Here was a product with findings presented to a defining audience.
Most of whom have bridged scale and reach. And, we’re working remarkably towards bringing changes in the lives of the underserved in India.
And, Nervous as it was the first step into the unknown. Reminder it was about time to get harsh with self when it came to receiving feedback from people whose works I have been personally inspired from.
The presentation of
Suno Sunao
went well at least that’s what I would assume 😛 And, questions were asked and noted for conversation in the times to follow.
Got a lot of perspective from Tejas Mahajan –
Reap Benefit
, Sebastian Leidig-
Aam Digital
, and Abhideep Singh –
Gram Vaani
. Gram Vani has been using voice as a tool to reach out to communities on the ground. And, we saw an opportunity for potential collaboration to work together. Making it happen soon.
With presenting Suno Sunao for the first time outside of Salzburg Global Seminar and endless conversations over life and technology implementation; this sprint will always be special for this very reason.
Thank you Project Tech4Dev !! See you all in December!Title: Tech4Dev Sprint in Udaipur: Reflections from the City of Lakes

==================================================

Author: Jake Hughey
Role: Core Team Member of the Agency Fund
Im a team member of the
Agency Fund
, which invests in ideas and organizations that expand human agency. A core component of our work is to build our grantees capacity to use technology and data to drive improved outcomes for their beneficiaries, so we collaborate closely with Tech4Dev.
With my colleague Rob On, I recently attended my first Tech4Dev Sprint, which took place in the beautiful city of Udaipur. This was the start of my first trip to India. Such an experience cannot be accurately conveyed in writing, but here are a few approximations.
Interactions with T4D
The first evening of the Sprint included a lively discussion of T4Ds principles. The discussions content, as well as its tone, assured me I was in the right place, because so many principles are shared between T4D and the Agency Fund, e.g., collaboration, openness, and learning.
Much of Agency Funds tech- and data-related work with NGOs resembles that of the fractional CxO program. Participating in the FCxO teams discussions was invaluable for learning from their playbook and experiences, and contributing our own. Each FCxO emphasized the importance of listening and of building relationships, and that much of their value is not explicitly related to tech, but instead about helping the NGO focus and clarify its vision and strategy as a prerequisite to developing a tech and data strategy.
Interactions with NGOs
One NGO supported by both Agency Fund and T4D is Indus Action, which works to ensure that vulnerable families have sustainable access to their legislated rights. Rob and I had several illuminating discussions with their FCxO Ankit Saxena and Executive of Operations Umang Kamra, who graciously answered our many questions about their programs and operations. Together, were forging a collaborative strategy for addressing their high-priority challenges.
One evening we had the privilege of visiting a local NGO,
Aajeekiva
, which provides an array of services for migrant workers. Although I only recently started learning Hindi (meri hindi aachi nahi hai), I didnt need to understand the entirety of the conversations to feel their teams zeal and to get a glimpse of what the real work on the ground is like.
Getting to know the people and the place
Just as valuable as the structured, content-driven time was the unstructured time to chat with and get to know other attendees. It was wonderful to hear peoples experiences, interests, and values. Although Id never met anyone besides Lobo in person, everyone was so warm and inclusive that I felt like part of the group.
Fortunately I also had time to explore Udaipur and start to experience India first-hand. I continue to be struck by the vibrancy of street life (humans, cows, dogs, etc.), the natural beauty (especially as seen from the monsoon palace), and of course the delicious and diverse cuisine.
Conclusions
All these in-person interactions were so much richer than anything that happens via a computer screen, so Im deeply grateful to Tech4Dev for inviting me to attend. Moving forward, I feel inspired by the people in this space and the opportunities to do good. I feel informed about the social sector and how to continue taking action. And after all this Sprinting, I feel exhausted, so I think Ill close my laptop for a time and just listen to the sounds of India in the monsoon.Title: Tech4Dev Sprint in Udaipur: Reflections from the City of Lakes

This blog is written by Jake from
Agency Fund
Im a team member of the
Agency Fund
, which invests in ideas and organizations that expand human agency. A core component of our work is to build our grantees capacity to use technology and data to drive improved outcomes for their beneficiaries, so we collaborate closely with Tech4Dev.
With my colleague Rob On, I recently attended my first Tech4Dev Sprint, which took place in the beautiful city of Udaipur. This was the start of my first trip to India. Such an experience cannot be accurately conveyed in writing, but here are a few approximations.
Interactions with T4D
The first evening of the Sprint included a lively discussion of T4Ds principles. The discussions content, as well as its tone, assured me I was in the right place, because so many principles are shared between T4D and the Agency Fund, e.g., collaboration, openness, and learning.
Much of Agency Funds tech- and data-related work with NGOs resembles that of the fractional CxO program. Participating in the FCxO teams discussions was invaluable for learning from their playbook and experiences, and contributing our own. Each FCxO emphasized the importance of listening and of building relationships, and that much of their value is not explicitly related to tech, but instead about helping the NGO focus and clarify its vision and strategy as a prerequisite to developing a tech and data strategy.
Interactions with NGOs
One NGO supported by both Agency Fund and T4D is Indus Action, which works to ensure that vulnerable families have sustainable access to their legislated rights. Rob and I had several illuminating discussions with their FCxO Ankit Saxena and Executive of Operations Umang Kamra, who graciously answered our many questions about their programs and operations. Together, were forging a collaborative strategy for addressing their high-priority challenges.
One evening we had the privilege of visiting a local NGO,
Aajeekiva
, which provides an array of services for migrant workers. Although I only recently started learning Hindi (meri hindi aachi nahi hai), I didnt need to understand the entirety of the conversations to feel their teams zeal and to get a glimpse of what the real work on the ground is like.
Getting to know the people and the place
Just as valuable as the structured, content-driven time was the unstructured time to chat with and get to know other attendees. It was wonderful to hear peoples experiences, interests, and values. Although Id never met anyone besides Lobo in person, everyone was so warm and inclusive that I felt like part of the group.
Fortunately I also had time to explore Udaipur and start to experience India first-hand. I continue to be struck by the vibrancy of street life (humans, cows, dogs, etc.), the natural beauty (especially as seen from the monsoon palace), and of course the delicious and diverse cuisine.
Conclusions
All these in-person interactions were so much richer than anything that happens via a computer screen, so Im deeply grateful to Tech4Dev for inviting me to attend. Moving forward, I feel inspired by the people in this space and the opportunities to do good. I feel informed about the social sector and how to continue taking action. And after all this Sprinting, I feel exhausted, so I think Ill close my laptop for a time and just listen to the sounds of India in the monsoon.Title: Tech4Dev Sprint: Supporting tech use for non-profits as a collective

==================================================

This blog is written by Sebastian Leidig, from
Aam Digital
This September,
Tech4Dev
has invited us,
Aam Digital
, a few NGOs, and other members of the collective to Dehradun for another one-week “sprint.”
There are already a lot of enthusiastic reports and reflections
on the blog
. I will try to highlight the biggest insights I took away here – and more so the ideas for building upon our collaboration and relationships.
Tech4Dev
is a collective. We are stronger together by being exceptionally open and collaborative as a community. This culture shared among everyone here at
Tech4Dev
is really special.
I am taking two main insights from the many sessions and conversations over this sprint:
Building open source platforms, not custom solutions
:
Pooling resources to develop great software that can be used by many NGOs are at the core of Tech4Dev. And it is the direction where NGOs as well as tech partners here saw the future.
Collaborating as a community of practice
:
Sharing learnings and ideas to achieve our joint vision – technology empowering the social sector – is as important as the products for Tech4Dev. There are invaluable insights for us from this exchange to make tech more useful. And sharing knowledge with other organizations in the social sector about what tech can do (and how to adopt it) is often a missing piece. We could contribute to this.
Platforms instead of custom solutions
Almost all the software systems of our group at
Tech4Dev
–
Avni
,
Glific
,
Dhwani RIS
solutions, and also our own case management platform,
Aam Digital
– apparently started out as rather custom-built systems for specific projects. But everyone here is talking about moving more and more to a product approach. Software that can be configured but doesnt have to be developed from scratch for every NGO. Apart from the cost and maintenance issues, there are also just too many projects in need of digital solutions in the social sector.
But a part of these Tech4Dev platforms also can – and should – be the community to share learnings and help each other beyond the technology.
Helping social organizations understand tech
Swapnil shared Dhwanis approach of how they explain to NGOs what different types of software are available and which areas to think about first. At Aam Digital we have done similar webinars as well. And most of our conversations with NGOs are not about selecting the best software among a few competitors but rather about how to adopt a digital tool in their project for the first time in general.
On the other hand, some NGOs also have a lot of experience in comparing tools and making tech decisions (Vandana from Bhumi really impressed me with their systematic approach).
Tech4Dev has a unique mix of members – software platforms, NGOs, fractional CTOs and other experts (
Gayathri from Women in Tech did a great job highlighting some
). I would love to use this knowledge more to build a deeper understanding for the social sector about what tech can (and cannot) do.
Overall, it was inspiring to hear more about the
origins of Tech4Dev 1.0
and the leaps Tech4Dev 2.0 is making while keeping this amazing culture of openness (also read
Nidhis reflections
). And the discussions during this sprint set some closer collaboration in motion. We are looking forward to becoming a more active member of Tech4Dev with Aam Digital.Title: Tech4Dev announces the availability of Glific v1.0  an open-source, two-way communication platform

==================================================

The AVPN India summit 2019 is one of the larger conferences in the Indian development sector. Over the past three years it has attracted a variety of social organizations, funders, investors, researchers and intermediaries. This year’s conference succeeded in bringing together over four hundred people during one day – November 28, 2019 – in Bengaluru.
The conference featured speakers and panel discussions on several different topics. Among the ones that were relevant to Tech4Dev were the panel discussions on Indian philanthropy which featured Smarinita Shetty from IDR speaking with Radhika Bharat Ram and Amira Shah on “Investing in shared purpose and values through family offices”. The latter’s foundation is a funder to the Tech4Dev initiative. The panelists were refreshingly honest about how they had learnt about the Indian social sector (a lot of experimentation rather than pre-planned design), how they picked the sectors in which to work (a focus on education, or a spread across a range of sectors), and about the kinds of initiatives that they would like Indian funders to support in future (riskier bets versus stable, proven programs). Conversations such as these are particularly relevant for Tech4Dev as we engage, and the NGOs whom we support, work with more Indian funders.
Another discussion that was important for Tech4Dev was the one on “Leveraging data and technology for social inclusion” which featured Swapnil Shekhar from Sambodhi speaking with Deepali Khanna (Rockefeller Foundation), Parag Mehta (Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth) and Prashant Mehra (Mindtree). Some of the points that stood out were the assertions that we faced a generational challenge in terms of data inequality, and that it was pointless to talk about social inclusion without addressing this challenge. This is a view that fits squarely with Tech4Dev’s drive to make code and data as open as is possible. The topics that the speakers covered included the Data Science for Social Impact Collaborative which Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard had set up together, and which would include a USD 50 million fund, and the platforms which Mindtree has been building for the use of farmers.
Other panel discussions covered interesting topics such as regulations in the Indian development sector and how to build leadership within organizations. A number of good conversations were had with representatives of NGOs who were interested in learning about Tech4Dev and about how they could apply, as well as those from intermediaries that worked with NGOs and funding agencies.
Tech4Dev is a topic that sparks conversation quickly. What we as a group will need to continue to reflect upon is how best to participate in such conferences. Should we, for example, always try to present our work and what we have learned, by hosting sessions, giving talks or organising training sessions? What are the circumstances under which we should just attend and look for networking opportunities? As we continue to engage with others in the development sector, we will refine our model of engagement so as to provide and derive the most value for the initiative and the partner software firms and NGOs.Title: Tech4Dev session at the Dasra Philanthropy Week

==================================================

The Dasra Philanthropy Week (DPW) was held in the week of
the 24
th
Feb, with a breakout session for Tech4Dev on 29
th
Feb. DPW is an annual convening of non-profit leaders, philanthropists,
foundations, policymakers and other key stakeholders to discuss the way forward
for India?s development. In addition to the plenary sessions, there were
multiple breakout sessions.
The session on Tech4Dev was for highlighting the value that
technology brings to the social impact space, discussing how it allows
non-profits to improve efficiency in their operations and listen to their
beneficiaries better, and enhance the overall impact on the sector. The session
comprised a 30 min panel discussion followed by forty-five minutes of software
solution demos to an audience of around forty people. The audience was a mix of
philanthropists and funders, NGOs, and software providers.
The panel discussion was moderated by Prapti Patel from
Dasra and comprised Insiyah Rangwala from Antarang Foundation, Arun Kadekodi
from Soft-Corner and me, from Lumen Consulting. The panel discussion revolved
around the origins of Tech4Dev, the problems it is aiming to solve, experience
of NGOs and software partners working with each other, and the challenges of
scaling up such a platform going forward.
The demos had a format similar to speed-dating with staff
from four organizations ? Samanvay Foundation, Noora Health, Indus Action, and
Antarang Foundation – manning a desk each and a cluster of 8-10 people
interacting with each organization for 10 minutes before moving on to the next
desk.
Vivek and Arjun from Samanvay Foundation talked
about their open source field
service and data collection platform ? Avni
Arjun Rangarajan from Noora Health talked of using Whatsapp for
training patients and their families with high-impact health skills to improve
outcomes
Mahua Bisht and Tarun Cherukuri from Indus Action demoed
their technology solution for ensuring implementation of the Right to Education
provisions across schools in India
Insiyah Rangwala from Antarang Foundation shared insights on
using technology for their CareerAware and CareeReady programs.
The response to both the panel discussion and the demos was
positive, as evidenced by the conversations happening after the demos between
the members of the audience and the panellists as well as the demo staff.
Some of the interesting questions I got during my
conversations:
1. How can we use Tech4Dev open source platforms for
technology in agriculture?
2. What does Tech4Dev think of a SAAS subscription model?
3. Why don?t you (ie. Tech4Dev) think of creating scrips for
leveraging the existing capabilities of Google Docs, Tableau, Power BI, etc and
upload these scrips for free use?
Some feedback on the session from others:
1. There could have been more time allocated to the session
with some time left for Q&A after the pane discussion as well as the demos
2. Most people could visit only three demos and not all
four, so maybe we could have allocated more time for the demos. (However, the
time allocated was by design for keeping the demos to a short elevator pitch
style format.)
3. A little more structured networking would have helped.Title: Tech4Devs F CxO Program with Indus Action- Ankit Saxena

==================================================

Indus Action (IA)
works towards bridging the gap between policy and action by easing welfare access to
vulnerable citizens. IAs vision is to consolidate India’s 500+ low-impact welfare schemes into 5-10
high-impact and accessible schemes, called the Power [Portfolio of Welfare & Entitlement Rights]. IAs
goal is to support 1,000,000 families with Power benefits by 2025.
Image courtesy: Indus Action website
IA has been leveraging tech to solve key challenges around welfare access. Last year, leadership observed that they were facing challenges around completing key tech projects. They also felt that there was an absence of a sound tech strategy that was aligned with their org strategy. With PoWER as a 2025 goal, tech became an even more of a key strategic lever for them. When IA got introduced to fCXO, they found it potentially addressing the tech challenges; they enrolled for the program & I was assigned as their fCXO.
My journey started with spending the first month doing deep conversations with different stakeholders
within the organisation – the leadership and program teams (both leads and associates). Through these
conversations I gained valuable insights into the different programs, their strategy, and challenges. This
initial phase was crucial in developing a comprehensive understanding of the organisation. At the end of
first month, I presented my assessment of the org challenges and priorities along with my planned
approach to tackle them in the upcoming months.
As I delved deeper into the programs and engaged with team members, I realised that in most cases the
root cause of the challenge was broken tech processes and an imbalance in tech team. Tech team didnt
have the right number of project managers to effectively handle projects with the government. The critical role of product manager had not been considered by the org before. Developers were spread thin juggling between the development tasks and project management responsibilities. From a process perspective, there were significant gaps in aligning tech teams work with other departments, and important discussions happened verbally without proper documentation and tracking. To address all of these issues, I took immediate action by personally overseeing key projects, while simultaneously focusing on devising a long term tech strategy and improvements in tech processes.
So far, the journey has been both challenging and rewarding. We successfully implemented the first version of PoWER platform in Delhi. I am pleased that IA team has been very receptive to suggestions and changes proposed, making the progress smoother. To further strengthen the development and expansion of the project, we hired a skilled product manager who would drive the vision, strategy, and projects for PoWER. However, hiring and retaining a capable tech team remains a big challenge that I plan to address by having a combination of inhouse team and reliable vendors, thereby ensuring the project’s continued success.
Looking forward, my focus will be on developing an exit strategy for the fCXO program and transitioning
out within the next few months. I am positive that with the system and process changes we have
implemented and along with the tech strategy we have put in place, it has laid a solid foundation for IA to
achieve its desired welfare outcomes. Technology will continue to play a vital role as an enabler in IAs
journey and I feel confident that it is now well equipped to thrive even without the fCXO program.

==================================================

Meet Narasamma who works with
Jagrutha Mahila Sanghatane (JMS)
– a small, growing and impactful collective of inspiring dalit women agricultural workers engaged in the protection and promotion of human rights of dalit women. She speaks about how technology is helping document and measure the impact of her work at JMS.
Grassroots and remote NGOs like JMS, are either not collecting any data about their work or have been collecting data on paper. Such paper data is difficult to aggregate and analyse in any meaningful way. For example, It will take Narasamma?s team many days to go through paper forms of 1000 beneficiaries of a programme and find out who is yet to receive a crucial counselling session from her team. This is time that could have been spent meaningfully on other important work. There are also instances of paper files being completely destroyed during natural calamities like fire, cyclone. Imagine having evidence and documentation of decades of impactful work being wiped out like that.
A good collection, aggregation and analysis of programme data can help NGOs to optimize their services to beneficiaries and improve the quality of outcomes. Donors are also increasingly asking NGOs to measure and share the impact of their work through data collected from programmes. Good data practices can help NGOs communicate the evidence of their impact to donors and increase access to much needed funds.
NGOs believe that such robust data platforms are expensive, hard to learn and maintain. This is not true anymore! As Narasamma so beautifully says – today technology is leveling the playground for everyone. Whether you are illiterate or a researcher, a global NGO or a small NGO with no resources – technologies like smartphones and apps are helping them amplify their social impact like never before.

Author: Ashwin Srinivasan
Date: July 2024
Category: Fractional CxO
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tech4impact-a-vehicle-for-ecosystem-building/
==================================================

Tech ecosystem building for the social sector is core to the vision and mission of Project Tech4Dev. A strong vibrant, collaborative and open ecosystem enables the entire sector to move faster at a lower price point.
Towards this end, in April 2024, Project Tech4Dev hosted its inaugural Tech4Impact event in Bengaluru. Unlike our regular sprints which involve NGO participants from all disciplines, this event was exclusively for technical experts and leaders working in the sector. We had enthusiastic participation from over 100 representatives of non-profit organisations, tech companies, and social enterprises.
The event was designed as a platform for learning, networking, and collaboration. It featured plenary sessions from industry leaders, as well as interactive roundtables run by community members on a range of topics such as leveraging data for social impact, advancements in LLMs and their use, and hiring / retaining technical talent. We also had a panel discussion with funders to get their perspective on how to pitch innovative technical ideas and initiatives.
Most importantly, the event left a lot of time and space for technical leaders in the sector to connect, engage and interact with each other. Often, people in roles such as CTO for a non-profit organisation are heavily burdened with the responsibilities their organisations throw at them, and don?t have sufficient time or opportunity to spar and exchange ideas with technical folks facing similar challenges. We hope that Tech4Impact will help foster serendipitous connections that will help move the ecosystem forward.
Challenges of Ecosystem Building
Vibrant technical ecosystems facilitate innovation, enhance resource efficiency, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement. However, the journey to building such ecosystems for the social sector is challenging for many reasons.
Funding and Resourcing Challenges
One of the primary hurdles is securing adequate funding and resources. The demand for software professionals and related fields in the commercial sector is high, often accompanied by competitive salaries that nonprofits struggle to match. This disparity makes it challenging for social sector organisations and the vendors serving them to attract and retain skilled technical talent.
Limited Pool of Experienced Vendors
Another significant challenge is the limited pool of vendors with deep experience in the social sector. Building this expertise takes time, and the scarcity of experienced partners can slow down the adoption and effective use of technology within nonprofits. There are definitely good vendors with a commitment to the sector, many of whom attended the Tech4Impact event, but the size of the vendor pool doesn?t match the demands of the sector. Furthermore, these vendors struggle with the same challenges as NGOs to hire and retain great technical talent. Up-levelling the expertise of existing vendors and adding new vendors to the available pool serving the social sector in the face of these constraints is challenging.
Ecosystem Must become Self-Sustaining
For an ecosystem to be sustainable, it must grow organically over time. This means fostering an environment where initiatives and collaborations naturally flourish, where everyone is motivated to contribute and assist each other independent of ongoing support from individual organizations like Project Tech4Dev. Ensuring the ecosystem’s growth and self-sufficiency is a complex task that requires alignment of vision and incentives, as well as careful shepherding.
What?s next
Even keeping these challenges in mind, we are going to take Tech4Impact forward in a big way through:
Regular Online Sessions:
Facilitating regular online Tech4Impact sessions to keep the community connected and provide opportunities for technical leaders from different organisations to share their experiences and insights. The first such session was run on July 18th with presentations by ImpactHire and CivicDataLab. Keep your eyes open for our next session in late August.
Face-to-Face Events:
Organising periodic face-to-face events in different cities for deeper engagement. These events will allow for more meaningful interactions and stronger network building among participants.
Intensive 2025 Event:
Planning a more intensive event in 2025 with the aim to dive deep into addressing systemic challenges that have thus far been hard to resolve. This event will focus on creating actionable solutions and long-term strategies.
Synthesizing Sector Learnings:
Synthesising our learning about the sector and the challenges organisations face through various initiatives, including Fractional CxO engagements, and cohort programs like the Data Catalyst Program. These insights will be applied to develop solutions useful to multiple organisations.
Partnerships for Scaling Digital Public Goods:
Wherever possible, Tech4Dev aims to partner with NGOs, funding organisations, and other technical partners to identify, pilot, refine, and scale digital public goods. These collaborations will help in creating scalable and sustainable solutions that can benefit the broader social sector.
The success of the first Tech4Impact event in Bengaluru is a promising start towards building a dynamic ecosystem that empowers social sector organisations with the technical capabilities needed to amplify their impact. But we are only getting started and there is much more to come ?Title: Techie? Questioning life choices? Keen on switching to the social sector?
Author: Donald Lobo
Date: November 2023
Category: Tech4Dev 2.0
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/techie-questioning-life-choices-keen-on-switching-to-the-social-sector/
==================================================

Over the past 18 months, I’ve had lots of conversations with folks specifically from the tech/corporate sector who’ve expressed an interest in switching to the social sector. We’ve had some amazing successes with a few of them (here’s to you: Vinod, Ashwin, Rajeev, Ashwini, Thomas and Radhika!), a few failures and a a fair number in between. The below post is our experience, learning and approach, what has worked well, and what we can improve on. We wrap it up with some pieces of advice and links to a few blog posts and reading material.
We recently wrapped up a hiring spree for senior tech folks where we hired three senior people from the tech + data world to join us full time. One of them works from the San Francisco Bay Area (like me), and we had to figure out how we could match her goals with our needs. So lots of interesting conversations, a few stumbles and definitely lots of learning. Figured I’d write down some of our learnings and how we’ll approach this the next time, for our future selves, when we do our next hiring spree. All of the stumbles below are mine, hopefully this will help others (and me) from repeating some of my mistakes, and build on some of the things that worked well for us.
Be clear with your communications and expectations. We should let people know that while we really want to get more people in the sector and encourage the switch, we are also running a fairly large NGO with commitments to our users and funders. We have a budget, we have positions we need to fill. While I am happy to experiment and roll the dice many a case, we need to balance this with our immediate needs and goals.
While folks from the tech industry bring important skills to the table, it does not transfer completely to the social sector. There is a learning curve, there is an understanding of the space that needs to be built up, there is exploration that needs to be done. If you’ve not spent a fair number of hours working with NGOs on any aspect, the first step is to volunteer with a local NGO and get to understand the sector better
One of our recent hires, volunteered with us for three months or so, before he was willing to commit to a full time role and we were comfortable knowing how he could help us. It seems like a long time, but it did work out really well. A few of our other recent hires, have spent a fair bit of time exploring with other local NGOs, participating in hack-a-thons and more.
While we would like to hire all the folks interested in making the switch, we also need to make sure that we know how we could use them, we have work lined up for them, and we can fit them into our budget and funding cycles. Ultimately, we need to raise money for each and every hire, something that is not trivial
There is a big difference between accepting a volunteer vs considering someone for a full time role. In our experience, around 1/2 of the volunteers drop out in the first month or earlier. We try to limit the amount of time we invest in them, but give them more open-ended projects where they can make independent progress. A good example would be to work on a feature that will be useful to our NGOs , but not super-urgent. People who we end up working with have taken the initiative and made some progress on these projects.
We need to ensure we have a process for engaging volunteers in a meaningful way, without it being a significant load on the team member. Have a clear specific deliverable that they can make progress on independently. Ensure someone on the team spends an hour or so with them per week whenever needed.
We used to be very open and welcoming to folks attending our sprints and gatherings. As we’ve grown as a team and as our commitments have increased, it’s really hard for us to accommodate other folks unless we know what they can bring to the table. If you’ve volunteered with us, and we know your skill set, it makes it a lot easier to have you be part of the sprint and contribute to what we want to achieve. At our most recent sprint, our biggest feedback was team members were too busy with various tasks, that we did not get to engage with each other as much as we’d like. Being a remote-first organization, these week-long meetings are super important for the team to catch up and address some large problems.
Going forward to make it easier for all of us, we’ve decided to allocate one day at the sprint for visitors and funders. They get to meet the team in person, interact with the community and see what we do. Easier for us to manage and ensure that we can be good hosts.

Some words of advice for folks who might be considering a switch to the social sector (derived from the above points, so a bit of a repeat here)
If you’ve not volunteered with an NGO, go volunteer with a few for 20-30 hours / week for a few weeks
Think of it as a mutually beneficial association. While the sector can potentially use your skills, the sector is looking for people who can help them sooner rather than later. The more you understand and empathize with the organization, the better it works for everyone. Ultimately think of this as a job / career search, you have to be more vested in it.
Take the initiative, follow up if needed. Send folks a reminder email, sometimes things fall off our plate and we forget to respond.
Ask questions, jump on public channels if available (for tech4dev this is our discord channel, or GitHub repos) along with the multiple webinars we have) where you can help. See what is happening, Get involved in an open source way, if you can.
Attend as many events as you potentially can. You get to know the people, talk to other folks in the sector, see the dynamics. It may or may not be your cup of tea or coffee. This gives you a chance to explore

==================================================

On Sunday, Nov 14, we had 21 folks from 9 organizations descend into Dehradun airport from across 8 Cities in India, from San Francisco and Germany for the Tehri Sprint. We were met by Tushar Bohra from ColoredCow who was the lead organizer and facilitator of this event. The first order of business was getting everyone tested for good ole Covid. We then piled into 3 vehicles for the 3 hour drive to Tehri.
We were welcomed to Tehri by Prateek and the rest of the ColoredCow team with a nice yummy dinner. Most of us were meeting for the first time in person, and it was a really good feeling to chat and interact with people after such a long time.

Sprint Participants on the hike
Day 1
The ColoredCow team works from THDC University(and thanks for their support with the sprint) in a really nice setting along with an ample supply of tea, coffee and snacks through the day. We have all our meals at the office and are well fed by the kitchen staff with great food. We also asked participants to get some treats for the group from their home location and were treated to a wide variety of treats and sweets that I suspect will last us for a couple of days. We’ve set up a nice corner for all the treats which is a host to people meeting and interacting with each other- a whole new spin to water cooler conversations.
Kitchen in action preparing evening soup
It was great to see quite a few folks up and about in the morning and going for a run, walk, exercising and hoping to see the sun rise from the mountains. The clouds thwarted it this morning, but we have quite a few more days for that to happen.
We started off the sprint with a round of introductions and learning something interesting about each participant. Pankaj(PK) showed off his amazing memory skills by recalling the name of all the participants at the end of the introduction round. The group split up and collaborated with their team members on their respective projects. At the end of the day Akshay from
Rainmatter
gave the group an overview of
Caprover
– an open source Platform as a Service (PasS) tool and Pankaj talked about
Glific
.
For sunset, we managed to convince most of the group to take a short walk up to the local temple. Vivek from ColoredCow who was largely instrumental in setting up the Tehri office and is a local gave us a tour and overview of the area along with details on life before and after the dam. The view from the house where he grew up was incredible.

We hope that over the next few days, people from different organisations will get a chance to interact and learn from each other’s work. And we’re eagerly looking forward to daily tech talks and deep dives from the group.Title: Tehri Social Impact Sprint – Day 2

==================================================

This blog post is written by Simon(Aam Digital) and Prateek(Dost Education).
The second day of the Social Impact Sprint started for some people with a nice 90 minute walk from the huts to the university. Its a very pretty area with some beautiful views of the landscape, especially from the university which is located on a hill.
Tech Talks
After a delicious breakfast we gathered for the daily tech session where two organizations are presenting their projects. Today it was
Dost Education
and
Aam Digitals
turn.
Prateek and Satendra presented Dost Educations. Dost works with parents of young kids to teach them about the importance of Early Childhood Development and how they can improve it. Parents join the Dost program and get daily short automated voice calls to learn about a new topic every week. We saw how their tech works and they use analytics to drive various decisions.
Aam Digital is a web application targeted to the needs of smaller NGOs that have difficulties managing their daily information. The users can easily register new beneficiaries, add notes about program activities or record attendance. At the same time Aam Digital displays the data in a user friendly way which allows project managers to get a quick overview of their program activities and plan their activities data driven. The data collected on the daily bases can then also be exported to donors to give a broader overview on the impact of the project.
Daily Routines
For the rest of the day the participants are free to work on whatever they want. There are always a lot of people having video calls, some are in an intense coding session and there is always a small group chatting in the coffee corner. However, the best thing about the sprint is meeting up with people from other organizations, understanding how they are working, what their current challenges and learnings are and to find out how we can profit from each other and create a greater impact.
During lunch a nice conversation about Open Source took place where we discussed the challenges and opportunities of software developers making their source code publicly available. It was interesting to hear about the different reasons why organizations decided to go open source and how they are engaging others to contribute.
In the afternoon a smaller group went for another walk to visit some of the beautiful viewpoints around the university.
Deep Dive
After presenting their project the day before, some developers of the Gliffic team gave a deep dive session on their own software architecture and how they are using and integrating with Googles Big Query and Data Studio. It was very interesting to hear how they are cooperating with the NGOs to build data dashboards and their partners are used to working with Data Studio.
Tearing Down
As the day was setting, the chilling began. Some people learnt how to make coffee, some had a nice game of dart, some went for short rides on skateboards and scooters. The day ended with another delicious dinner, some nice sweets and a relaxed birthday celebration for Sebastian, one of the participants.Title: Tehri Social Impact Sprint – Day 3

==================================================

This blogpost is written by the IDinsight team(Victor, Tanmay, Suzin, Lavanya, Adam, Zia).
On the third day of the Tehri Social Impact Sprint, we woke up (as usual) to the dazzling view in front of our cabins. The lake, the mountains, the early morning sun, all come together to paint a beautiful picture for us everyday. We are greeted by excited tail wagging dogs, eager to give us handshakes. We will miss all this so much when we leave 🙁
After gathering the willpower to leave our beds and get ready for day 3, we came to our, now beloved, THDC university. The ride to the university was the same as days 1 and 2 – everyone was squished together, listening to
Lover by Diljeet Dosanjh
(our trip anthem) in the Innova.
Gastro Section
A major highlight of the Social Impact Sprint has been the food. It is prepared with love and care by Praksh Ji. Day 3, however, had special meals in store for us. Yes, even better than usual –
Cheelas, eggs, lentil salad for breakfast. The perfect meal to start off our day
Rajma, rice, pickles, and curd for lunch. Rajma is love. Rajma is life.
Idlis and Dosas for dinner, thanks to a special, super secret recipe from Gautams Grandma!
We are sure that everyone has gained a couple of kilograms since the sprint began 😉
Tech Talks
The days 1st tech talk was given by the IDinsight team. IDinsight uses data and evidence to help leaders combat poverty worldwide. Their collaborations deploy a large analytical toolkit to help clients design better policies, rigorously test what works, and use evidence to implement effectively at scale. They gave everyone a taste (almost as tasty as Praksh Jis cooking) of the wide variety of work they do. Their work ranges all the way from building cool dashboards to deploying machine learning models!
The 2nd talk of day 3 was given by Plio. Their presentation was one of the most fun and interesting ones so far (a considerable feat given how exciting all of the other talks have been!). The Plio team showed us how their product works to convert YouTube videos to Plios which are interactive videos that people can use for all sorts of things. Everyone got to make our own Plios as well. The memes and GIFs they used in their presentation stole the show!
The deep dive was given by Aam Digital who talked about their open source project for case management for NGOs. They gave a walkthrough of how their technology helps streamline teaching practices. It was inspiring hearing the story of their start-up.
Story Club
Story club is a weekly open mic event that ColoredCow hosts in their office every Wednesday. We had the chance to take part in it this week. The theme for this week was celebrating individual growth and achievements in life and acknowledging the importance of supportive mentors. A lot of people shared their experiences talking about how they overcame their doubts and insecurities, how they found support and inspiration in unexpected places, and how they fell in love with their work. It was very heartwarming to see people being honest and connecting with everyone at a deeper level. It was an inspiring night, leaving us much to think about.Title: Tehri Social Impact Sprint – Day 4

==================================================

The day began with the sun in the sky and only a few clouds – and it was quite chilly and cold. Overall, a beautiful day. Today was our day for a hike. So we got up early, got ready and walked towards the office from the guest house. The walk from the guest house to the office is a steep climb and we were a bit out of breath. We had our breakfast at our desks. For today’s breakfast, we had cabbage paratha accompanied by eggs, pickles, toast and hot tea. After having breakfast, we discussed a little bit about the days schedule and embarked on the hike.
The Hike
Everyone was pumped up and we began with a renewed energy after breakfast. Akhilesh and Shumon were our guides, as they were the only ones who knew the way. Our hike was from the office to Auli Chai to New Tehri. Everything was good in the beginning, but as we went up the hill, the route became slightly difficult. Lobo motivated us all to keep going. After 2 hours or so, we had covered half the trek route.
We reached New Tehri from where we saw a wonderful view. After stopping there for a while and absorbing the view, we started our trek again. From here, we reached New Tehri Market where there were many simple shops vending fruits, clothes, food etc. After walking another hour we reached Auli Chai.
After reaching Ali Chai and resting a while, we ordered food for everyone. The view made up for all the exhaustion and it was really beautiful up there. Needless to say, the food was great too. We spent about 3 hours here and started back for the office.
The return was relatively simpler and it did not take us very long to reach the office.
Hike to Aulichai
Tech Talk
After the lovely hike and afternoon tea, we began with the Tech Talk. The first presentation was
Shelter Associates
. Amar Kamthe & Kuldeep Lodha made a presentation on behalf of Shelter Associates. Shelter Associates is a Civil Society Organization (CSO) established in 1994 to improve the living conditions of the urban poor in India. Shelter has been using data and especially spatial data to map poverty. Amar and Kuldeep explained how the shelter visualizes the data using the dashboard that they have developed. They also talked about their One Home One Toilet mission.
The next presentation was from the Dhwani RIS team.
Dhwani RIS
is a development-oriented technology enterprise envisioned to provide affordable, integrated, and smart ICT tools to organizations working at BoP levels. The Presentation was about Mform. Mform is a dynamic data collection and data visualization platform developed by Dhwani.
Shelter Associates
and
Dhwani RIS
presentation
Deep Dive
Today’s deep-dive session was organized by Aman Dalmiya of Avanti Fellows. Aman gave a talk on AI for Social Good where he shared his learnings from his experience at Wadhwani AI (prior to Plio & Avanti Fellows).
Bonfire Night
After these engaging sessions, we all left for the eco huts. Here, the Colored Cow team had organized the Bonfire Party. It was wonderful with drinks, barbeque and food on one side and people were around a bonfire. Lot of performances from the participants including playing musical instruments, singing songs, reciting poems even stand up comedy made the evening very lively!
Bonfire
What a day and what an evening with hiking, learning and enjoying with friends! We should have more events like these!Title: Tehri Sprint

This article was written by Kartik and Team Dhwani.
Here comes the Tehri Social Impact Sprint, which booked my calendar for an auspicious and wonderful event that started from 14th November 2021 to 20th November 2021.
Kartik(Me), Shahjad, Amresh, Manju were representing our organization Dhwani Rural Information Systems. We had lots of hopes and desire to share our expertise in the field of technology. We were seeking help to seek our doubts and use cases which we are trying to solve with the help of Mform, so we got the path of Tehri Social Impact Sprint.
The event was held at THDC University, Tehri, also the office of ColoredCow founded by Prateek Narang. We were welcomed by a highly enthusiastic, motivated and self intrinsic team of ColoredCow, and then waiting for other folks to join us.
Now, the ice breaking session with the help of candle light dinner was the perfect beginning of the sprint. We headed to GMVN Eco Huts Tehri Lake(Stays) and witnessed the heart touching Sun rise the next morning. The rays of sunlight were brightening high as like ours to learn something new out of the box.
We were collaborating with IDInsights, Aam Digital, ColoredCow, Several NGOs, techies, Glific, Dost Education and few others. As the event went on and days passed, we were getting lots of confidence regarding the work we have done so far and could see that we are in a good direction.
Here are few moments which we had captured during the Sprint:
We went on a trek to Auli Cafe(New tehri) headed by ColoredCow team and the motivation of Donald Lobo to reach the Cafe and enjoy hills.
This was the mesmerizing view of Tehri Dam, which was our office view and helped us to refresh and feel energetic the whole day.
The major learning which we had were:
Work is always ongoing, focus on overall development also
Employees shall be happy and ice breaking sessions are always helpful
Focus on long term solutions rather than short term fixes
Open source contributions are must to do things, this helps to know new technologies
Challenges are big, but can be achieved with great directionTitle: Tehri Visit

The Glific team sent an email out inviting anyone interested to join them and the ColoredCow team at Tehri, Uttarakhand for a week long sprint. In the words of Donald Lobo, it had 2 goals – give the developers a break, while allowing them to just converse and see if anything meaningful emerges.
Culture is Omnipresent
From making us feel at home, to teaching us how to make coffee to make dashboards or celebrate every moment, the team showed me what excellence is. No effort was spared to make us experience excellence, from all members of their team. So it felt like excellence was the culture
Collaboration over Deep Dives
This is from a mapping session. We can see 5 organisations participating in understanding how to make map based dashboards better. Not only was the conversation on tech, but on data analysis and approach, making it a comprehensive conversation, of value to everyone who attended. Such deep dives happened everyday. I learnt that time for conversations is invaluable to collaborate, and develop multiple perspectives.
Pause. Relax. Talk
Food was brilliant. It was excellent. It allowed us to connect to one another. A colleague from South India gave a flavour of South Indian food. The cook, Prakashji and his team gave us an experience of pahadi dishes. The team got ghee, pickle and more from home and made it a delicious visit.
I realised the power of how to build communities. One way is by excellent food brought together from many homes.
Celebration
One forgets to celebrate and be grateful. Not one night did we not celebrate something. Wonderful way to bring people together at the end of a long and tough day!
Great work Environs
Night or day, the scenery around us was breath taking. I have never taken so many walks. Neither have I been so awestruck by such diversity in beauty of nature.
Great work environs is a great way to beat stress daily 😉
Team time
Regular treks allowed each of to connect on various things – from lack of fitness, to a myriad range of topics we spoke of on the many treks we took.
Sharing
Story telling was a beautiful way to connect to one’s journey, and to them. This gave people a chance to be authentic and vulnerable. No better way to build a ‘we’ feeling!
What did I learn?
One simple conversation between Lobo and the ColoredCow team allowed for a set of organisations to come together for this sprint. This is the power of an idea. Given so many great experiences, learning, growth, collaboration were inevitable. I got a chance to learn a range of skills – from coffee making, to writing better code.
I got to experience the simplicity of building a community. While it did feel easy, its a testimony to the efforts of the ColoredCow Team and Glific Team behind the scenes to plan everything. But for a change, with so many of their team just including us, the visitors in their daily routines, it was so easy to keep us engaged and awestruck.
If this is something we could replicate, I can assure anyone that great communities can be born, and deep, meaningful impact will result in many spheres of day to day life across the country and maybe world.
It was also a takeaway for me on how to build teams and organisations. Everyone was an ambassador for the org, using their own ways of championing what I took as the one value everyone and the hosts (ColoredCow & Glific) exhibited – Excellence as a way of life.Title: Text to SQL exploration continues – WrenAI

==================================================

This write up talks about
WrenAI
and then compares it to a popular tool
Vanna.ai
(Source of all pictures in this blog is WrenAI’s website).
Motivation
In the past few months, we have explored a few text to sql OSS tools out there in the hopes to leverage one in
Dalgo
and make it available to our NGOs. We reckon this will help the MnE (Monitoring & Evaluation) folks or the analysts in the NGOs, to focus more on the metrics of their program and eliminate time spent in figuring out sql transformations, statements, complex joins etc.
These are some of the write ups we did on this topic of text to sql
Exploring Vanna ai
Vanna ai vs Askametric
If you are interested in an understanding Tech4dev’s overall AI strategy – you can check out this
Project Tech4Dev’s AI Strategy
WrenAI Architecture
Using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with LLMs to query databases is a very common practice now, however this method still has its problems/limitations in terms of understanding the context or the business logic around the data. WrenAI tries to tackle these problems
The picture below shows the architecture of WrenAI.
Source –
WrenAI
There are 3 components of WrenAI
UI – interface to ask questions to your data source
AI service – retrieving the context from vector db and prompting the LLM happens here
Engine – responsible for connecting to datasource, making sure the SQL executed is in the correct dialect as of the data source, and working out the semantics/metadata of the source.
Setting up WrenAI
They have an installation script that you can easily run and get started (check
here
). However if you want to have more control over parameters and maybe play around & poke into their open source code you can do the following
Clone their
repo
Inside the docker directory, create the .env.local file from .env.example
Add your open ai key in the .env.local. If you want to run a custom llm you will need to copy .env.ai.example to a new .env.ai and add the respective keys there.
Run this docker-compose –env-file .env.local up -d to start all the Wren services. By default it starts at
http://localhost:3000
1 . As soon as you open the UI it asks you to set up a data source.
2. It will ask you to select the table(s) that you want to process and query/ask questions on.
3. In the last step, it will ask you to set up relationships between your database tables. It takes the first shot at this automatically by looking at the database’s metadata/schema (primary/foreign keys). You can further add description, business logic to not only the tables but also the relationships. This makes the llm more context aware.

Results
For the experiment I am trying to see if I can get accurate results for Dalgo’s operations report that has around 10-15 metrics which we compute weekly. Wren AI claims & guarantees that it only sends metadata and not actual data so there is no risk of PII information being fed to LLMs. For each question, i compare the output from WrenAI and Vanna.ai
Q1. Can you tell how many flow runs failed in the week from 8/17/2024 to 8/24/2024
WrenAI
It gives you the possible interpretation of your question by the system and you can select anyone from it. I selected the third option and it gave me this answer which was very correct and accurate.
Answer
WITH
  failed_flow_runs_data AS
  -- Selects flow_run_ids from the _prefectflowrun table where the state is 'Failed' and the expected start time is within the specified date range.
  (
    SELECT
      "flow_run_id"
    FROM
      "public_ddpui_prefectflowrun" AS "_prefectflowrun"
    WHERE
      "state_name" = 'Failed'
      AND "expected_start_time" >= '2024-08-17'
      AND "expected_start_time" < '2024-08-25'
  )
  -- Counts the number of flow_run_ids from the filtered data to determine the total number of failed flow runs.
SELECT
  COUNT("flow_run_id") AS "failed_flow_runs"
FROM
  "failed_flow_runs_data"
You can ask follow up questions to it and it also has the concept of threads.
WrenAI takes an extra step to improve accuracy of the sql generated.
It validates the sql being generated by the llm by running it. If there is any error, it again sends it back to the llm for modifications. This is done in a continuous loop until it gets to an accurate sql that runs correctly in the source’s database/dialect.
Vanna.ai
Answer
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM ddpui_prefectflowrun 
WHERE state_name = 'failed' 
AND start_time >= '2024-08-17' 
AND start_time < '2024-08-25';
If you notice, it got the state_name wrong. It should have been Failed instead of failed. Wren AI was successfully able to do that.
I gave the correct query by changing failed to Failed so it has more context for the next question. Vanna ai takes this and generates a new embedding
Q1.1 (Follow up) How many dataflows or pipelines or deployment failed during the week from 8/17/2024 to 8/24/2024  A pipeline is considered to have failed during the week if there is at least one failed flow run during that time period.
WrenAI
Answer
WITH
  failed_deployments_data AS
  -- Selects deployment IDs from the _prefectflowrun table where the state is 'Failed' and the expected start time is within the specified range.
  (
    SELECT
      "deployment_id"
    FROM
      "public_ddpui_prefectflowrun" AS "_prefectflowrun"
    WHERE
      "state_name" = 'Failed'
      AND "expected_start_time" >= '2024-08-17'
      AND "expected_start_time" < '2024-08-25'
  )
  -- Counts the distinct deployment IDs from the filtered data to determine the number of failed deployments.
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT "deployment_id") AS "failed_deployments"
FROM
  "failed_deployments_data"
This answer is a bit off, it’s supposed to join with another pipelines table before counting the failures. I did not update the description in the relationship so I guess it didn’t understand the full context.
I updated the metadata (super easy step from the UI itself) description for the ddpui_prefectflowrun table and also re-phrased the question to see if it could get the join this time.
Vanna.ai
Answer
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT deployment_id) 
FROM ddpui_prefectflowrun 
WHERE state_name = 'Failed' 
AND start_time >= '2024-08-17' 
AND start_time < '2024-08-25';
This is again a bit off but it gave the same answer as WrenAI. An additional join with the dataflows/pipelines table is missing.
I re-trained vanna.ai with some context about the relation between flow run tables and data flow/pipeline tables. This is what i added to its db_description
The field deployment_id ddpui_prefectflowrun can used to map flow runs to pipelines/dataflows in ddpui_orgdataflowv1
This is the exact same description i added in WrenAI’s model for the deployment_id
Q1.2 (Follow up) Can you give me the name of the dataflow and the count of failed flow runs during the week mentioned above
WrenAI
Answer
-- Counts distinct failed flow runs for each dataflow, ensuring no duplicates are counted.
SELECT
  "_orgdataflow"."name" AS "dataflow_name",
  COUNT(DISTINCT "_prefectflowrun"."flow_run_id") AS "failed_flow_runs"
FROM
  "public_ddpui_prefectflowrun" AS "_prefectflowrun"
  JOIN "public_ddpui_orgdataflowv1" AS "_orgdataflow" ON "_prefectflowrun"."deployment_id" = "_orgdataflow"."deployment_id"
WHERE
  "_prefectflowrun"."state_name" = 'Failed'
  AND "_prefectflowrun"."expected_start_time" >= '2024-08-17'
  AND "_prefectflowrun"."expected_start_time" < '2024-08-25'
GROUP BY
  "_orgdataflow"."name"
It got the query right this time.
Vanna.ai
Answer
SELECT 
    deployment_id AS pipeline_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS failed_flow_run_count
FROM 
    ddpui_prefectflowrun
WHERE 
    state_name = 'Failed' 
    AND start_time >= '2024-08-17' 
    AND start_time < '2024-08-26'
GROUP BY 
    deployment_id;
Doesn’t look right, it’s almost the same answer as the previous one. Maybe vanna.ai needs more context but WrenAI does a great due to its Semantic modeling layer in between
Q2. For all connections in the “Dalgo Demo” org, can you tell the average sync duration over the last two months for each one
WrenAI
Answer
WITH
  filtered_org AS
  -- Selects the organization ID and name from the public_ddpui_org table where the organization name matches 'Dalgo Demo'.
  (
    SELECT
      "org"."id" AS "org_id",
      "org"."name" AS "org_name"
    FROM
      "public_ddpui_org" AS "org"
    WHERE
      LOWER("org"."name") = LOWER('Dalgo Demo')
  ),
  filtered_sync_data AS
  -- Joins the filtered organization data with the synchronization statistics to get connection IDs and their corresponding sync durations for the last 60 days.
  (
    SELECT
      "dds"."connection_id" AS "connection_id",
      "dds"."sync_duration_s" AS "sync_duration_s"
    FROM
      "public_ddpui_syncstats" AS "dds"
      JOIN "filtered_org" AS "org" ON "dds"."org_id" = "org"."org_id"
    WHERE
      "dds"."sync_time" >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '60' DAY
  )
  -- Calculates the average synchronization duration for each connection ID from the filtered synchronization data.
SELECT
  "connection_id",
  AVG("sync_duration_s") AS "average_sync_duration"
FROM
  "filtered_sync_data"
GROUP BY
  "connection_id"
This was correct. If you see it has broken down the question into steps and uses CTE to build the query.
Vanna.ai
Answer
SELECT connection_id, AVG(sync_duration_s) AS average_sync_duration
FROM ddpui_syncstats
WHERE org_id = (SELECT id FROM auth_user WHERE username = 'Dalgo Demo') 
  AND sync_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '2 months'
GROUP BY connection_id;
Vanna couldn’t figure out the join between the ddpui_syncstats and ddpui_org tables.
Q3. Can you give me a pivot table of org names against the roles Each cell represents the count of org users in that role for that particular org
WrenAI
Answer
-- Count of verified org users by role.
SELECT
  "o"."name" AS "org_name",
  "r"."name" AS "role_name",
  COUNT("ou"."id") AS "user_count"
FROM
  "public_ddpui_org" AS "o"
  JOIN "public_ddpui_orguser" AS "ou" ON "o"."id" = "ou"."org_id"
  JOIN "public_ddpui_role" AS "r" ON "ou"."new_role_id" = "r"."id"
WHERE
  "ou"."email_verified" = TRUE
GROUP BY
  "o"."name",
  "r"."name"
ORDER BY
  "o"."name",
  "r"."name"
This is the correct answer. It’s able to multiple joins very easily.
Vanna.ai
Answer
SELECT org_id,
       role,
       COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM ddpui_orguser
GROUP BY org_id, role
ORDER BY org_id, role;
This is nowhere close to the correct answer. It looks like training Vanna on just an information schema is not enough, it needs a lot more context to output the correct sql. The context can be in the question or in the training documentation.
Conclusion
I think overall WrenAI has performed better but this is just based on a preliminary analysis. We may be able to increase Vanna’s accuracy by coming up with a better training plan.
WrenAI’s semantic modeling layer is a very novel idea and seems to be working nicely. I really like that the UI gives you the entity relationship diagram of your tables where you can easily go & update the business logic or description or context on any table and relation.Title: The AI for Global Development Sprint: Three Days of Learning, Networking, and AI Musings

==================================================

When Lobo asked me to be part of the organizing team for the AI for Global Development (AI4GD) Sprint, I had exactly zero clue what the Agency Fund was. Tech4Dev is a treasured partner for them, and they fund us too, but somehow this whole side of things had never crossed my radar. So I nodded along, did some frantic Googling, and suddenly found myself in daily calls with Sasha, Sruthi, and Edmund discussing everything from rooming arrangements to booklet design to how many icebreaker sessions we could reasonably get away with.
The sprint week arrived after what felt like an eternity of planning (but also, where did the time go?). I landed at the hotel and met my roommate, Roberta—who, within five seconds of introducing herself, immediately declared, “I’m sorry, I’m a hugger” and wrapped me in a very enthusiastic embrace. Turns out, she is also one of the warmest, most interesting people I’ve met. We spent hours talking about Star Trek (a shared obsession), politics in Brazil vs. India, race and multiculturalism, her research work at the Agency Fund, and somehow, by the second night, she had developed an instinct to wake up mid-sleep to check if I was okay if I made a sound. Just the best kind of person to accidentally get assigned to you as a roommate.
The night before the sprint officially began, the organizing team had our first in-person meeting. I figured I’d be in the background—helping out, making sure things were running smoothly, maybe passing around mics—but the Agency Fund team was so ridiculously inclusive. They genuinely cared about what I thought, actively pulled me into discussions, and by the end of the meeting, I’d somehow been handed the role of emcee. Which, as a former theater kid, I obviously loved.
And then Day One kicked off, and wow.
There were about 90 people in attendance, spanning funders, awardees, and NGOs. The keynotes were next level. The first was by Han Sheng Chia from the Center for Global Development, who presented a research-driven keynote on AI in global development—absolutely fascinating stuff. One study he referenced left me spiraling: A rural electrification project in Kenya was meticulously monitored to see if access to electricity improved outcomes. Spoiler: It didn’t. Why? Because the issue wasn’t just access to electricity—it was that people didn’t have the capital to invest in devices to make use of it. Sure, kids got more time to study at night, but they also got more chores. Just a wild, deeply insightful case study on why surface-level interventions often miss the mark. (Seriously, look up the study, it’s so worth reading – Lee, Kenneth, Edward Miguel, and Catherine Wolfram. Experimental Evidence on the Economics of Rural Electrification.April 2019. )
Then there was the graph.
It shows the difference in learning outcomes when kids were tutored in Go (the board game) by a human teacher vs. an AI tutor. The human tutors, unintentionally biased, ended up fostering an environment where boys excelled while girls lagged behind. But with an unbiased AI tutor? The girls caught up at an insane rate. One simple intervention, and suddenly the gender gap in learning disappeared. I had to fight the very real urge to get teary-eyed in the middle of the room. Again, if you haven’t seen this study, go find it. (And if you were at the sprint and caught me looking suspiciously misty-eyed at the screen, no, you didn’t. Here is the study – Bao, Leo, Difang Huang, and Chen Lin. “Can Artificial Intelligence Improve Gender Equality? Evidence from a Natural Experiment.” October 11, 2024. SSRN.)
The second keynote was by Manu Chopra, the founder of Karya, and honestly, I love hearing people talk when you can tell they’ve built something truly groundbreaking. Karya lets communities build and own their datasets—datasets that companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are dying to get their hands on. And through the Karya Public License, the communities get paid royalties on their data. They’ve scaled this to pay $25/hour, which in many economies in the global south is life-changing. Manu explained how better pay results in better data, which in turn improves AI, which creates better outcomes for the communities themselves. It’s the kind of system that feels so obvious after someone has thought of it—but no one had done it before him. Just brilliant.
The rest of the day had awardee project presentations, including a fun (and frankly adorable) demo by Rocket Learning. We got to see the amazing work done by the seven awardee organizations: Rocket Learning, Jacaranda Health, Noora Health, Reach Digital Health, Digital Green, Precision Development, and Youth Impact. The strides they’ve been able to take in their respective areas were nothing short of inspiring.
Then came the funder panels and closed-door discussions. We had incredible conversations about funding priorities, collaboration, and potential. One thing that stood out: There’s a trillion dollars invested in AI globally, but the social sector has only managed to scrape together a billion. And that gap? It’s staggering. I also brought up something that’s been bothering me for a while—how there’s no centralized knowledge base for AI in the social sector. There are so many orgs working on the exact same problems, but they don’t always know who’s already solved what. The idea seemed to gain traction in the room, and I left hopeful that this could become a real initiative in the future. Maybe I’ll be a part of it.
Days Two and Three leaned more technical, which was my jam. We had sessions on:
– Fine-tuning LLMs for different languages
– Graph RAG
– Evaluating Indic language support in LLMs
– Ethical AI in helpline services
– Evaluation frameworks for chatbots
One of my favorite conversations was with Emmanuel from Jacaranda Health about the near-impossible challenge of fine-tuning an LLM for Sheng—a Swahili-English hybrid that changes every few blocks, evolves absurdly fast, and was literally invented by youth to confuse older people. Yet, somehow, they do want to use it with chatbots. If we crack this, it’ll be an AI milestone.
Another fascinating insight came from Digital Green: Women, compared to men, need way more research and evidence before implementing chatbot-suggested advice. Not because of education gaps, but because their lived experiences make them more skeptical. And because women and men also have different language competencies due to education differences, Digital Green found it necessary to train separate fine-tuned models for each. Several other NGOs in the room nodded in agreement, which really solidified how these behavioral differences impact AI adoption in ways I hadn’t considered before.
USAID cuts came up often, and their impact on the social sector has been devastating. But what stood out to me was the resilience in the room—everyone had this “let’s soldier on” attitude. Instead of despairing, they were actively looking at how AI could help improve efficiency, stretch resources, and ensure they could keep making an impact even with fewer funds. It reminded me of that Fred Rogers quote: “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” This sprint? It felt like I had met those helpers.
On day 2, Sanskriti from ARTPARK and I got into a deep discussion with Arjun Venkatraman from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, who has very interesting contrarian perspectives on the often superfluous use of GenAI in projects where a reliance on good ol’ statistical, rule based systems could lead to much better outcomes, especially when cost is also a factor. Also, my oh my, his life story is such a rich tapestry of insane stories and a reminder of how free will is something we all have but don’t exercise to the extent that he has done. For some of the details on those stories you’re going to have to reach out to him I’m afraid – they’re not mine to divulge. In addition, it was also a joy to behold Lobo in his element, navigating the room with surgical networking precision. I had heard before of his vast, deep rooted knowledge of the sector, but to see it in person left me awed and proud to be working where I was.
And then, of course, there were the icebreakers, which I ran on Days Two and Three. We did “Human Bingo” (a networking game where people bonded over ridiculous shared traits) and “Find Your Match” (cue a room full of people running around trying to figure out who was the ‘Salt’ to their ‘Pepper’ and what ‘Salt’ would do if they were ‘President of the world’ for a day). I was half expecting people to roll their eyes, but everyone got so into it, and by the end, people were appreciative of the exercise for making them interact outside their usual groups. Mission accomplished.
Feedback forms were handed out twice a day, and every evening at 8, the Agency Fund and the Organizing Team (which included me) would meet to adapt the schedule for the next day based on real-time feedback stats. Roberta put together a dashboard that analyzed responses, and seeing that level of flexibility, initiative, and genuine concern for everyone’s experience was amazing. I picked up so many new skills—management, adaptability, event planning—you name it.
When I walked into the sprint, I was still figuring out where I stood in the social sector. By the time I walked out, I had a much deeper understanding of its challenges, its quirks, and just how much more work there is to do. More than anything, though, I felt motivated. Motivated to do more, learn more, and find ways to actually solve some of these problems.
If nothing else, I left deeply caffeinated and more in love with this community than ever.
Until next time, AI4GD. You were a ride.Title: The Bangalore Sprint

==================================================

This Sprint in Bangalore was exclusively a team event unlike the previous ones, where we had the Data Catalyst Program and Glific Sprints running parallely. This gave us a big chunk of our time to discuss on the product and team related items. We had just released the UI for transformations feature for Dalgo and the team was in high spirits. Everyone had worked hard towards our release and was time to pat everyone on the back.
Through the week, we were looking forward to the product discussions, mainly on the new features planned for the quarter, some bit of cross learning/exchange with the Glific teams, discussions around AI. And then there were product reviews with the senior leadership team.
There were interesting discussions on Values with our consultant Arjav. The entire process of arriving to the Tech4Dev values was quite insightful. While it began with diving deep into the feedback received from a select team members, we moved on to analysing our style of working, how we engage with each other internally and with our clients, how we foresee ourselves in the future. These participative discussions led us to our first draft.
We also had our guest speaker on one of the days, Sucheta Bhat, CEO Dream a dream who had a very engaging conversation with our team on equality, success and building technology for the inequalities. Interesting perspectives, but left us pondering over an intriguing question on how technology can bridge the gaps.
Overall a busy week, we still got some time to catch a game of badminton, fun games and some cacophony on the mike with Karaoke 🙂
As the Sprint comes to an end, it leaves with an introspective on what could have been better or thinking how do we excel in our next one. While meetings are required to make progress on our products and fCxO charter, some of the obvious questions that come to us are,
How can we make our Sprints more effective?
What is an optimal timeframe we meet?
Are we making the best use of time together?
Should it be outcome based or open ended?
Should the Sprint be more structured?
I am of the opinion that we need more open calendars during the Sprints. Here is the time when we are together as a team, utilise it best to interact with each other, with open discussions, thinking out of the box, brainstorming on some of the pain points or customer issues leading to something more meaningful and tangible outcomes.
To summarise, need a right mix of setting Sprint goals and keeping time for open discussions.Title: The Critical Role of Account Recovery in Survivor Support

==================================================

By Jakki Bedsoe and Jessica Hubley of AnnieCannons
Survivors of human trafficking cite at least one transformative relationship as one of the most effective strategies for a successful exit from of exploitation. At least one person who believes in them, sees their authentic self, showers them with unconditional love and shows up consistently without judgement makes a huge difference. To work, these relationships must center trust, empowerment and autonomy for the survivor. And they must counter the unhealthy relationship dynamics that exploiters employ to control their victims.
So how does technology solve the problem of helping survivors find transformative relationships? Or better yet, a network of transformative and supportive relationships that help them on their path to safety, stability and a lifetime free from exploitation?
The ReferAll platform answers that question. It does something very unique. While is doesn’t create a human being or transformative relationships, it
does
help survivors who have transformative relationships stay connected to that support throughout the periods of deep disconnect the characterize most trafficking experiences. ReferAll also helps those who do not have transformative relationships make connections with service providers and advocates who can help them meet their needs, access greater safety, and work towards their individual, self-identified goals. These providers may include or be integral to the development of a network of transformational relationships that support the individual survivor. ReferAll facilitates connection when that connection might have otherwise been lost — or never initiated.
In conversation with providers serving survivors of human trafficking, particularly in the Child Welfare System, AnnieCannons has learned how challenging it can be to maintain connections with survivors actively being exploited. While a survivor might enter the system with a cell phone, they can lose access to it due to the rules and expectations of their foster home or group home placement or by actions of the trafficker. If they become disconnected from care and do not have their phone, they can lose important contact information of the members of their support team. Losing their phone can also happen outside of care and survivors often cycle through several devices while experiencing exploitation. The longer a survivor is disconnected from those they have built transformative relationships with, the harder it can be to re-establish trust and access safety and stability through support from members of their team.
One provider we spoke with described how helpless she felt in connecting with a survivor in her care. The survivor was actively experiencing exploitation when they first connected. They exchanged phone numbers during their initial meeting and met a handful of times to develop goals and connect to resources. One day the provider called and did not receive an answer from the survivor. She tried again the next day but no luck. After a few days she tried again to find the phone was no longer in service. She had no other way to contact the survivor, nor did any other members of her team.
She described waiting for months until the survivor showed back up in the Child Welfare System and the two stumbled upon each other once again. The provider learned that the young person had been re-exploited and had not a single number of anyone safe in her phone. She was smart and tried calling organizations and the few numbers she had memorized but no one could connect her back to her team.
The story was heartbreaking. To think that someone who wanted to connect and leave their experience of exploitation was out of reach from the people who could help her do just that. Unfortunately this happened again and over the course of a year, the provider and survivor connected whenever fate finally brought them together again.
On the other hand, providers, including those working directly with survivors in the Child Welfare System, report that the ability to stay consistently connected, often on a weekly basis, help survivors remain stable in their foster care placements, attend school on a regular basis and prevent further experiences of exploitation.
Technology like ReferAll can improve each of the above scenarios. The survivors experiencing material severance from care or contacts can redownload the application onto a new device each time the previous one is lost, recovering all account information, contacts, and history. This obviates the need to memorize providers? numbers. Survivors can connect directly on the platform with providers they’ve consented to be in touch with. Providers can leave messages and updates for the survivor that remind them they are ready and available to reconnect, even if the survivor is AWOL.
Additionally, survivors with technology will be able to do more with ReferAll than maintain connections with their support team. They can also build self efficacy skills in finding resources and additional services that meet their needs and for which they are eligible. They can also store information about themselves, including tasks and goals.
This technology is integral for survivors because ultimately, people are integral to survivors. We know that with the right technology, one that listens to the challenges and barriers preventing a person from achieving their goals and actualizing their autonomy, we can create real change in the lives of our most vulnerable and marginalized populations. This is technology powered by the people it serves.Title: The Evolution of Project Tech4Dev – Reflections and Conversations

==================================================

Headed back home to San Francisco, after another exhausting but satisfying trip to India. This trip was a combination of visits and meetings with our team, NGOs, software partners and our funders. Am both humbled and proud to see our team at work, our collaboration with our software and data partners and more recently the deep relationships we are building with a few foundations across India.
The team and the community have embraced our blogging culture. We already have quite a few blogs from the NGOs and team who attended the
Glific
,
Avni
,
Project Tech4Dev
and
Dalgo
sprints. Also, a bunch of
new case studie
s from the fCxO gathering thanks to a concerted push by Mohd Shamoon, a veteran Tech4Dev engineer (and now leader and only member of the Fractional Tech Team!)
A few highlights and things that we might need a re-think of from this trip, in my preferred listicle format
Visited Tamil Nadu and Chennai for the first time and am always amazed by the diversity, beauty and terrain of the country, along with a small peak into the culture (with an emphasis on food and coffee). Met Merlia from Madhi who graciously spent a few hours with me educating me on both the education system in TN / India and the contribution of TN to the Indian economy. Love the work that her team does in combination with the government to make a systemic impact across the state. Also met Dr. Prahlatan from Bhumi who gave me a good overview of the volunteering sector in India, the challenges that Bhumi tackles and how the volunteering conference (VolCon) which they started has evolved over the years. Gives us a roadmap for how we can structure Tech4Impact (our stab at an NGO Tech Conference in India) going forward. Also spent the weekend in Chennai and loved walking through old Chennai and seeing the hustle and bustle in the city. The central part has not been infected with modern buildings, which is a good thing, IMO 🙂
Shore Temple, a major attraction in Mahabalipuram
At the sprints, my favourite thing is the morning and evening walks and chatting with partners who are on the walk. Get to learn in detail the work they are doing, the way their program operates and the role the individual plays in the organization. In specific I enjoyed learning about e-Vidyaloka from Nitya and their reach of the program using a volunteer teacher model all conducted remotely. Had an interesting discussion with Shivangi and Anita from Goonj on how to manage and influence change in larger NGOs. Along similar lines, a discussion with Jayesh from Lend-a-Hand India on bringing in tech internally and the challenges of building a team to manage complex projects. An interesting discussion with Gautamraj from Reap Benefit on the power of open source and collaboration, but being flexible and focusing on building good solutions for NGOs at an affordable price is what we are aiming for,
The Glific Sprint Group
Always grateful to the ecosystem for being so generous with their time and knowledge. Rajsekhar from Digital Green came down and shared his knowledge with the group about the work DG has been doing in the area of AI/LLMs. More details on how we are approaching the AI platform and the sprint by
Akhilesh and Nishika are
here. It’s kinda cool to kickstart a new project with a set of our peers and build things collaboratively
Erica and I met Bhagwan Thacker from the Empowerment Foundation at the Dasra office in Mumbai along with Apurva (Dasra’s AI Lead). It’s always useful to lay out our plan with a funder primarily because you have to put it in a nice logical manner. Kinda cool to see how the interplay of roles and words we use happens with Erica, Vinod and me since we don’t practice this. It’s gotten a lot better in the past year as we do funder meetings together. At times we also have differing opinions on our approach (or what we’ve done), and talking about that with an external person seems ok. We managed to squeeze in a quick meeting with our board member, Shilpa Kumar in Mumbai as we headed to the airport. Always grateful to Shilpa for asking us the hard questions and also being the person who pushed  Tech4Dev hard to build a team in India (at which point we hired Erica). Earlier this week we met with the team from Fidelity International Foundations, a current funder, where we spoke about our work, our approach and where we are headed. It seemed to resonate with the management team visiting from the UK and I suspect they got a better understanding of why we need to also think about working with the ecosystem and
build for the sector.
In the past couple of years, we’ve worked closely with the A.T.E. Chandra Foundation with their Rejuvenating Water Bodies (RWB) project across our 3 platforms (Avni, Dalgo and Glific). This year, we’ve also started work with the Veddis Foundation in the engagement with different state governments in their Rural Livelihood Mission initiatives. From an operational level, our conversations with their team have exposed us to working with the government, managing their expectations, and at the same time listening and adapting to ground-level realities. They’ve also pushed us and ensured that we deliver a high-quality, reliable product with minimal manual intervention. This has been a bit hard with the probabilistic nature of LLMs, but has helped us (with Jerome White’s amazing guidance) to
build an evaluation system for this case
. Our work with Veddis, Glific and Dalgo is driving the features we are adding to our
upcoming AI Platform
Vinod and I wrapped up our trip with a day-long meeting with Hrishi, Raju and Sreekanth from the Azim Premji Foundation. Hrishi has been an amazing thought partner but at the same time very open with his thoughts and experiences, what might work, and where we can do better. It was cool to see all their experiments with Frappe across their grantees, specifically building specific solutions for their NGOs using a nice low-code abstraction tool via Frappe. We then switched to what they were experimenting with from an AI perspective. There is a significant intersection between their work and our work. Their commitment to continue exploring this space makes them a great collaborator for our AI Platform and we are planning to do stuff together. Our Bangalore team will spend a day with them in the next few weeks and we’ll figure out where and how we can work together. Super excited about the potential for this partnership
Seeing and talking with these foundation partners is encouraging and a great validation of the model and what we are doing. A few years back, it was a different story. I do think that both foundations and evolved, and at the same time, we’ve matured (or so I hope) and have a better lens on where things are and how we can best serve the larger ecosystem. These relationships will grow and thrive, and I’m curious to see the direction in which they evolveTitle: The Fractional CTO Pilot –     by Vinod Rajasekaran

==================================================

A brief update on our recently launched Fractional CTO pilot project with a NGO working in the women and childrens health space, out of Mumbai. As a recap of the last few months, we embarked on the Fractional CTO pilots as part of Tech4Dev 2.0 as we found during Tech4Dev 1.0 that NGOs lacked in-house technical skills and bandwidth to actively monitor, evaluate, iterate, and integrate technology in their programs. We set out to ease this bandwidth constraint and lack of technical skill set by assigning dedicated mid to senior level technology experts as fractional CTOs to our selected cohort of NGO partners.
The CTO would work closely with NGO leadership and help create and implement technology strategies both for improvement of internal organizational processes and external program interventions as per the priorities identified by the NGO.
We are a few weeks into our consulting with the pilot NGO and are working through learning the organizational context and challenges they are facing from a technology and data perspective.
The initial couple of calls with the NGO partner were aimed at understanding their program interventions, organizations internal processes and constraints, current technology and data infrastructure set up. What we found through the conversations and reading the materials that was shared –
Health survey data was being collected by a few hundred field workers across multiple states and visualized for internal and external use.
The evolution of data strategy over time has resulted in numerous challenges including outgrowing of technology infrastructure, significant manual processes for data and information movement across the organization, actual or perceived high cost of licensed visualization tools leading to reduced use of direct user discovery of visualizations.
Numerous opportunities for directly disseminating data to funders, public health systems etc. are now being done manually due to lack of investment in software technology due to actual or perceived high costs of licensing. Also, at the field worker level, visibility to program level metrics and outcome tracking is limited to periodic manual communications from program coordinators.
Our first step from here was to go deeper into understanding user needs and their use cases at the executive and leadership level to place the current technology infrastructure and bolt down a strong problem statement to address through the course of this pilot with needs assessment and strategy planning phases.
Our next step is to not limit ourselves to just the leadership level but to include stakeholders across the whole organization who interact with the data and understand the totality of user needs across the organization to ensure we understand perspectives across the organization and not just at the leadership level.
To address the high cost of visualization tools, we intend to work jointly on a cost benefit analysis to truly determine if it is worthwhile to pursue buying cloud licenses for currently used  visualization products or a migration to open-source/cheaper solutions. We hope at the end of this pilot to help evolve a strategy for the NGO to have a central and organized data hub that could then provide the core for the chosen analytics platform. This should help the organization streamline their current data flows, reduce manual operations and leverage their data for newer opportunities such as real-time program insights for funders, seamless data transfer to public health systems and possible information transfer to served communities.
One key learning on the data ecosystem for non-profits, from our current endeavor, is to constantly re-visit assumptions and current technology infrastructure/data strategies as programs evolve and expand. This reduces the growth of systems to a significant size that systems migration or update becomes extremely cumbersome.
Covid-19 has changed the ways we operate in multiple ways and at the digital level, has contributed to a mushrooming of data collection endeavors that has definitely become easier with the wide proliferation of mobile usage. The (re-)structuring of systems, if prioritized by NGOs, to deal with the amount of data now being collected and analyzed will greatly increase the ability of non-profits to use these insights to help better outcomes and project funding opportunities.
Keep tuned for more updates on how we move forward with trying to resolve these data and infrastructure challenges.Title: The Fractional CxO Program with Vasudha Foundation: Early Days and Quick Wins

==================================================

Overview
This is the first in a multi-part series on Project Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO engagement with Vasudha Foundation. The series is a play-by-play of the CxO engagement that is scheduled to last for nine months and will try not to generalize learnings and solutions. While we detail the engagement, we will also get a view into Vasudha’s mission, how technology is leveraged and the diverse set of challenges they face.
Organization Background
Vasudha Foundation champions innovative approaches that can ensure a sustainable and inclusive future for the planet. Vasudha compiles data across the energy, climate and environment space, leveraging cross-sectoral, data-driven analyses and outreach towards accomplishing its mission.
Vasudha Foundation team at their retreat at Taj Fisherman’s Cove, Chennai
Initial CxO Goals
Prior to the start of the engagement, the Tech4Dev fCxO team conducts interviews with the candidate organization’s leadership to:
Understand the organizations needs and timelines
Assess whether the above is a good fit for the fCxO program
These initial interactions yielded a few insights and resulted in laying out the following focus areas for the fCxO, leaning more towards tech assessments, reviews and capacity building:
Vasudha’s use of technology, aided by a deep look at Vasudha’s programs and an understanding how technology can be leveraged in use cases across the organization
A deep dive into the entire data spectrum of ingestion, cleaning, visualization and publishing
Current vendor engagements with a deeper focus on software development processes
The combined internal and vendor-augmented tech capacity, identifying capacity gaps and supporting capacity building as needed
Note that not all fCxO engagements focus primarily on capability and capacity reviews and enhancements; on the contrary they often have specific tech solution deliverables.
Early Days
An org-wide off-site retreat at the beautiful Taj Fisherman’s Cove in Chennai served up the perfect setting and opportunity to meet and interact with the entire Vasudha team. There’s nothing like meeting in person to gain a better understanding of the organization’s mission, culture, challenges and processes. While I have always enjoyed the flexibility that remote work allows, in-person meetings still seem to cut down the time in building relationships and rapport.
Deep dives with program leads (roughly divided into two verticals: climate and energy) followed the retreat, once everyone was back to their respective home bases and settled in. These deep dives were conducted with a top-down approach and answered the following questions:
What are the mission and goals of the program – I also tried to understand how this aligns with the overall mission of the organization
Who are the people involved and what are the interfaces, if any, with other program teams
What are the kinds of projects involved: current projects, upcoming projects in the near term and future projects
What are processes involved from concept to completion and maintenance of a typical project
What are the challenges specific to the program and its projects
How is technology currently being leveraged and how do you think it can be leveraged going forward
I tried to leave technology-specific questions to the end, knowing that this can often lead to tech solutions rabbit holes and could limit my ability to gain a deeper understanding of the program before jumping into brainstorming.
A few early takeaways from the retreat and subsequent deep dives
Vasudha has grown very quickly from around 20 people to over 60 in less than 2 years. Plans are on to grow to around 100 people in the near future
This growth has resulted in burgeoning activity across all programs while at the same time, there are early signs of hurdles in shared resources, processes and communication
Technology usage is diverse and deep, from data dashboard projects to energy systems modelling; from WordPress sites to portals that estimate solar rooftop capacity using drone-based remote sensing; from collecting and aggregating data from dozens of sources to drafting climate action plans at various tiers of administrative divisions, to name a few
Data management is fairly immature
Utilization of cloud storage on Google Drive is limited due to a perception of low storage limits and a lack of awareness of pooled storage
Data is often stored on personal devices with backups on external drives
Data pipelines are not well-defined and automation is minimal, leading to long timelines and recurring errors
Vendor relationships are generally good, but there is concern about timelines, budgets and capacity
Some projects are stalled due to a variety of reasons, but seemingly from a technology capability gap
Vasudha’s partnerships at all levels of government and private industry are strong and seem to be contributing to a large and diverse set of successful projects
Vasudha Foundation CEO, Srinivas Krishnaswamy and Programme Head, Raman Mehta with Ms Supriya Sahu, Additional Chief Secretary to Government, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Forests, Tamil Nadu and Ms Nirmala Raja, Chairperson, Ramco Community Services
A Couple of Quick Wins
Since data is at the center of all of Vasudha’s interventions, managing that data with appropriate governance policies seemed to be an appropriate endeavor to look at first. Moving to shared, centrally managed storage was a required first step and to this end, we decided to drive the adoption of Google Drive as the cloud storage platform for documents and raw data. Priya from the comms team championed this and quickly removed the fear of running out of storage by signing up for the Google Workspace non-profit plan. 100 TB may not seem like enough for large data organizations, but at Vasudha’s current storage needs, this would be more than enough for a while.
After understanding how people at Vasudha manage their data and documents and control access to them, we created distinct shared drives for each sub-vertical and cross-functional team. Additionally, we bootstrapped each drive with a basic directory structure as a starting point for people to organize their data in a logical hierarchy. Distinct shared drives also gave people the freedom to organize data and manage access in a manner that made sense to their team.
On the renewable energy front, development was completed on the solar cities portal in collaboration with the New and Renewable Energy Development Agency in UP. The portal allows residents to make informed decisions on investing in rooftop solar installations with information on financial benefits through available subsidies, insights into the payback period of the investment and the potential monthly savings on electricity bills. The project leverages drone and satellite imagery to assess rooftop solar potential at a building level using solar radiation and shadow modeling.
Uttar Pradesh Solar Cities Portal
Launch of the solar portal project was on hold pending procurement of the appropriate infrastructure by the government partner. The quotes that they were getting turned out to be far beyond the expected budget for the project. After initial conversations with the program team, the government partner and the vendor, a few questions lent clarity on a viable approach. The following is a simplified version of the investigation to give some insight into our reasoning:
What does the roadmap for this project look like i.e., is there further development planned after the initial launch
Answer: Only two cities have been imaged so far and the plan is to launch 4 cities by the end of 2024 (almost a year away)
What are the expected scale requirements e.g., how many users are expected to use the portal at average and peak loads
Answer: Unknown but we can ballpark peak load to be around 500 users at initial launch
What are the current procurement quotes for in terms of number of cities and number of users
Answer: 8 cities; number of users at peak has not been estimated
Would it be possible to implement a simple scale up strategy and launch with a minimal configuration
The answer to the last question was yes in the end and it was decided to obtain quotes around this plan. The vendor that developed the portal was also requested to put in a quote – the added benefit of reducing the overhead of deploying to a third-party datacenter for each subsequent bug-fix, enhancement or scale up was appealing.
In the end the development vendor turned out to be the best option and came in at about a sixth of the price that was initially quoted. The solar cities portal was successfully launched and is gaining both users and attention.

In the next parts of this series, we will look at a more detailed tech assessment of Vasudha Foundation, ongoing projects, data challenges, software processes, capacity requirements, medium term changes and finally a technology roadmap.Title: The Fractional CxO Program with Vasudha Foundation: Tech Assessment

==================================================

Overview
This is the second in a multi-part series (
part 1
) on Project Tech4Dev’s Fractional CxO engagement with Vasudha Foundation. This post focuses on the org-wide tech assessment that’s often the first deliverable in our engagements.
Why an initial tech assessment is important
We spend a significant amount of time interviewing the NGOs we work with to ensure that tech is one of their top priorities and that they can allocate enough resources to tech interventions that we mutually agree are necessary and high-priority. We then arrive at a proposed approach for the engagement, which includes a plan sequenced in milestones and specific deliverables, that is signed off on by the NGO.
Given this, it would seem like undertaking a tech assessment during the initial phase of the engagement would be superfluous. In most cases, the initial few hours of conversations with (mostly) leadership likely lack the depth required to ensure that our engagements result in long-lasting improvements in tech capacity and capability across the organization. There are  however engagements that are more narrowly focused on specific projects or programs and in those cases we may skip the org-wide tech assessment.
Tech assessment plan
Strategic Alignment
: Are programs, projects, and operations aligned with the organization’s vision, mission, and strategy?
Tech Systems
: Is there a clear tech strategy and roadmap? Are systems integrated, reliable and scalable?
Tech Team Capacity
: Does the team have the necessary skills and capacity to meet current and future needs?
Vendor Performance
: Are vendors providing reliable, cost-effective support?
Data Governance
: Is data managed securely, ensuring privacy and proper usage for decision-making?
Strategic Alignment
Starting at the top of this list is important since tech interventions are less likely to be productive if there’s no strategic alignment. After a month of in-depth conversations and interviews with leaders and individual contributors at Vasudha, it was clear that programs were aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives. There were also clear signals of horizontal and dynamic alignment across programs and projects. However, there were a lot of opportunities for improvement in operational efficiency in cross-team project execution and coordination.
Tech Systems
As with most of the organizations that I’ve worked with so far in this sector, there was no well-documented, overarching tech strategy or roadmap. It’s worth iterating that this is usually not high-priority initially for many organizations we work with no matter how far down the road they are in leveraging technology. For Vasudha, leadership felt that tech decisions are not as grounded in technical expertise and experience as they can be and that this could limit their ability to scale their impact effectively.
As a growing organization (from 20 people to around 70 in less than 2 years) Vasudha has quickly outgrown its start-up like IT infrastructure and asset management processes. Though many organizations manage with BYOD policies, this didn’t seem likely to work well for Vasudha given the broad range of hardware and software systems requirements – from relatively light workloads like policy analysis and writing to compute-heavy ones like energy systems modeling and GIS analysis. Here too, software tooling was mature for these compute-heavy tasks but lacked the same level of maturity for collaboration tools. e.g. though Google Workspace is used across the organization, adoption of Google Drive for document management is minimal at best.
Project management tooling was also virtually non-existent. There were teams that felt the absence of this more than others, in particular, teams that worked across programs were starting to find it difficult to manage, coordinate and communicate deliverables and deadlines. As with many non-profits, where donor reporting is an important requirement, managing project budgets and resources involves a complex set of tasks whose needs can outgrow spreadsheets over time. To this end, there was an effort to build a homegrown project management system.
Tech Team Capacity
Though there’s only one full-time developer, team members across programs leverage technology in their daily work which ranges from visual design and web development to GIS analysis and energy systems modeling. Here, software and hardware tooling is well-provisioned; team capacity however will need to grow to accommodate the increasing number of projects in the pipeline at Vasudha.
Vendor Performance
Vendors are fairly responsive when issues arise. Turnaround time for enhancements, bug fixes and data updates seem to be hindered by a few factors such as:
Suboptimal data architecture and processes – especially in data collection and ingestion
Lots of back-and-forth before requirements (including design choices) are fixed
Lack of technical expertise in-house slowing down decisions such as selection of deployment architecture and infrastructure
Mitigating some of these issues could go a long way in reducing costs and timelines and increasing quality and reliability of tech systems.
Data Governance
Data is central to key objectives and as such is reviewed and leveraged across all programs. However the utility of the data is limited by the fact that it remains undiscoverable across the org and exists in silos managed by each project team.
Priority Areas
Tech strategy and roadmap
Tech team capacity and capability
Operational process maturity
Data governance
Emerging recommendations
At the outset, filling at least two roles appears to be required:
Senior technology management (possibly at the CTO level) to chart an overarching tech strategy and roadmap and with the requisite experience to engage with stakeholders, manage vendors and advise and mentor developers, engineers and other tech workers.
Data engineering to architect, build and maintain data management systems and automate existing manual processes
Whew – that was a long write-up and yet it feels like I didn’t cover a lot of what goes into our tech assessments. If you got this far, buy yourself a nice coffee (or other beverage of choice) – you deserve it!Title: The Indian civic tech + open source + NGOs is exploding

==================================================

Back home in SF from yet another amazing, awesome and all the superlatives you can think of trip to India. My experiences over the past decades and specifically over the past year is very similar to what we went thru at Yahoo! and Web 1.0 25+ years ago! We’ve got a great group of people and organizations, multiple initiatives with different groups of partners, and so many events all happening in the same week that brings the community together
So, how do I start. Being an engineer, let’s start from the very beginning of this trip 🙂 This trip was supposed to be an off-calendar trip for me due to a family gathering. Can’t afford to say no to a family gathering in India, considering how often I go back for work, else they’ll completely disown me. Balancing family and work obligations made this trip quite long, and while exhausted (mentally), I’m glad I did it.
After the family gathering, I flew to Delhi to hang out with the Glific Developers and knock a few big infrastructure items off our list. This included fixing a few issues highlighted by the security audit, optimizing our DB storage (i.e. doing what we tell NGOs in our privacy and data retention policy), planning a major DB upgrade (yes, we want to be on relatively latest versions of our entire stack) and in general hanging out and doing stuff that truly brings me joy. Glad we did it, and will ensure we do this at least twice a year. We got a lot of stuff done, ate some amazing home cooked biryani (thanks @mohdshamoon) and ate a lot of mediocre food for the rest of the trip (definitely my biggest disappointment of the trip, and need to educate our young techies on the great food that we could have had, but did not!). Thanks to our friends and close partner, Dhwani RIS, for opening their office to us for our offsite and feeding us during the day.
We organized a developer meet in Gurgaon, primarily since all of us were headed there for a super successful Code For GovTech Summit (C4GT) in Delhi on Sept 11. This was a culmination event for the C4GT program, where we had 10 interns across our four projects. Thanks to the amazing interns, we had major additions to Glific Backend with Internal Dashboard, Glific Frontend releasing a Mobile App, Dalgo adding lots of new connectors and deploying Prometheus/Grafana for logging and Avni adding improved reporting to its system.
The C4GT mentors taking time off for the conference to offer their best look 🙂
From Delhi, we flew to Bangalore to meet the Dalgo team and also finalize the hiring of two new Fractional CxO’s. We were quite successful and happy to report that we’ll have two new senior tech talent join our team in the next few weeks. Introductions coming soon 🙂 We met with a bunch of ecosystem partners (Sattva, Veddis Foundation, Janagraaha, Ooloi Labs, Goonj, Samanvay Foundation) and had a couple of dinners with the team while getting a fair bit of work done at the hip and happening cafes in Indiranagar (SF cafes seem so boring compared to these cafes!)
The main event in Bangalore was the
Oasis conference
organized by the OASIS alliance, where Project Tech4Dev is a founding member. We were at the event in full force, with presentations from Glific, Avni, and Dalgo. The conference was a great gathering of 400+ people across the social sector, from NGO partners, to software & data partners, from funders to individual contributors. It was a long day with a lot of conversations and reconnects with many people across the sector. The organizers did a terrific job of making the conference open and inclusive to everyone and we came away super impressed.

Some closing thoughts and remarks
Really cool to see how far the Indian tech + open source + social sector ecosystem has evolved
Super proud of the Tech4Dev team to see how much we’ve accomplished in such a short time
Networks are important and crucial for the sector to grow
Technology is never the solution, it is just an enabler – We need to make sure people understand this and use the power of the network to figure out the solution
So grateful to see the community post Covid in such beautiful spaces
Opening up our work to folks thinking of joining us is a good recruiting tool. We gave our two new hires an immersive experience, to help them decide if they wanted to be part of it. We think it exposed them to reality and the problems they will have to tackle if they so choose to
Looking forward to the next trip and the sprint in Kochi (Oct 15 – 20)Title: The LLM Transformation Journey

Thinking of a word which shall describe my feeling at the recently concluded AI4GlobalDev sprint organized by
The Agency Fund (TAF)
and
Project Tech4Dev
.
Um, Ah… Awesome, Fabulous, Mesmerizing. Yup, that’s close. Wait a sec. “Transformative” seems to be most apt word and here’s why
Every transformation starts with an experiment. The social sector has multiple interconnected challenges which cannot always be solved by existing solutions. In this sprint, we got a closer look at a beautiful designed experiment engine for the social sector. Yes you heard me right. It gives us the ability to design, execute and analyze the experiment based on a specific problem before you develop your AI powered super solution.
LLMs are so powerful that they can democratize the world wherein each and every person benefits from them or it divides the world and gives unequal benefits based on high or low resource language. Discussions and presentations revolved around practices of fine tuning of AI models using PeFT (Parameter Efficient Tuning). This involves training only on a small subset of parameters instead of the entire model. Specific case studies of fine tuning of Whisper using LoRA for low resource language was very much insightful.
It is such an important decision to select the right model and cannot be underscored. This was highlighted through demonstration of a case study in the education sector. The AI chatbot powered by GraphRAG provides feedback to students based on tasks s/he performs. In this case GraphRAG clearly has more advantages than traditional RAG in terms of handling complex questions and better accuracy because of context. And maybe LightRAG may be the next candidate?
Once chatbots are developed on chosen LLM, it is important to have a framework to evaluate the chatbot. We got a insightful journey of evaluating a chatbot starting with Application evaluation which tests latency, scalability, error handling capacities to AI evaluation which tests questions and answers generation to User testing which evaluates how well user understands, applies and benefits from the chatbot
Well, you have built LLM apps, we have a good evaluation framework, but do we have the confidence that our apps will work as expected. We have lots of combinations to test for. GPT models, text to speech models, markdowns and more. That’s where we were introduced to the world of prompt automation. Manual approach is limited and inconsistent.
What’s the fun of a sprint if the brains are not put to work. A well organized and guided approach was taken to make us evaluate our LLMs. The framework started with evaluating chatbot performance to user engagement to pragmatic RCTs. This is evaluating LLM for its correct response to whether it leads the user to make an informed choice/meets his/her needs.
The sprint couldn’t have been lively without the lovely ice breakers. They got us talking with each other with the context of the sprint and in the spirit of the sprint!!!Title: The evolution of Tech4Dev
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/the-evolution-of-tech4dev/
==================================================

The Tech4Dev group met in Bangalore on April 15 and 16, 2019. A number of the discussions focussed on specific projects which the software companies being represented in the room had worked on for NGOs, or on technologies which had either been deployed or had future potential. There were also some discussions on the future direction that the group wanted to take, in terms of mission, governance, processes, etc.
It was useful to observe the changes from when the Tech4Dev group had met last. It reinforced that the group was evolving rapidly, and that fundamental aspects of this evolution were likely to go by unnoticed unless attention was drawn to them. This blog post is an attempt to do that.
Tech4Dev began as an experiment ? was it possible to have a group of software companies build an understanding of the development sector and develop solutions to scale up the programs of NGOs? Would the solutions be effective, and would this be a viable line of business for the software companies? During the first months, Tech4Dev was a small group of 3 software companies, and a few funders, working with 9 NGOs. While the vision of Tech4Dev was clear, this period also saw experimentation on multiple aspects ? the application process, selection criteria for NGOs, interactions between group members, etc. While the governance of the group was ad-hoc, and interactions informal, there was the immense benefit of group members having strong ties with one another and a high level of trust. The fact that a founding principle of the group was the development of free and open source software meant that transparency as a value was imbibed by all group members.
We are now at the next phase of the journey of Tech4Dev, with the addition of more software partners and NGOs, and a more formal application process. The group has gained experience over the past few months and is now better able to anticipate the needs of NGOs. It is also beginning to contribute solutions back to the open source community. There is clearly a strong demand for the services being provided through Tech4Dev and greater expectations from NGOs in terms of the scale and complexity of the problems to solve. This has led to the group giving more consideration to governance, e.g., the selection process for NGOs as well as the software partners who will work with them. The nature of the group is still informal, and even though some of the members have met for the first time, there are enough pointers to the group being able to carry on operating informally yet effectively, once some procedures for governance have been put in place.
Tech4Dev is likely to enter the next phase of its growth within the next 6 months, one which will see a further increase in the number and size of NGOs, software partners and funders. There are likely to be greater expectations, for technology solutions that help programs achieve even larger scale, and in the group taking a visible leadership role in contributing to and promoting open source solutions. Tech4Dev will need to focus on strengthening itself to meet the challenges of scale. Most importantly, it will need to maintain a high level of trust among the software partners who collaborate but also compete with one another to work with NGOs. This will require a strong commitment to openness and transparency on the part of all the members of Tech4Dev. Simultaneously, a more robust system of governance, including an advisory board, would help steer the group through this phase.
Tech4Dev has immense potential to transform how technology is used in the social sector. As the group takes on the responsibility of making technology more accessible, applicable and affordable, it must invest effort in managing its own growth so that it can effectively serve the social sector while retaining a unique culture of openness and transparency.Title: The year that was 2024: Dalgo reflections

==================================================

As we come to the culmination of the year 2024, we reflect upon the incredible ride Dalgo has made in simplifying data management and empowering our NGO partners to drive meaningful impact. It’s been a year of impactful collaborations and we’re excited to share the highlights with you.
Empowering NGOs: A Growing Community
This year, Dalgo partnered with 11 new NGOs, bringing our total to
15 organisations
using our platform to streamline their data processes. We signed SHOFCO, our first NGO in the African continent this year and it has given us visibility into the regional nuances.
From managing water quality and conservation initiatives to improving educational outcomes, Dalgo has been instrumental in enabling data-driven decision-making for our partner NGOs.
Key Milestones in 2024
Feature Enhancements:
We added several new features to the platform aligning with our
Product Roadmap
, published earlier this year. Below is a quick summary,
Advanced Analytics
AI Data Analysi
s – This feature allows you to leverage AI and write prompts for the  data that’s stored in your warehouse. Explore a range of possibilities; generate quick insights on your data, learn more about the data quality of your dataset, or even summarise qualitative data!
Data Insights
– generates quick statistics on the columns of your tables – minima, maxima, most common values, and null counts to name a few
Data Quality and Governance:
Role-based access contro
ls It allows you to add different users to the platform and assign them a role that grants the added user relevant ‘view’ or ‘update’ permissions
Data Quality with Elementary
– we have integrated this popular data quality tool to summarize your dbt test coverage
Usability
UI for Data Transformations:
We launched a low-code, user-friendly interface for data transformations, making it even easier for organizations to process their data efficiently.
Operational Management
Settings Panel
– Configure the platform settings for User Management, AI etc. We also show details of your Dalgo subscription and the versions of our underlying components
Notifications System
Communicate important news and updates to the clients
Superset Usage Dashboards
This dashboard gives you an overview of how well the visualizations have been adopted by the users in your organization. Insights drawn from here can be used to optimize dashboard utilization and decision making throughout your organization
LLM log summarization
When pipelines fail, we summarize the logs generated by the underlying tools into a human readable summary
Qualitative Analysis
Operations
We  performed a major upgrade to our underlying ETL tool Airbyte – “Destinations v2”. This came with a very useful feature for automatic normalization from JSON to column data, which otherwise was done via SQL in our clients’ dbt pipelines
We upgraded our infrastructure as our clients grew and their sync needs increased, and encountered a few hiccups along the way. These upgrades have sufficed for now but looking forward we are moving Airbyte to Kubernetes as they recommend
We are also running up to four instances of Superset on a host to rationalize costs
Processed over 2.7 billion (not necessarily distinct!) data records across various projects since January 2024. After removing a couple of outlier months, we ingest around 153 million records every month.
Consulting
Consulting work has kept us busy, serving NGOs like
ATECF, Arghyam, SHOFCO, STiR Education, SHRI, Arogya World
. Our engagements with our clients has helped us build deeper understanding on managing data pipelines for them, the nuances and challenges resulting into product/platform feedback. There is that excitement of seeing the data transform into dashboards for the NGOs which helps them into correlating their program performances to organizational goals. We have often seen the requirements evolve as we make progress as the data transformation and visualization leads them to think more on their org needs. We have so far this year spent in  1000+ hours of consulting, which does not include the proof of concepts
Business Development
We introduced free 10 hour proofs-of-concept for Dalgo, a great value proposition to our prospective clients. This has helped us do a quick turnaround of showcasing the platform capability and in helping our clients like
SHOFCO, Ummeed
in decision making to go with the platform. We did a PoC drive in Bangalore and Mumbai locations.
We have been conducting monthly webinars on various topics relating to Dalgo including case studies, new feature releases etc. This has helped us build awareness for the product and increase outreach. We have been seeing increasing interest in the product through these sessions.
We continue to do the outreach on the social media platforms like linkedin and have seen growth in our followers
We also presented Dalgo sessions for
4th Wheel, Ashoka ASPiRE
Ecosystem
We strongly believe in contributing to the ecosystem be it the Open Source community or the Social sector initiatives. This year in addition to the culmination of the DCP Cohort 1 early in January, we initiated our second cohort in August along with Dasra and Goalkeep, in a mission to amplify the impact of data-driven decision-making in the nonprofit sector. Altogether we engaged with  22 NGOs through this program in 2024.
We continue to contribute to the Airbyte platforms in terms of the connectors we build for the NGOS.
We did presentations on Dalgo in the FOSS and PyCon Conferences this year. Here is the link to the video of the presentation at FOSS
How Dalgo automates data insights and helps nonprofits learn better from their data.
We continue to hire interns through the C4GT program. We developed the Notification Systems through this internship and was a significant value add to the platform.
Team
The team met several times throughout the year for the Tech4Dev as well as the Dalgo Sprints in Bangalore. These sprint meetups have not only accelerated the platform or consulting work but also helped us build camaraderie within the team.
In 2024, Himanshu Dube and Pratiksha Rao joined us in our engineering and consulting teams respectively. They have ramped up well and have been contributing effectively to our product goals. They have captured their experiences in the blogs below,
Himanshu’s first sprint in Bangalore
Pratiksha’s Shillong Sprint stories
Poorva, too joined us as a volunteer to work with us on our Kubernetes mission
July NGO Meet – Kanika from ATECF presenting the Dalgo experience with the participants
Success Stories
Our engagement with ATECF has been a long standing one and an excellent example of co-working with AVNI and Glific teams to deliver enhanced customer experience for the Water body Rejuvenation project
ATE Chandra Foundation’s Waterbody Rejuvenation Project
The first AI feature that we developed for the platform was for the use case shared by STiR Education and we closely worked with their team in building the prototype for the Qualitative Data Analysis feature. This further evolved as AI Analysis using Dalgo with support for both Qualitative and Quantitative data analysis.
https://projecttech4dev.org/qualitative-data-meet-dalgo/
Our support team has been doing a fabulous job and has been lauded several times by our clients for quick turnaround times.
We have partnered with our ecosystem partners, Goalkeep and Dhwani RIS in successfully onboarding 2 new NGOs each on Dalgo.
What we learned in 2024
As we work with more and more organizations, our understanding of the ecosystem has gotten better through the data lens. This has led us into evolving our product as well as processes further. The key learnings being,
Simplified Data Access
: Democratizing access to critical insights across all levels of an organization from field level workers to leadership and how we can do this effectively through our onboarding process.
Process Improvisation
: As we understand our clients better, we continue to take feedback from the engagements and reflect upon them to strengthen our consulting and engineering processes
Platform Scalability
– As we add new clients to the platform, ensure platform scalability and hence user experience.
Longish Sales cycles
– Our Sales cycles have been very long and often dependent on the NGO’s priorities. How do we address this key issue in the upcoming year?
Road Ahead: plan for 2025
As we step into the year 2025, we plan to join hands with our partners to deep dive into their areas of expertise and identify solutions to their use cases that will help equip them better in their data driven journeys. Some of the feature experiments we plan to run with our NGOs are with the below themes,
Chat with your Data
converse with your data in plain text English
Storytelling using Data
Leverage the data, dashboards and other collective information to tell your impact story
Simplified Data modelling
Simplify data modeling and reduce the time taken for onboarding
We will continue to strive for operational excellence and ease of use, as we progress in the coming year.
And we plan to jointly work with the NGOs during our Jan 2025 Sprint in understanding their needs and co-developing features for them through the quarter. We continue to engage with our ecosystem partners as well to take our mission forward.. We are truly excited!
A Heartfelt Thank You
None of this would be possible without the trust and collaboration of our clients, the dedication of the Dalgo team, support from our leaders and the feedback from our partners. Together, we’re making data more
accessible, actionable, and impactful for the organizations driving social change.
Here’s to another year of growth, impact, and transforming data into actionable insights!!

==================================================

Am back at home in San Francisco, celebrating Thanksgiving with friends and family, and reflecting on the time we spent as a group in Tehri last week as I slowly come back to the normal routine of everyday life 🙂 I’ve been part of quite a few sprints and events in the past few years, and this event felt like coming round the circle, and things just fell into place quite nicely in a seamless way.
Before I really dive into some of the highlights from my view, I’d like to give kudos to Tushar and Prateek from
Colored Cow
for hosting us in their wonderful office in Tehri and managing all the logistics – accommodation, food, drinks, travel and the epic outdoor party by the lake. Its a lot of work to take care and manage 23 people from the outside world, but they did it with class and style. Our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to them and to all the team members at Colored Cow who helped make this happen. As a reward, we promised them, we’ll repeat this event a couple of times a year, till they get tired of hosting us 🙂
Tehri in short was a perfect spot to host the sprint. It is in a beautiful location with a big lake surrounded by high mountains, close access to nature (i.e. you can walk on the roads with minimal traffic), and less distractions. Since we relied on the trusty Innova to shuttle us, all we could do was: Eat, Drink, Work, Exercise, and Chat. Repeat the same thing for all the days of the week. There were not many things to distract us from the above routine and it gave all of us a chance to unwind, learn more about each other and just have a peaceful time.
The group has documented their experiences in a
series of blog posts
, so I won’t spend any time talking about specifics. Just some random thoughts and impressions from the trip
Having minimal structure at the event was really helpful. A talk at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day. That gave people the freedom and flexibility to structure their day based on their work load. This enabled folks to have more in-depth conversations with folks whose work they were interested in.
It was great to see how involved and participatory the talks were. The talks were optional, but all talks had pretty much 100% attendance, but more importantly, the discussions during and after the talks showed that folks were interested and paying attention 🙂
We were in an amazing location. Super happy to see that people took advantage of the location to go for early morning walks and runs, meditate by the lake and more. On our all day trek, everyone came and pushed themselves to reach the promised cafe,
Auli Chai Cafe
, who ran out of food after serving our ravenous group.
Riding on a motorbike with Akhilesh made his day (not sure why!) and mine. Gotta start pursuing my dream of learning to ride and purchasing my own motorcycle 🙂
First steps towards getting my own bike 🙂
And finally from the team at Colored Cow when reflecting on the event:
Among the other visible outcomes of the event, the economic and cultural impact that the sprint has had in and around the Tehri hills of Uttrakhand has been pretty significant in its own way. When we did this sprint, we brought people from across the globe to this small hill town. It will go a long way in making people believe more in the concept of clean and sustainable tourism.
What’s next?
The Tech4Dev product teams will continue to meet semi-annually. From our perspective, it makes sense to invite other non-profits and software organizations to come together and share ideas and experiences. We’ll announce the dates soon. The location will remain the same :), don’t mess with a good thing!
We need to figure out how to incorporate other aspects of the non-profit world in our talks and interactions and plan on bringing together a diverse set of people the next time around. It is important for tech folks in the sector to see the larger picture and how NGOs are making a difference and impact in society.
One of the things we’ve been aware of is the significant imbalance in the gender ratio within the social sector tech space. We are starting an initiative with the team at Colored Cow to address this imbalance in the hills via a paid internship program for women pursuing their technical degree in the adjoining college. More details on this as we make progress.
As a side-note, for future reference the total cost of running the event was $7,800. This comes down to approx $43 / person / day everything included. The ColoredCow team spent approximately 100 hours in organizing the event. You can see specific details in
the spreadsheet here
. We maintained a separate sheet to maintain participant information and logistics (Not made public due to personal information)

==================================================

The past couple of weeks have been a wee bit disappointing and depressing from a Glific and open source funding perspective. At Tech4Dev, Glific and Chintu Gudiya Foundation, we sit at the intersection of open source and platforms, funder and fundee, NGOs and social businesses. This has both its good sides and the not-so-good sides, and this is my attempt to write down, review and reflect on some of what we’ve been through.
To begin with, Sean at
FrontlineSMS
has started writing a series of blogs on closing FrontlineSMS. Frontline started at approx the same time as
CiviCRM
and its been good to see both projects grow and seemingly prosper. The news of it shutting down hit me a lot harder than I expected, primarily because Glific and Tech4Dev are in the same problem space, and we all want to fight and win the good fight.
He’s published two so far:
Frontline is Closing
, and
Frontline Business
and his words truly do resonate with me, primarily because the path that groups like Frontline,
CiviCRM
,
Avni
,
Glific
and others are so similar and it is incredibly sad when you see an organization like them that is doing really good work close down. To a large extent, all of us in the social sector space, need to figure out how we can help sustain these organizations and ensure they thrive. I do think it is super important that the funding community realize the importance and impact of this, and help with building and supporting the ecosystem. We’ve come a long way in the past decade, but we have many more miles to go …
In the recent past, Glific has advanced to the latter stages in a few funding rounds with 3 different funders, but we did not make it into their final list of selected projects. We did spend a fair bit of time on the applications and interviews, which in turn did help us a fair bit internally on clarifying and documenting some of our thoughts, especially in the areas of
finance, sustainability
,
product roadmap
, and
marketing/branding
. I’ll borrow a few quotes from Sean (in italics) which closely matches what we encountered in some of the above interviews and our current thinking,.
its become increasingly obvious that there arent adequate support infrastructures for public interest technology and, candidly, there never have been
Our intention – for ourselves and our clients – was to increase impact by simplifying things to their core elements
.
our goal was for our tools to be cheap, but the trade-off was that our time was expensive. For a lot of clients, that caused understandable whiplash – and it meant that we were selling project consulting to people expecting a software platform.
Here are a few things, which I think can (and probably should) be improved.
I’m happy with the open and frank conversations we had with the above programs. I also do hope that entities realize the importance of platforms, public interest technology and the importance of free and open source software.
Its super difficult to hear and absorb statements similar to: W
e don’t think we can add any value to your organization
or
We feel you are better positioned to partner with us
. IMHO, Funders bring two main things to the table: financial capital and their networks, and both are equally important and can help organizations at multiple levels. Building networks is a long slow process, we will get there at some point, but would be great to have some assistance
Finally, I would encourage funders to think about the amount of time and energy they expect organizations to spend in interviews and applications.
Overall, I’m glad we are doing this. The team is getting a broader exposure and growing. They also are getting used to the highs and lows of trying to raise money, which will serve us well in the long run.Title: Three new Software Partners join the Tech4Dev Collaborative

==================================================

At Tech4Dev we’ve started working on the
Development Data Platform
(DDP). In short, this allows an NGO to aggregate data from multiple data sources into a unified data warehouse. The data here can be analyzed and visualized directly via the platform. Visually, this looks like:
If you want more details on the above, more information is available in the following documents
DDP Concept Note
DDP Primer
We’ve been working with two of India’s leading NGOs on a Proof of Concept of the above scheme and are quite pleased with the results so far. We’d like to add another 3-5 NGOs to help us validate our platform and add new features that are useful across the sector.
Key requirements for the NGO
You have a mature and robust data collection process
You have a good sense of your data and the information you’d like to glean from it
Your data helps influence and guide your interventions in the future. i.e. your data is useful from a programmatic and/or research perspective
You need the ability to house all your data in one unified place
What does the NGO get in return?
Pro-bono support and assistance in getting started with DDP
Once deployed, you will have a robust data pipeline
Assistance in building good visualizations for your program
Hand-holding and support, every step of the way 🙂
Our love and gratitude forever 🙂
Our expectations
You will have one person who had a good understanding of the needs and will be the main point of contact (PoC) for your NGO
Your NGO will be responsible for the operational and monthly hosting costs. We expect this to be around INR 15K ($200)
The PoC will meet with the DDP team twice a week
Our goal is to wrap up the pilots three months from start

==================================================

By Tejas Mahajan
“Smart does not mean useful”
I am going to use this line more with the folks who reach out or figuring out AI enabled chatbot solutions. Yes, AI is getting smarter at performing calculations, coding, and reasoning. But its usefulness in the real world, to aid/ assist/ improve the lives of teachers, frontline workers, students still needs to be carefully designed and iterated on.
The obvious: AI is a great enabler, provides a wide range of ideas and ways to achieve them.
The nuance: but unlike a great mentor / guide persona, AI may not be able to categorize an idea as “bad” or a “time-sink” or “not-worth-the-effort” in the real world, and get the mentee to re-think a bad idea or outright call out a bad idea for what it is. It is likely to encourage most ideas. AI providers have done well for AI to filter out outright malicious, harmful or destructive ideas. But the real intelligence of a guide is in directing or nudging someone towards a better idea, towards a more refined, which comes from lived experience in most cases, and cannot be simply prompt-engineered.
This is a learning from a research study shared by
Hang Shen Chia
from Center For Global Development (shared by CEGA) which used AI mentor for small business entrepreneurs. In the study it was observed that the entrepreneurs who were otherwise doing better, increased their performance with the use of AI, who were considered lower performance entrepreneurs did a bit worse. The results were attributed to the tendency of AI to continue to encourage bad ideas equally.
Framework for impact evaluation
I have previously written about the what to measure as one designs a program/ pilots a product. You can read it
here
. This essentially captures what broad headers of data to capture (at let’s say 50,000 ft) to track the outputs of the program/ product. During the course of this sprint, I was introduced to framework for evaluating AI enabled programs / products. This I think can be extrapolated quite well to non-AI products as well
It shares the idea that orgs can start with
Model evaluation
, is the level 1 on this framework and the idea here is to check if the model is fit for the task, that it sticks to the role, and is technically accurate or provides useful information for the given purpose. A testing framework to evaluate on how it can be done is shared in a later section.
Product evaluation
, is the level 2 in the framework and the aim is to determine if the product is being used as intended. This step easily applies (in my opinion) to non-AI tech or non-tech product. This needs to answer how well the product engages users, and whether it solves a meaningful problem for the user. It is unlikely that a product will shift development outcomes if it fails to engage its users.
User evaluation
, is the level 3 in the framework and the aim is to determine if using the product positively influence users’ thoughts, feelings, and actions?
Impact evaluation
, is the level 4, an Independent impact evaluation of development outcomes: Is the tech / AI product a cost-effective way to improve development outcomes? Even if levels 1–3 show that the technology functions well, users are engaged, and data suggests improved knowledge or behaviors, organizations deploying tech for social good ultimately care whether their solutions improve users’ health, income, well-being, or other development outcomes. To assess this causal impact, evaluators must estimate the counterfactual- what would have happened to these key outcomes without the intervention.

AI evaluation cook-book
At the highest level, AI evaluation comprises of:
Golden set of Questions and Answers: This is the set of questions which the users are most likely to ask, or have asked in the past. This should be as close to user generated as possible. And corresponding to these questions must be the most accurate (in format, tone and content) answers that are expected. These questions should ideally cover a range of topics and categories, ex- knowledge based, implementation based, personalization based or stress-test (ex- questions that are not be answered by the AI, out of topic or random inputs)
Golden should be golden, it has to be the most correct response expected from the AI, and the golden set of questions and answers should be slowly increased as the user interactions increase.
Then comes the knowledge base (if RAG enabled) plus the system prompt, which is being provided to the LLM to generate the answers.
Run a evaluation pipeline to determine how close the AI generated answers are to the human generated answers. Two simple metrics that can be run to get a deterministic metric of how well the LLM is performing as compared to the golden answers are:
Cosine similarity:
gives an indication of how similar is the LLM generated answer as compared to golden answer for the given question.
Context precision:
gives an indication of how close the chunks of information retrieved from knowledge base is as compared to the questions
Determining a threshold value for these metrics, and then tweaking the prompt and knowledge base (if needed) to increase these, along with increasing the golden set of questions and answers is the iterative process to determine
The above is a high level description of what needs to be implemented for a text based input and output for a RAG enabled solution. For more information on specific to your usecase, and deeper use cases such as voice to voice interactions, consider reaching out to Edmund Korely (
edmund@agency.fund
) for the tech part or myself (
tejas@projecttech4dev.org
) for help in thinking through what kind of AI evaluation can be applied specific to your org’s use case.
Attention: What is your cost per unit outcome
One must be start getting super articulate on the “output” and “outcomes” of the program, how are these being measured. What are the checks for unbiased analysis.  As per the common consensus
randomized evaluations
offer the most credible way to measure this, clearly attributing changes in outcomes to the intervention.
If a nonprofit is able to demonstrate the outcomes achieved, the delta (change in outcomes attributed to a certain intervention), and in parallel go on to measure the cost per unit outcome. (it may sound absurd, but that is the mathematical and analytical modeling required). Without doing these, we risk overinvestment in products that
feel
good, at the expense of investing those resources in products that actually
do
good
For example, the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, piloted
Letrus
, an AI platform providing personalized essay feedback to students, alongside a randomized evaluation. The
evaluation
found that students using Letrus wrote more essays, received higher-quality feedback, engaged more individually with teachers, and scored higher on national writing tests than those who did not. Given these results, Espírito Santo expanded Letrus statewide, and the platform is now active in
six additional Brazilian states.
Being able to demonstrate an intervention or a solution which shows the outcomes at reduced cost is when there is a chance at getting the attention of the government stakeholders, policymakers to collaborate with you, for funders to listen and join in your amazing work.

==================================================

This month all-hands meeting was quite special for me. I received several mentions and was praised for my work, which felt really nice. Specifically, I was recognized for my contributions to the Janaagraha project and my efforts in optimizing the CI pipeline. However, I couldn’t help but feel a bit surprised by the attention. In my view, I was just solving problems that seemed obvious to address.
For instance, I was frustrated with the CI checks taking 70 minutes to complete, delaying my PRs. It didn’t make sense to me since everything ran smoothly on my local machine. Given that the CI machines should be even faster, I spoke to Rohit and proposed an optimization to speed up the checks.
Similarly, with the Janaagraha project, I simply pointed out areas that could be improved and shared those insights with the team. I believe anyone assigned to that role would have done the same.
But this recognition made me realize that it’s the culture we have in Tech4dev that enables me to make these contributions. We have the autonomy to raise issues when something could be improved and the freedom to voice our opinions across different areas. We’re encouraged to innovate and experiment, even outside our core responsibilities.
Before I dive deeper into my experience with Janaagraha, let me share a brief history of my journey at Tech4Dev.
For those unfamiliar, Tech4Dev focuses on three main initiatives, and I’ve had the chance to contribute to all of them. There are also collaborations with partner organizations where I’ve gained valuable lessons.
The main initiatives include two products
Glific
and
Dalgo
and the
Fractional FCXO program
. Until March, I spent three years working on Glific. It’s been a rewarding journey, watching the product grow from an idea developed with a few NGOs to a fully-fledged operation with a dedicated team for sales, support, marketing, product development, and consulting.
This year, I felt the need for a new challenge. I wanted to transition into a role that would allow me to work more closely with an FCXO, focusing on strategic tech decisions and gaining a deeper understanding of both the tech and business aspects within an organization.
However, circumstances led me to join the Dalgo team, which turned out to be a fantastic experience. I gained substantial knowledge in data, server security, remote machines, DevOps, and data visualizations, while also completing two POC consulting projects.
Finally, the time is coming for me to transition into the Fractional FCXO team, where we’re exploring a new model. The idea is for the fractional FCXO to focus on higher-level strategic decisions while a fractional tech and data expert handles the implementation, closely collaborating with the team.
And that brings me to
my journey with Janaagraha

==================================================

We have completed the work on the Inventory Management System for Toybank. It has been deployed and the project handover process has been completed.
Here is a summary of the project.
Toybank, an initiative under The Opentree Foundation is an organization in India that promotes the Right to Play for all children. It provides a platform for all individuals from all ages to participate in this movement of propagating the Right to Childhood.
We have implemented the Inventory Management System for Toybank, using an Open Source CMS Drupal.
Here are the key features:
User Management
This module enables admins (Super Admins and Data Entry Admins) to control user access and onboard and offboard Inventory Teams, Program Officers and Welfare Managers.
Play Center Management
This module lists the Play Centers and it allows you to manage the play center by its classification. The list also shows the no of kids at the Play Center, play center status and the type of the center along with its partner details. The list of Play Centers can be downloaded as a CSV file.
Game Management
This module allows the Inventory Team to check/review the verified games at the Warehouse. The Games are verified by the Welfare Managers.
These games are classified into Strategy, Puzzle, Block, Alphabetical and General category, which is commonly known as SPBANG.
Inventory Workflows
Inventory Workflow module keeps track of the number/quantity of games being added or sent to Playcenter.
Request Generation
This is the most complex and critical part of the system and the entire system is dependent on this flow. Here the Program Officers and Welfare Managers generate a Game request on behalf of the Play Center.
The Game request is dependent on the shortfall inventory at the Play Center and divided into the SPBANG category.
Stock Auditing
This module enables the inventory auditing ability on the available games at two places, one is for the Inventory Team at the Inventory Warehouse and the second is for the Program Officers at the Play Centers. Welfare managers have access to both places. The auditing could be done on-demand or monthly, quarterly and yearly as per the need.
Report Generation
Reports in this system give you the ability to view the available inventory at Warehouse or Play centers from month to month or on-demand. Report data can be viewed online or downloaded as a CSV file.
Available Reports
Full Stock Report – How much stock is available based on types in the Warehouse Inventory
Classification of games based on the categories, age groups, condition of the games at the Warehouse and Play Center Inventory
List of Play Centers based on game categories
Monthly or on-demand games stock report at the Play Center
Game request sheet report of the Play Center
The game audit report for Warehouse and Play Center Inventory
Play sessions activity report on-demand, monthly/yearly for a specific program officer
Record Activities
This module allows Program Officers to record activities conducted during the play sessions at the Play Center.
Further, these Paly sessions are also accessible to Welfare managers and they can monitor the same.

As a part of the Tech4Dev initiative, we are working on a project for
Toybank
.
Introduction
Toybank, an initiative under The Opentree Foundation is an organization in India that promotes the Right to Play for all children. It provides a platform for all individuals of all ages to participate in this movement of propagating the Right to Childhood.
Toybank reaches toys and board games to underprivileged children through distributions and the setting up of toy libraries called Play Centers.
Toybank believes in the philosophy ? “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.?
Toybank Founded in August 2004. As of March 2018, Toybank has set up 285 Play Centers and impacts the lives of 43,919 at-risk children every day.
Mission- To address developmental needs in children through games, toys, and play.
They are in the process of mapping the Game and Behavioural problems & have developed programs and initiatives particularly focusing on,
Tracking behavioral problem
Mental growth of children
Current Process
Toybank regularly organizes collection drives in schools, corporate houses, etc. through its volunteer network. And keeps track of these toys manually at each warehouse. Then these toys are then dispatched to its play centers or wrapped and set aside for distribution. The inventory dispatch sheet is also issued manually by the admin staff.
Toybank program officers/ field officers conduct these programs.
They also conduct training for NGO partners and other school teachers who teach at the play centers.
Project Details
After our initial engagement with Toybank, at their office in Mumbai, we identified that there were a lot of areas needing technology support, which could bring in a significant change in their day to day work. Those areas are,
Inventory Management
Play Session Management
Tracking of Volunteers
Center Management
Delivery Management
Program Delivery Management
Donor Management
Document Repository
We also visited their Warehouse and Play Center in Mumbai to understand the requirements in detail.
After discussion with the Toybank team and based on the requirements it was decided to work on their inventory management & play session management work.
The project has been divided into 2 phases.
Phase 1
Inventory Management
Ability to manage Toys inventory
Ability to issue toys to Play Centers
Ability to track the status of the toy at the warehouse
Ability to track the status of the toy at Play Centers
Implement access control
Reporting
Inventory
Play center
Phase 2
Play Session Management
Technology Solution
We have evaluated Odoo an open source all in one management software:
https://www.odoo.com/
. and after analyzing the requirement we think the Odoo warehouse management component might be a good fit for this project.
As a part of the Tech4Dev initiative, Phase 1 will be implemented. The development of the project has started in the last week of June.
Any suggestions and feedback are most welcomed.Title: Tracking Data Changes Like a Pro – Meet DBT Snapshots!
Author: Pratiksha Rao
Date: January 2025
Category: Dalgo
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/tracking-data-changes-like-a-pro-meet-dbt-snapshots/
==================================================

When Data Chaos Strikes
Picture this: You’re running an NGO, collecting data from various sources – schools, health facilities, or community surveys. Your team enters data into a Google Sheet about a program’s progress, and everything seems fine. But the next day, the numbers don’t add up. Someone updated the sheet. Was it a mistake? Or did the program really change? What was the previous value?
Cue frustration.
Wouldn’t it be great if you had a way to
track those changes
automatically? Enter our hero:
DBT Snapshots
! With snapshots, you’ll never lose sight of how your data evolves. Let’s dive into how NGOs can benefit from this game-changer.
What Are DBT Snapshots?
DBT Snapshots are like a time machine for your data. They let you capture the state of a table (or parts of it) at specific points in time and store all the historical versions.
Dalgo makes it easy to ingest hundreds of data sources, and DBT Snapshots can help track changes at every step before visualizing the insights on Superset. Whether it’s a Google Sheet tracking attendance or survey results coming from SurveyCTO or CommCare, snapshots preserve the history so you can always look back and see what changed, when it changed, and why.
Why Use DBT Snapshots?
Auditability
: Track every update or correction to your data.
Historical Analysis
: Compare how metrics evolved over time.
Accountability
: Spot errors or inconsistencies in data entry.
Ease of Use
: Once set up, snapshots automatically log changes with every dbt run.
How Do DBT Snapshots Work?
Data Source
: Snapshots start by pulling data from a source like a Google Sheet, synced through Dalgo.
Unique Key
: Each row is identified by a unique key (e.g., id).
Tracking Strategy
:
Check Strategy
: Tracks changes in specific columns. If any of these change, a new row is added to the snapshot.
Timestamp Strategy
: Tracks changes based on a timestamp column.
Snapshot Table
: Stores historical versions of the data with valid_from and valid_to timestamps. The valid_to field remains blank, until the data of the row changes. Once the data changes, the valid_to field updates to the data that the data change was detected and synced – so that way, when looking at a row, you know till when that data value was accurate, and when it changed!
Requirements for Using DBT Snapshots
To use snapshots, you’ll need:
DBT Version
: At least 0.18.0 (or higher) for stable snapshot functionality.
Unique Identifier
: A unique_key column to identify rows.
Change Strategy
: Define whether you’re using check (column-based) or timestamp (time-based).
Target Schema
: A place in your warehouse to store snapshots, like snapshots.
Example Use Case: Tracking Covid Death Rates in a Google Sheet
Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of how I used DBT Snapshots to track changes in a Google Sheet:
1. Data Source:
A simple Google Sheet tracking daily COVID-19 deaths.
Check it out here!
2. Syncing with Dalgo:
I synced the sheet into my data warehouse through Dalgo.
3. Writing a Basic Model:
First, I wrote a dbt model to pull the data:
{{ config(materialized=’table’) }}
SELECT DISTINCT
“id”,
“Date”,
CAST(“Deaths” AS INTEGER) as “deaths”
FROM {{ source(‘source_demo’, ‘covid19’) }}
4. Creating a Snapshot:
Next, I set up a snapshot to track changes in the deaths column. I used the check strategy:
{% snapshot increase_death_rate_snapshot %}
{{
config(
target_schema=’snapshots’,
unique_key=”id”,
strategy=’check’,
check_cols=[“deaths”]
)
}}
SELECT DISTINCT
“id”,
“Date”,
CAST(“Deaths” AS INTEGER) as “deaths”
FROM {{ source(‘source_demo’, ‘covid19’) }}
{% endsnapshot %}
5. Running the Snapshot:
You use the dbt snapshot command to update your snapshots.
First Run
: The snapshot table captured 999 rows from the initial dataset.
Second Run
: I ran it immediately after the first run. I didn’t make changes, so it added 0 rows – as expected!
After Updates
: I edited 3 rows in the Google Sheet, synced via Dalgo, and ran the snapshot. The table:
Added 3 new rows with updated values.
Updated the valid_to field for the older versions of these rows
.
Updated rows in the google sheet:
Values in bold were changed from 0.
Snapshot table sample before changes:

Date
deaths

dbt_updated_at
dbt_valid_from

Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2019
Category: Tech4Dev project Updates

==================================================

CivicDataLab
is the recent entrant to Tech4Dev collaborative, working with the goal of connecting Data, Tech, Design and Social Science to strengthen the course of civic-engagement in the country. And one of the key aspects of our work is to help citizens better understand how public funds flow in the country and how they can work with their elected representatives to have better fiscal oversight in their geography. Here we walk you through our journey so far with the Open Budgets India initiative, in collaboration with the
Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability(CBGA)
. And then explain what we are planning to build in the next couple of months.
Background
Government Budgets determine government?s take on their promises and past decisions, prioritizations across sectors and explain the allocations for different critical sectors of an economy. Budgets are also leveraged as a tool for enabling trust in the government?s financial activities by providing transparency on public funds and can act to support impactful and equitable public policies. But to make government budgets as effective as it sounds, there is a need for Government to publish their complete budgets in a timely and easily usable format, along with disclosing a complete picture of the financial commitments
in public domain and create appropriate channels for facilitating sustained public participation in budgetary processes.
This aspect is an essential pre-requisite for the citizens at large to participate in budgetary processes for ensuring transparency, it enables increased public scrutiny on the government?s financial activities and easier reporting of misappropriating public funds. Despite these clear benefits, we still have very few open budget data initiatives across the globe and those that exist are yet in their nascent phases
The Problem
In India, public access to budget data diminishes significantly as we go deeper from the Union(Central) Government to local governments, particularly at the district and sub-district levels. This gap has constrained public engagement with locally relevant budget information and processes. Union Government has started publishing the majority of its budget documents in XLS(Microsoft Excel file format) format from the year 2011-12 onwards. But at the level of States, budget data is still not available in an easily accessible manner as some of the State Governments still do not publish the complete sets of their budget documents online and those who do, publish the budgets only for recent years, all in PDFs(Portable Document Format). As we move further to Municipal Corporations, the availability of budget documents online significantly reduces and the variation in data representation drastically increases.
Our Approach
We partnered with Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability CBGA in collaboration with a number of other research organizations and individuals to co-create
Open Budgets India (OBI)
– a comprehensive and user-friendly open data platform that can facilitate free, easy and timely access to relevant data on government budgets in India. The platform provides budget information of different tiers of government in India (Union Budget, State Budgets, Budgets of several Municipal Corporations and Expenditure data from District Treasuries across the country) inaccessible and open (non-proprietary) format.  We have 160K+ active users across the globe accessing and using 10.6K+ open datasets and numerous data visualizations on the platform.
Key Data Products
We collaborated with
DataKind?s Bangalore
, engaging in a long-term DataCorps collaboration to build
Story Generator
– an open-source tool enabling comparison of key fiscal indicators across the states and financial years. The data for this tool comprises of various receipts and expenditure indicators across twelve key development sectors for 26 states (including Delhi).
Source:
https://cbgaindia.github.io/story-generator?
We also developed Budget Dashboards for exploring Union, State and District level fiscal data. These dashboards help you navigate through data, visualizations and insights from various tiers of government to make Government Budget more usable and easy to comprehend, which in-turn increases  public participation and government accountability

Working with Governments
As a  part of a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) with Assam Finance Department to work towards strategizing and promoting fiscal transparency initiatives including publishing of timely machine-readable budget data, increasing citizen engagement in budgetary processes, etc. For the same, we conducted a capacity building workshop with representatives from various departments led by the Department of Finance on open source technology and open data policy space in India for presenting financial data, for data-driven and outcome-focused budgeting processes. Along with workshops we also developed a public dashboard
Assam Budget Board
for analyzing Assam’s budget. It allows the users to explore various aspects of the state?s budget for 2019-20 including money flow, expenditure, receipts, schemes and more.

https://assam2019.openbudgetsindia.org ?
Road Ahead
With the support of  Tech4Dev, we aim to build two key open-source data products – Open Fiscal Data Explorer for Himachal Pradesh covering their budgets and spending information, and a Child Budget Tracker covering few states in India. State-level Fiscal Data Explorer help citizens to understand state expenditure, receipts, key schemes as well as other parts of the budget like outcome budgets, sectoral budgets, etc. Along with this, citizens will be able to track monthly spending in major districts leading to increased fiscal transparency and hence eventually more public participation in the budgetary process. Lastly with the Child Budget Tracker, we aim to anchor more data-driven discourse on how public funds are being prioritized for child well-being (focusing on key areas like Child Education, Health, Nutrition) and protection in the country. These FOSS products will be pivotal reusable data solutions that can be scaled to multiple geographies in public finance and beyond.

Introduction
Education is the foundation upon which young people’s future is built. However, the purpose of education has long been a topic of debate. Is education merely about acquiring knowledge, or is it about fostering well-rounded, thriving individuals who are prepared for the challenges of tomorrow? Today, there is growing recognition that the purpose of education must evolve to prioritize the well-being, social and emotional development and enable young people to thrive.
Data plays a pivotal role in this transformation. By expanding our focus to include broader metrics—such as social-emotional well-being, holistic development, and mindset shifts—data provides valuable insights that can guide the evolution of education systems. Through research, evidence, and analysis, data can inform how educational priorities need to shift. This shift requires an ecosystem that prioritizes inclusive, accessible, and open-source data, enabling evidence-based decision-making that can drive holistic change. A collaborative data ecosystem that includes all stakeholders—teachers, policymakers, students, researchers, and NGOs—is critical to empowering young people and ensuring they can thrive in an increasingly complex world. This blog explores how such a data-driven ecosystem can drive transformative educational changes, creating a more effective and equitable future for all learners.
Beyond the Basics: Building a Comprehensive Data Ecosystem for Indian Education
India’s
UDISED+
(Unified District Information System for Education) database provides extensive data on school enrolment, infrastructure, and teacher statistics. However, it fails to capture vital aspects such as learning outcomes, social-emotional well-being, future readiness, and equity. Reports like the
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
show that learning outcomes often focus primarily on academic competencies, neglecting the broader educational experience.
The
2020 World Bank report
further underscores that while enrolment data is well-documented, there is a significant gap in data on learning quality and skills development, particularly in rural and underprivileged areas. The lack of data on non-academic aspects, such as mental health, life skills, and social-emotional learning, exacerbates this gap. The OECD report (2021) highlights that India has the least data availability on non-academic aspects of education, like well-being and future-readiness skills. Furthermore, the
Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report by UNESCO
and a
2023 study by ICSSR
stress that while infrastructure data has improved, the absence of data on emotional, social, and behavioural development undermines the effectiveness of education systems.
The Critical Data Gaps in Education
Despite advances in collecting primary educational data, critical gaps remain in understanding and tracking more nuanced aspects of student development, such as social-emotional skills, mental health, well-being, and mindset shifts. These aspects are vital to understanding how well an education system equips young people to thrive. However, the absence of comprehensive data leaves a significant void in the ability to assess and improve educational outcomes meaningfully.
At
Dream a Dream
, we recognize that data alone is not enough. It is not just about collecting data but about creating a culture that allows stakeholders—policymakers, educators, researchers, and NGOs—to engage with and use data effectively. There is a strong need for more data on how educational interventions influence students’ attitudes, behaviors, and future aspirations in India. Focusing on holistic development through data collection can empower policymakers to make decisions beyond traditional academic performance.
Dream a Dream’s Data Ecosystem
Dream a Dream has created a collaborative model integrating research, policy, and practice to bridge these data gaps. This Research-Practice-Policy Collaborative brings together key stakeholders—teachers, policymakers, young people, NGOs, researchers, and academics—united to enable every young person to thrive.
Dream a Dream has been at the forefront of educational research for over two decades, including large-scale data collection, longitudinal studies, and partnerships with global organizations like Brookings Institution and OECD. These efforts have provided valuable insights into young people’s educational journeys in India, emphasizing the need to rethink educational priorities and move toward a more holistic model.
Dream a Dream’s Theory of Change for a Collaborative Data Ecosystem
At Dream a Dream, we believe transforming education requires a fundamental shift in defining success. Traditional measures such as exam scores and graduation rates do not fully capture what it means for a young person to thrive. Education should foster holistic growth—social, emotional, cognitive, and ethical development—empowering young people to succeed in an ever-changing world.
To achieve this vision, we aim to build an inclusive, accessible, reliable data system supporting evidence-based decision-making and policy development. We believe in a comprehensive data ecosystem that captures academic progress and the broader aspects of student well-being and success.
Inclusive, Accessible, Reliable, Open-Source Data
Data must encompass many factors that affect student development, from academic performance to social-emotional skills, mental health, and holistic development. For data to be impactful, it must be reliable and accessible to all stakeholders. Open-source data, in particular, ensures that everyone—from policymakers to educators—has the information they need to make informed decisions. This openness breaks down barriers and fosters transparency in decision-making.
The lack of disaggregated data on non-academic aspects of education, such as social-emotional well-being, has been a barrier to developing effective policies. Dream a Dream is committed to addressing this gap by championing open-source data practices that provide a more comprehensive understanding of what it means for students to thrive.
Collaborative Data Ecosystem
Education reform requires collaboration. The education system includes many stakeholders—teachers, researchers, media, policymakers, NGOs, and philanthropies—each with a unique role. For transformation to occur, these stakeholders must work together in a unified, collaborative data ecosystem. This ecosystem allows for the sharing of insights, the alignment of goals, and the creation of strategies that lead to long-term, sustainable change.
Data is not static in this ecosystem; it is a dynamic tool that connects various actors in a shared mission. Policymakers use data to shape policies that support academic success and well-being. Teachers rely on data to tailor their teaching approaches to students’ diverse needs. Researchers use data to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. NGOs and philanthropic organizations use data to assess program impact and optimize resource allocation. This feedback loop ensures that each stakeholder contributes to the continuous improvement of the education system.
Redefining the Purpose of Education
At the heart of Dream, a Dream’s Theory of Change is the belief that education must move beyond traditional academic measures. Rather than focusing solely on exam results and graduation rates, education systems should prioritize well-being, social-emotional learning, life skills, and holistic learning. Data should reflect these dimensions of student development, helping to create a more comprehensive view of what it means for a young person to thrive.
This shift requires a reconceptualization of the purpose of education. Education should prepare students for academic or vocational success and equip them with the emotional intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and interpersonal skills necessary for navigating life. A thriving student is academically capable, resilient, empathetic, and prepared to face future challenges.
Dream a Dream’s Journey with the Data Catalyst Program
The Data Catalyst Program (DCP)—an initiative by
Project Tech4Dev
in partnership with
Dasra
and knowledge partner
Goalkeep
—has been a transformative force in shaping data-driven decision-making within the nonprofit sector. Through DCP, Dream a Dream has harnessed the potential of data to drive meaningful change in the educational ecosystem, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.
With the DCP, Dream a Dream launched the Data for Good Initiative, bridging technology, data, and insights for impactful decision-making. This program has empowered the organization to decentralize and decolonize data access, making insights open-source and accessible to internal and external stakeholders. This democratization of data fosters inclusivity and allows stakeholders to co-create solutions, ensuring young people can thrive.
The DCP program has enabled Dream a Dream to build a robust data culture and facilitated a reflective journey on the “where, how, and why” of the data ecosystem. By embedding data practices across the educational ecosystem, the program underscores the importance of leveraging insights to empower young people and enhance their capacity to thrive.
This pioneering initiative is a testament to the transformative power of data when it is open, accessible, and actionable—unlocking pathways for systemic change in the education sector.
Dream a Dream’s Intentions and Goals
Looking ahead, Dream a Dream is focused on expanding and refining its data ecosystem:
Enhancing the Data Platform
: Adding new data sources and improving the platform’s accessibility for all stakeholders.
Advocating for Data-Driven Policy Change
: Using data to advocate for policies that prioritize youth well-being and redefine the purpose of education.
Promoting Open-Source Data
: Expanding the availability of open-source data to encourage collaboration and transparency across the education ecosystem.
Strengthening Research-Practice-Policy Collaboration
: Deepening partnerships with government bodies, NGOs, donors, and academics to ensure a coordinated approach to education reform.
Larger Vision: Redefining the Purpose of Education
Dream a Dream envisions a global education system where every young person has the tools and opportunities to thrive. Our goal is to build a collaborative network of diverse education actors, one that drives reform and influences educational ecosystems worldwide, particularly in the Global South. By empowering stakeholders with data and fostering collaboration, we aim to democratize education data and help create a future where every young person can reach their full potential.

==================================================

This blog is written by Fatema Ranpura from
The Apprentice Project
A 3 Day Sprint to move from designing User Funnels & Design Interventions to Experimentation Design – A TAP (The Apprentice Project) case study
Organised by the
The Agency Fund
and
Project Tech4Dev
, I had the opportunity to attend the User Engagement track of the Bangalore Sprint representing
The Apprentice Project
.
This three-day event comprised two tracks: User Engagement (UE) and Large Language Model (LLM). The UE track explored using technology to make interventions more impactful through data-driven design. We delved into user funnels and metrics, identifying key stages and crafting design interventions based on user behaviors and motivations. The sprint’s goal was to create and orchestrate experiments to enhance these key metrics.
Participants mainly from India, Kenya, and South Africa representing organizations like
Rocket Learning
,
Avanti Fellows
,
Noora Health
,
Saajha
,
Precision Development (PxD)
,
Involve
,
Karya, and SameSame
attended the User Engagement track of this sprint. These organizations are doing impactful work in the social development sectors of
Edutech, Healthtech, Agritech, and Employment generation.
Key Highlights
1. User Funnels & Metrics
We started Day 1 by discussing the “Theory of Change” and its effectiveness in checking for impact in social intervention designs and program evaluations. However, to promote Evidence-based Funding, a scientific and user-centric way of measuring impact in the development sector would be to use User Funnels. A User Funnel maps out the user’s stages in the program, identifying ideal behaviors and metrics at each stage.
TAP Case study
The Apprentice Project (TAP) is a Not for Profit that delivers learning content to enhance 21st century skills through an AI enabled Whatsapp bot to marginalized children in India. It is currently catering to 34000+ children from grades 4 through 12 to ~ 250 schools.
We began by creating a User Funnel for TAP, based on pre-work completed before the sprint.
The key stages of this funnel
Onboarding:
Students are inducted into the TAP program by school teachers through a presentation on a WhatsApp group. Students register on the WhatsApp Bot – TAP Buddy to start learning Social and Emotional Learning skills.
Activation:
Once registered, students click on the link to open the first TAP video on the TAP Buddy WhatsApp bot and continue engaging with the learning content.
Engagement:
Students watch videos, submit activities, answer quiz questions, and receive digital reward points to encourage continued participation.
Retention:
Students must submit at least one of four activities monthly to remain engaged with the bot.
Feedback
Received interesting feedback on some of the nuances which could be captured in the funnel
Focus on different users like Teachers, and creating separate funnels for Teachers and Students to focus on their individual metrics.
TAP would have to define levels of engagement to be able to capture the depth of learning. Is watching a video, submitting an assignment, answering a quiz question leading to similar levels or depths of learning
To be able to create evidence based impact, TAP needs to figure out a way to connect the proximal outcomes to the developmental outcomes. eg: increase in engagement results in increase in SEL skills results in getting better jobs.
Reflections from Day 1
from other organization presentations and group discussions
There is scope of consolidating broader metrics across the social sector for benchmarking purposes to evaluate and validate our efforts eg: what are the activation metrics in edutech across social products What is the impact which a leaderboard has created
Avanti Fellows
– Watch time metric may not reflect accurate engagement, as students love skipping videos to get the right answers on the quiz PLIO.
Rocket Learning
– Involvement with parents and measuring parents activity as a metric can push students’ involvement.
2. User Experience & Intervention Design
Day 2 was all about focusing on one particular stage in the funnel, to enhance the ideal user behavior which is highly impactful
This was a 4 step process
Source: Jamie Walsh, The Agency Fund
1. Funnel Assessment
For TAP I decided to focus on
Churn
as an important metric that needs to decrease to influence the Retention stage of the Funnel. Currently, churn is defined as
the number of students who do not submit even once in 4 weeks.
2. Action Mapping
The User behavior is elaborated here,
Student should make atleast one submission in a period of four weeks, measured on a monthly basis
3. Driver Evaluation
Listed down all the possible drivers and blockers impacting this behavior. This was based on a recent user research we had just completed at TAP. Plotted these motivators and demotivators from surface to deep axis to get a clear picture
4. Idea Generation
Brainstormed design interventions which could boost the drive and counter the blocks around submitting assignments continuously for students accessing TAP.
We also explored a 4 step process to prioritise and pilot the ideas quickly to check feasibility of those design interventions
1. Prioritization:
Prioritized all the design interventions on the axis of impact vs feasibility
2. Planning:
Based on this prioritization, picked out the most impactful, yet feasible ideas to elaborate onElaborated the selected ideas as per
Theory of Change
The interventions I chose to take ahead were
Messaging It’s ok to fail – We know through User Research that, sometimes students find it difficult to understand the curriculum and find it tough, and they expressed fear of failing with the submissions. Create an empathetic tone to encourage submissions.
Commitment – Take commitment from students/parents about dedicating a certain amount of time on TAP Buddy so that they are able to engage. We heard from User Research, as lack of time can be a factor, due to the marginalised children supporting parents in their shops, businesses (eg: making flower garlands) or household chores.
Motivating Video – Sending a motivational video reinforcing the value of TAP in their lives, TAP will help them fulfill their dreams. Students expressed in the User Research, aspiration to come out of their current economic conditions by becoming something, and positioning TAP as a way to fulfilling that dream.
Feedback – Students sometimes drop out as they find the curriculum tough, hence constantly taking feedback on the WA bot and end it back to the curriculum team to formulate learning strategies around it.
3. Prototype
Prototyped a few ideas, as I was prototyping I realized I could combine a few ideas into single design interventions. Example combine motivational video with taking commitment and messaging of it’s ok to fail with feedback on curriculum. Paper prototype was created to mimic the conversational flow of the WA bot
4. Pilot
While piloting the ideas in the group (other participants role played the users persona of students, and I showcased the prototype to them)
I learnt
Future commitment would be too stringent to take
We need to give flexibility to the user to make the commitment
It will be difficult to get reactions on commitment
Reflections from Day 2
from other organization presentations and group discussions
An open source experiment registry listing down all the ideas already tried out by organizations in the social sector would be great to learn from
However would organizations be open to share data, what would be the concerns privacy opportunity cost resources
What would be the motivators to contribute to this registry maybe directly or indirectly linked to potential funding a.k.a RCTs or credibility
Also who would be the potential consumers for something like this
3. Experiment Design, Execution & Analysis
We started this day by deep diving into A/B testing frameworks. We also looked at a real world example from PxD, to learn from experimental design and the impact it could create.
Setting up the experiment included
Target Metric: Define the metric in detail, including measurement value, frequency, and the exact action to be measured.
Target Audience: Define the attributes of the target audience, such as grades, courses selected, schools, and the expected decrease in churn.
Defining the Intervention: Describe the exact design intervention introduced in the bot and the stage where it will happen.
Piloting the Intervention: Show the prototype to a small slice of the target audience to incorporate feedback before developing it further.
Experimental Design: Define the final audience and hypothesis of the experiment, including the number of students involved and the expected outcome..
Reflections on Day 3
Collaboration with other organizations in the social sector offers valuable learning opportunities. There is much to do at TAP! Notable experiments shared by Rocket Learning and Saajha can provide further insights for TAP.Conclusion
Conclusion
The event provided valuable insights and actionable takeaways that can significantly benefit TAP. By focusing on user-centric development, strategic use of technology, and fostering collaboration, TAP can drive better outcomes and continue to innovate in the development sector. Reflecting on these insights and applying them strategically will help TAP achieve its goals and make a lasting impact.Title: Trip Report India: NGOs, Funders and meeting a few legends

==================================================

Being an empty nester has its privileges. I can take extended trips, and I’m making the most use of this. Some of the team stayed on in Kenya to take a holiday, whike I flew on to India. When I was planning the trip, I did not realize that Kenya was so close to India, just a 6 hour hop across the ocean, and this allowed me to attend
Dasra Philantrophy Week
2024.
DPW in Ahmedabad
We started DPW 2024 in Ahmedabad and took a short break there. Great city, good food, an amazing long stretch of walk/bike path across the Sabarmathi river which was definitely the highlight. Spoke (actually more of sitting back and listened) on a panel with Gagan Sethi from
Center for Social Justice
and Binoy from
Unnati
. I enjoyed listening to to both of them who’ve spent so much time in the sector, their depth of understanding, their empathy, their way of looking at things over time and measuring progress.
Also spent an hour with a group of 8 NGOs from Kutch that are being supported by the
Empowerment Foundation
. Repeated a similar process in Mumbai a few days later with a group of 20 small NGOs from the
Rebuild portfolio
. A few observations from those conversations
As we grow, to be effective we’ll need to localize and communicate in the local language. Hindi does work for many of the NGO leaders, but I suspect that when we go into the field we will need to have people who can speak the state language (Gujarati, Tamil etc). Rajiv Kuchal from Dhwani foundation had mentioned this to us a year ago based on their work and interactions.
We can do a lot of simple quick and cheap things with many of these NGOs for very little money. This will enable us to position them nicely as the depth and/or scale of their work increases. I do think a cohort based model of NGOs with similar needs with a lot of support will potentially work here. Another set of experiments to do 🙂
On the way back from Ahmedabad, we took the latest fast train:
Vande Bharat
from Ahmedabad to Mumbai which was a very nice experience and show cased the progress India has made over the past couple of decades. Managed to get a fair bit of work done on the 6 hour journey as we rumbled across Gujarat into Maharastra.
DPW, Rebuild and more
The next few days were spent at DPW, Rebuild and a ton of meetings. Lots of conversations in the corridors and cafetaria. We also use events like these as introductions to technical folks who have not had interactions with NGOs of different types. We had a prospective new hire come and hang out for a few days and meet some of our existing partners and also interact with NGOs large and small. Its a really great marketing tool for us, since it shows the impact our work has with NGOs so nicely and in their own words.
Some more observations from these events
Data is becoming the new queen of the block. Many NGOs had conversations with us that focussed on data, especially on the anaylsis + visualization part and edging towards learning and experimentation. A few conversations on the feasibility, implications and business model of data sharing and responsibility.
Funding collaboratives have been successful and have the ability to raise the sector across multiple orgs simultaneously. Great examples of this include the GROW fund from Edelgive and Rebuild Fund from Dasra
Tech4Dev has a good name and brand across the sector (I think and hopefully we are not drinking too much of our own kool-aid). My days in Mumbai were packed with multiple meetings with some amazing funders and partners who wanted to learn more about our work, collaborate and more.
Meeting the legends
Mari and I visited CSJ’s office and met the team with Gagan and Nupur. It was quite nice to see how Gagan and Nupur made the young fellows on their team answer most of our questions and explain to us the importance of their work and impact. Have long been an admirer of the work they’ve done, and the visit served to strengthen it.
Had my first conversation with Dr. Anand Bang from
SEARCH
in Gadricholi. Another legendary organization doing amazing work for a long time. Kinda cool to see how the next generation of the Bang family is also deeply involved with the work. Hope to learn from them and thinking about spending a few weeks at their campus this summer.
I got to spent half a day with Safeena and Rishi and the
Educate Girls
Team. We’ve started to realize that we can play a role with large organizations also. Many of the hurdles they encounter are common across the sector. So some more experiments on these lines this year. They also nudged me to share my story with the EG team and have an open, honest conversation with them. It was a lot of fun to interact with the group and go back and forth about the role of technology, problems over solutions, the role of AI/ML going forward and is technology bridging or increasing the divide?
Met Ashif, Kapil and Nishant from the
Jan Sahas
team to get a better sense of how they should approach their platfrom from an open source, scale, multi-party collaboration perspective. Lots of different models are applicable here, but in our opinion, for NGOs to grow and strengthen the sector, we need to open-source all of these systems, and potentially govern them with the
benevelent dictato
r model to ensure everyone can benefit from the development and funding of these systems.
Had an incredibly interesting conversation with Ashok from Bhansali Trust at his place. I can spend days listening to his stories of how he thinks about the work and the comprehensiveness of their approach. Why malnutrition in children is a lot beyond nutrition only, how to understand mental health and their approach towards it, how to work with and around government systems while being in harmony with them and more.
I’d be remiss if I did not include our friends and partners forever who are also legends (in my eyes at least): Vanessa from SNEHA, Pratima from Shelter, Raj from Lend-a-Hand India, Suparna from Aangan and Naghma from Edelgive.
Wow, that was a lot of meetings!! No wonder, I’m so jazzed and inspired 🙂
Back to reality
Many of you who know me, know that while generally an optimist, there are a few things that deeply bother me. Since writing is my sort of therapy, I might as well put it out there and highlight a few concerns and/or struggles
NGOs are spending a lot of money on strategy documents via the prominent sector consulting firms. Yes, these are funded directly by the donor, but when an NGO spends approx 10% of their budget on a strategy document, I wonder if its really worth it. Can’t we use that money to pay folks in the sector a lot better?
We had a short term need of raising Indian money for our NGO in India, so we can put it on the track for an FCRA application in a few years. I reached out to a small set of funders in our network. The good news was we had 3 of them respond quickly and offer their help asap, which resolved our situation. Its great to see how supportive the sector is. Thank you to the funders who responded.
Talking to some of the organizations I mentioned above, I’m sad that they dont have a long line of donors wanting to support them with minimal hassles. The work that Gagan, Nupur and team at CSJ, Dr. Bang and his family at SEARCH in Gadricholi, they deserve our whole hearted support with minimal questions and process. If you’ve gotten this far, and can afford to, please go support these or other similar institutions
While I love Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and Tech4Dev has benefitted immensely from that (Dalgo, Avni and Glific are all DPGs), the term is being overused, mis-used and destroyed at an incredible rate. Observed this both in Kenya at a funder talk and in India with some NGOs and funders. Building an open source platform is a lot of time, investment and hard work. The support, documentation and improvement is even more expensive from a resource and commitment perspective. Lets get real folks
We work with NGOs large and small quite actively and try to be as helpful as we can. Very recently a fairly large NGO went with a competitor (even though their offering is inferior compared to Glific). In this case, we’ve been reaching out to them proactively over the past year, have interacted with folks multiple times over the course of the year, but did feel blindsided by their decision and lack of communication. Our goal is to build a trust based ecosystem, and for that I do think clear and open communication is important. We understand reasons why folks might choose someone else, but letting us know about it and why would help us a lot.
And finally, in my continuing saga of getting old and forgetful (why, oh why!), I managed to forget my phone this morning at the check-in counter in Delhi. Luckily I remembered at security, and the airline staff managed to retrieve it. Unfortunately, I dont think this is going to get better, so I’ll need to add even more tricks to my arsenal to minimize similar things from happening. ARGHHHHHHH
This has probably been my longest blog post, so i better stop here. These serve as important memory markers and are great to read and reflect upon after a few years or even a decade! Ended the day having dinner with Erica (our CEO) and Sneha (Glific BizDev lead, new Tech4Dev Mom!)

==================================================

I just got back from
Merida, Mexico
where I had the privilege to attend the Responsible Leaders conference held by
BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt
. It was a really good experience and an incredibly well-organized event attended by close to 400 people. This post gives me a chance to reflect on some of my learning and takeaways from the conference and how we can incorporate it into future events that we are part of. Before I go into details, I?d like to thank Barbara Mueller from the foundation for inviting me to be part of the network. I?d also like to express my deep gratitude and heartfelt thanks to everyone at the BMW Foundation along with their on-ground partners in Merida for organizing this amazing event. Without further ado, in my normal style of listing things, here?s my list based reflection of the event
Organizing a conference at such a large scale is always a hard thing. Things are rarely on schedule. However, this conference ran like clockwork. Everything started and ended on time across multiple haciendas spread across relatively large distances. To some extent, it did seem like we spent a lot of time on buses traveling across Merida and the Yucatan. However, it was also by design and accomplished two important things: We got to see and appreciate a new culture and place, and it also helped us get to know our seatmates and have a longer more extended conversation with then. Also, the changing of the venues on a daily basis gave people the freedom to intermingle and meet new people multiple times during the event.
Two things that struck me about the foundation and the board. The humility of the board members and the generosity of the foundation. As Marcus (the board member of the foundation) put it so nicely when we had a conversation on the bus: To a large extent, it is a gift by the foundation to the leaders. They?ve done this quite a few times to know that this gift will keep on giving down the line in ways that they may not even foresee. The power dynamic that we typically see in many conferences (at least the Indian conference I?ve attended) was never seen here. The board and staff at the foundation were as involved in all the sessions and activities as the rest of the participants
This was also to a large extent a transaction-less conference and a major networking event. You never knew who you were going to meet on the bus or around the dinner table. People were interested, in who you were, what you did and why you did it. So the conversations were long, diverse and ranged across multiple topics. It was not an NGO conference, nor a social impact conference. If there was a theme, it was probably meeting and learning a lot from people who are trying to do good in the world in their own ways and style.
Another amazing aspect was the geographic breadth and sector-wide diversity of the people attending the conference. From business to social entrepreneurs, from bankers to NGO leaders, from environmentalists to media folks it was a wide spectrum. There were folks have been attending the foundation events for the past 20 years, and there were folks like me who were new. Folks who attended every single event, and people who just reconnected with the conference because it was in the right place at the right time.
Another participant mentioned to me that connections aren?t really solidified until some time after the conference. That makes total sense because it does take a while for folks to think about their conversations and the people they met and how their work may or may not intersect. In some cases, it happens after a few years. As with many things, there will be a few short term wins from a collaborative perspective, but it’s the long term wins over a period of time that the forum lays the ground for.
Many parts of the forum were organized like an un-conference. Having attended and organized a fair number of these, I do love the format and flexibility of this style. You can contribute to a session if you know a lot about a specific topic, or learn about something totally new if you are interested in one. As with other un-conferences, the success of a session depends on the coordinator and the participants in that session. At one of my sessions, the moderator had done some research into each of the participants and their background and this did help structure the conversation really well. The nice thing about the gathering was the ?everyone? sessions were kept around 60-90 mins, covered multiple high-level topics, and made people get out of their seats and do things. The smaller group un-conference sessions were much longer: 90 -150 mins and did allow in-depth explorations and discussion.
Interestingly enough, we did have a Tech4Dev session. It was a bit strange to see how different people interpreted the word and the session, but overall it was a well-run session and we hope to make this a bigger priority going forward.
They did make good connections about their location choices and why they were made. The forum did a great job tying the larger objective to the place that we were having our conversations. The pace of the conference was relaxed as it should be with a ton of ?empty time? in-between, that allowed people to either have conversations or for folks like myself (who can only talk for so many hours in a day), go off and wander in the large event spaces.
We also did a bit of journaling a couple of times. I thought they handled this aspect really well. Not a lot, but doing it at super key moments, giving folks time to reflect and think back.
I was quite surprised by this, but even though a fair number of the participants had attended past events and knew each other, all participants made the newbies feel super welcome and immediately drew them into the conversation.
Finally, for such a large conference, the food and wine were incredible. We were fed super well along with copious amounts of caffeine and sugar 🙂
So a few things, I?m still trying to rationalize and figure out the role it played in the conference and its importance
I would have liked to see (maybe online on the app), some high-level points on what each of the smaller sessions discussed. This potentially gives you a basis for having a conversation with a few folks based on sessions that you could not attend.
Another participant made this comment, and I kinda semi-agree with it. A lot of the networking happened with random collisions and who you ended sitting next to etc (especially for the newer folks). I do love random collisions for a large part, but is there some more structured way also to augment it?
It seemed to me that not too many folks were aware of the open-source/open-data movements. Personally, I think these things are super important if we want to share things with the world and try to not rely on the network to provide the information every time.
As with many un-conferences, a lot of lists and action items are created. I don?t know the community well enough to know if progress will be made on at least some of them. From my end, I do hope to contribute and help the Tech4Dev session action item list.
A couple of interesting logistical and operational numbers. The foundation had a team of 7 people working on the conference quite intensely for 6 months.  A few of them were on the ground in Merida to continue the preparation for 6 weeks before the conference. They had more than 40 local partners to help with everything from food and drinks, to transportation and venue staging. For many of the events, we had around 9 big buses to take us to the various haciendas. The haciendas chosen for the meetings and dinner were spectacular.
Overall, I?m glad I attended. I learned a lot, made a lot of new friends and got a much broader exposure and a more global perspective of the work done by others around the world. There is a lot of synergy between what we do at Project Tech4Dev and with many of the NGO / Social Impact folks at the forum. Here’s looking to more collaborations and adventures.Title: Trip Report – Sustain2020 and FOSDEM 2020

==================================================

Late last week, I attended
Sustain 2020
and half a day of
Fosdem 2020
. This was thanks to my former colleague at
CiviCRM
, Michael McAndrew who had written an incredibly detailed blog post on his
experience at the second Sustain Summit.
Since we are working on a couple of open-source projects at Tech4Dev, I decided to attend the conference to learn and get a better idea of what?s happening in the space right now. So, a few random thoughts, observations, and comments:
The conference was facilitated by Gunner @
Aspiration
, who did an amazing job of getting people on the same page, talking about and directing people to be focused and making the day fun and lively. Personally, I loved that sessions had ‘coming up with an explicit set of next steps’ as their output.
The agenda was determined collaboratively before the conference with the participants. The format throughout the day was small group discussions and knowledge sharing, you pick the things you are interested in.
As with any word,
sustain
, means different things to different people. I was amazed at the breadth of the topics that come under what sustainability means to organizations. From financials to governance, from community management to licensing, from contributions to organization transitions and a lot more.
It was awesome and encouraging to see so many companies present and active at the conference. Even better was the presence of the Ford and Sloan foundations. I?m glad that these foundations are supporting sustainability and open source and hopefully demonstrating to other foundations the importance of doing so.
I?ve been involved with non-profit tech (nptech) open source for good for a long time now. So to a large extent, we have been content in our little bubble. At Sustain, I realized that this aspect of open source is such a small percentage of all the amazing open-source work going on out there. There are differences in the ecosystem of NPtech open-source projects compared to the others (smaller developer base, committed NGO user base with an in-built ethic of sharing and doing good), but also lots of similarities.
There were a few NPTech organizations: Simpy Secure, CiviCRM, Ushahidi, and Avni/Tech4Dev, however, we were missing many of the other prominent NPTech open-source projects at Sustain or Fosdem (OpenMRS, Kobo, ODK, Medic Mobile, Kolibri, MiFOS, ?). I think it is important in future for the NPTech community to be a part of these events for multiple reasons:?
They get the exposure and share their learning to a much wider group.
Others can learn from their experience.
All of these projects have done an amazing job for years and decades. It is important to celebrate that as part of the larger open source community.
We should create a track at Fosdem 2021 for NPTech
While I thought the agenda was largely focussed on multiple aspects of sustainability, I do wish that there was a sharper focus on it. There were quite a few sessions, where I found it hard to draw a link to sustainability.?
I always think of: what are my learnings from any conference/session I attend. In some cases, it is sharing my experience. In other cases, it is getting a quick education and/or learning from other people’s experiences. Connecting with people who are doing similar things and/or folks you can collaborate with. I do think there are potential areas of collaboration for Tech4Dev with SimplySecure and other individuals.
Given the above, I do think some of the sessions should have focussed on conveying specific things to the group during the discussion. This was important during the first round-robin session, where I was expecting to get a better view of some of the topics. I?m a bit biased here, but the sessions also seemed a bit sponsor heavy.
One of the last sessions I attended was giving feedback to a group on building a database of the monetary grants that open source projects receive on a yearly basis. This has been a need for a long long time, and I?m glad to see other folks also thinking about it. The
project scope document
is being created as we speak 🙂 This could potentially make an interesting research project for Tech4Dev
On my way to the conference, I learned about a
seed grant for Open Source Projects
facilitated by Open Collective, Mozilla, Ford Foundation, Indeed and others. I decided to apply on behalf of
Avni
with a focus on using the grant to help build the community. The amazing thing about the process was the group really minimized the time and effort that they required from the applicants. The application was super short and simple. The ?speed dating? session was 15 minutes long – no PowerPoint, no demos. They have a great format on how to structure your 5-minute pitch. I lucked out since one of my judges knew a fair bit about mobile data collection and hence understood the need and importance completely. It would have even better if they had announced the results at the end of the evening 🙂
It also ended up also being a mini CiviCRM reunion. I met a few members of the Civi Community, and Civi had a booth at Fosdem along with videos and marketing material. I did a couple of interviews with Alain and Nic about the origins and motivations behind Civi. It is personally so gratifying to see the community be so active and present at events.
I?m glad I made the trip over the big pond to attend the events. I learned a few things, made quite a few good connections and hope to collaborate with a few folks in the next few months, doing good togetherTitle: Two Way Communication Project Kickoff
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: May 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/two-way-communication-project-kickoff/
==================================================

After a fair bit of planning, we finally kicked off the two-way communication project earlier this week. Our kickoff meeting was May 11th, 2020, though we had an email discussion going the previous week. Super excited to finally get started on the project and come out with a solid two-way communication platform for use by the social sector.
Briefly, the platform will allow the staff at an organization to communicate with their end-users in an easy manner, keep track of the different conversations happening with each user, assign a group of users, or cases to be handled by a specific staff person and more. This will initially target users on WhatsApp via its Business API. An example use case is a public health NGO interacting with a patient after they have left the hospital/clinic and ensuring they are following all the post-hospital instructions. This also gives the patient a channel to ask questions to the NGO staff and seek help as needed. Over a period of time, common questions can be answered automatically by the system. The blog posts in the next few weeks will detail more use cases and some of the features in the first release.
Features at a Glance
A Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for NGOs to communicate with their users frequently in an easy, intuitive way.
The communication could be structured or unstructured with content tailored for the end-user on WhatsApp.
Easy to build chatbots, based on either response from the user or date/time/schedule based delivery.
Organizations can have multiple people using the platform at the same time.
Over time, as the system learns a pattern of questions and responses, use technologies including AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate the simpler tasks.
Team Information
Personally, for me (
Lobo
), it brings back good memories of starting
CiviCRM
, 15 years ago, a project still going strong with an amazing community ecosystem behind it. We plan to learn and improve from that experience, building on things that worked great, and avoiding our previous mistakes. It’s an honor and privilege to kickstart the project with Kurund from
Web Access,
who was part of
CiviCRM
‘s founding team.
We have three partners from Project Tech4Dev involved in the project currently:
Colored Cow
,
Think 201
, and our long term collaborators
Web Access
. Colored Cow and Think201 are contributing 2 developers and a part-time project manager/design resource. Kurund from Web Access will use his experience and expertise to help manage the overall project, with a focus on the front end. For the first few months, I will be leading the backend aspects of the platform.
The TwoWay Team
In the first week we spent a lot of time listening to 4 NGOs, and the problem they are solving using WhatsApp Business API. The discussions were quite energetic with the team asking a lot of questions to the NGOs. The main purpose was to give the team a solid sense of the needs of these NGOs, their current challenges, and to expose them to the different ways different folks are thinking of the problem. We do believe that interacting with our end-users on a regular basis is super important and will be having presentations as often as we can.
We are using a lot of new technologies (to us) both for the frontend and backend. As such, we need to do a fair bit of homework, catching up and learning functional programming, Elixir, GraphQL, Phoenix, React, Redux, and more. We expect to continue on our learning and research phase for the rest of this month.
Since we are split up between the Bay Area, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi, all our meetings are remote and online. We’ll be having standup meetings three times a week and the backend and frontend groups will meet on a daily basis for peer discussion, learning, and pair programming.
Quarterly Goals
Choose a name for the project and build the base infrastructure: Website, GitHub Repository, and Community Chat Channel.
Define product features for the first three releases.
Build and rely on an NGO Advisory Group. Use them in our human-centered design approach.
Release v0.1 within 3 months from the project start. Post that, there will be monthly releases.
Build a pipeline of potential NGOs that can use the platform in v0.3+
Get two more foundations/funders on board before the end of the year.
Our commitment to you
All our work will be transparent and published on Google Drive, on our website, and/or on our GitHub repository.
All our software work will be licensed under
GNU AGPL v3
. All our documentation will be also be licensed under a free and open license.
We will follow best practices to manage, create, and sustain a vibrant and thriving open source community and ecosystem around the project.
We will blog about the project on a weekly basis at least. Blogging duties will be rotated among all the team members.
We will release early, release often and use automated testing as much as possible along with good documentation to ensure the quality of the product. Eventually, we will get to a predictable release cadence so downstream users know what’s coming.
We will be transparent about our financials and our funding sources.
How can you help?
If you are an NGO that communicates with your users frequently, we’d love for you to talk to our team. We are also forming an NGO advisory group that will meet monthly.
If you are a foundation and/or funder and are interested in supporting this work, please do get in touch. Project Tech4Dev is seed funding this project, but we are looking for additional funding partners. You can email us at
tech4dev@chintugudiya.org
If you are a software company interested in joining the project, send us an email. We hope to make this a lot easier after our v0.1 release where you can contribute to our public GitHub repository.

==================================================

Participating in my first-ever meetup, the Sprint, was an incredible experience that not only allowed me to step into the world of offline collaboration but also opened my eyes to the remarkable work done by various NGOs. This event was a source of learning, networking, and witnessing first hand experience of how organisations are making a difference in society. In this blog, I will share my wholesome journey and the valuable insights I gained from this Sprint.
We had an opportunity to connect through digital platforms initially but the experience of connecting with the team in person was refreshing. One of the highlights of the Sprint was the opportunity to interact with numerous NGOs and gain profound insights into their work. Through panel discussions, presentations, and casual conversations, We had the privilege of learning about their missions, values, and the incredible impact they were making on various communities. These interactions provided a deep understanding of the challenges faced by NGOs and the approaches they apply to address social issues effectively.
During the Sprint, we had the chance to visit the Aajeevika office, an organisation dedicated to upholding the fundamental rights of labour. Witnessing their work firsthand was truly awe-inspiring. Aajeevika not only ensures that labourers receive their rightful wages but also provides skill training to empower them for better opportunities. The total amount recovered by Aajeevika on behalf of labourers can exceed 1 crore in a single month. Additionally, the fact that labourers sometimes receive a 20% to 30% wage increase through their efforts highlighted the tangible impact of their work.
Participating in the Sprint helped me realize the immense willingness people have to give back to society and assist others in need. It reinforced the idea that we all have a role to play in contributing to the betterment of society.
There were plenty of questions, many of them were answered but one remained unanswered “Who has given that restaurant India’s 6th healthiest restaurant title?Title: Udaipur Sprint: Learning’s from Glific Chatbot and Data Platform

==================================================

The Udaipur Sprint organized by Tech4Dev for Glific training and Data Platform for NGOs proved to be an exciting and enriching experience, opening up new possibilities for SNEHA organizations. Inspired by the knowledge and connections gained during the event, our organization is now eager to pilot a small project in the Mumbai Bhiwandi area, specifically focusing on the child immunization module using Glific Chatbot. By integrating the Glific Chatbot into our child immunization module, we aim to streamline and improve the vaccination process for children in the Mumbai Bhiwandi area. The chatbot’s capabilities will enable us to automate reminders, provide information on immunization schedules, and address common queries from parents. This approach has the potential to enhance communication, increase immunization rates, and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for children.The Udaipur Sprint provided valuable insights into the functionalities and integration possibilities of Glific Chatbot, making it the ideal choice for our pilot project.
My journey began when Mr. Vinod connected me with the Tech4Dev and Glific teams, enabling me to dive deeper into the world of chatbots and data platforms. Their guidance and support were instrumental in helping me gain hands-on experience and understanding of these technologies.
Mohit played a crucial role in assisting me with creating a Facebook business account, which had been a struggle for me initially. His expertise and patience helped me overcome the challenges, and I was able to set up the account successfully.
Krishna Priya, another valuable member of the team, oriented me on Glific and its various functions. Her insights and explanations provided a solid foundation for me to explore the platform’s capabilities further.
Akhilesh, a knowledgeable individual, extended his assistance in creating my first chatbot workflow. With his help and the integration of Google Sheets, I was able to gather valuable data seamlessly. Within a day, I successfully created the chatbot workflow and tested it on WhatsApp, marking a significant milestone in my learning journey.
One of the highlights of the Udaipur Sprint was the discovery of Glific’s integration with ChatGPT. This integration opened up a world of possibilities, combining the power of chatbots with advanced language processing capabilities.
Having used a Business Intelligence (BI) system for the past four years, our organization recognizes the importance of staying updated with the latest data platforms. With the rapid advancements in technology and the potential offered by Tech4Dev Data Platform, we believe it is an opportune time to upgrade our system. Furthermore, meeting Siddhant in person after our previous online connection regarding the Data Platform was an enriching experience. Not only was he incredibly knowledgeable about the platform, but he also proved to be a very down-to-earth personality. Working closely with him provided an ideal platform for insightful discussions and extensive knowledge sharing on the intricacies of the platform.
Siddhant’s
expertise and guidance were instrumental in helping me overcome some of the issues I faced with the DBT aspect of the Data Platform. His patient and thorough explanations helped me gain a deeper understanding of the functionalities and best practices related to DBT implementation.
I truly valued the opportunity to collaborate with Siddhant and learn from his extensive experience in the field. His approachability and willingness to share his knowledge further enhanced the learning experience. The discussions we had not only addressed my immediate concerns but also broadened my perspective on how to leverage the Data Platform effectively for the benefit of NGOs.
Overall, the opportunity to collaborate with Siddhant and benefit from his expertise was a highlight of the Udaipur Sprint. I am thankful for his down-to-earth nature, willingness to help, and the valuable insights he shared, which significantly contributed to my growth and development in working with the Data Platform.
During the Sprint, I had the privilege of conversing with
Sanjeev
, who shared his experiences in building the
CommCare
connector for us. His expertise and insights were invaluable in understanding the potential of the platform and its applications for NGOs.
Additionally, I had the opportunity to provide feedback on the Data Platform, contributing to its continuous improvement and enhancement. Tech4Dev’s openness to feedback and suggestions was commendable, emphasizing their commitment to delivering the best possible solutions for NGOs.
Engaging with interns and listening to their Sprint experiences was a source of great excitement for me. Their fresh perspectives and enthusiasm added a vibrant element to the event, leaving me inspired and motivated.
In conclusion, I am immensely grateful to Tech4Dev for organizing this remarkable Sprint, which not only expanded my knowledge but also provided networking opportunities with other NGO team members and partners. The Sprint has ignited our enthusiasm to leverage Glific Chatbot to enhance our child immunization module in the Mumbai Bhiwandi area. Additionally, the Data Platform will empower our organization to effectively collect, manage, and analyze data, further improving our healthcare initiatives.
I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Tech4Dev, the Glific team, and all the partners and NGO team members we connected with during the Sprint. Their support, knowledge sharing, and collaboration have been invaluable. We are excited about the journey ahead and the positive impact we can make through the implementation of the latest technology in our mission to improve child healthcare. Together, we can drive meaningful change and create a brighter future for children in our community.

==================================================

Another great Tech4dev sprint took place in the beautiful city of Udaipur. When you hear the word Rajasthan, an image of a desert may come to mind, but Udaipur is quite the opposite. Surrounded by hills, our hotel provided a breathtaking view of the beautiful monsoon palace covered in fog. It was truly a sight to behold.
I will now divide my experience into different parts, highlighting the interactions I had and what I hoped to achieve during this sprint.
C4GT
Students
I had the pleasure of meeting an amazing group of people, young engineers who will soon become the face of India in the tech world. My hope was to help them see the world through a tech and social lens, inspiring them to make an impact beyond just considering the monetary and technical aspects of their jobs.
Coming from a tech background myself, I feel fortunate to have gained this perspective at an early age, and I am hopeful that I can make a positive impact on many lives.
Glific Mobile App
I was particularly excited about this sprint because we planned to launch the first version of our mobile app. The C4GT students put in a tremendous amount of hard work to make this a reality, and it was finally time to unveil it.
I was impressed with the presentation that Aman and Vishal prepared for the launch. The excitement was palpable, and we received valuable feedback from many individuals on areas we can improve for future versions. Unfortunately, we were not yet ready for iOS, which meant we missed out on reaching a significant number of people. However, addressing this is part of our roadmap.
Attaching to

for the playstore to try it out and give feedbacks.
Internal Team Assessment
During this sprint, we conducted an internal team assessment for Glific and DDP with Ashwin. It allowed us to have constructive discussions on various areas where our team could improve. We divided the assessment into nine categories and rated each one on a scale of five. If there were differing opinions or low ratings, we took the time to discuss and resolve these differences as a team.
Ashwin asked us to prioritize two categories that we wanted to focus on improving, encouraging further team discussion. Here are the assessment
results
for those interested.
Discussion with NGOs
This part of the sprint always reminds me that there is so much more work to be done, and we have only scratched the surface. Specifically, when it comes to the Glific product, sitting down and talking with individuals who use it daily brings numerous issues to light, along with suggestions for improvement.
We discussed not only the product but also support processes, documentation, and providing sufficient resources for organizations to implement their programs effectively using Glific.
Naming of our Product DDP
We provided everyone with an opportunity to
suggest
a name for DDP and held a vote to determine the best name that perfectly represents our product. The results have not been announced yet, but I hope the best name is chosen.
Presentation on Glific Integrations
Over the past year, Glific has made significant progress, and we now support numerous native integrations, thanks to the different organizations in our ecosystem. We aimed to raise awareness among all NGOs about these integrations, enabling them to explore the potential benefits for their own programs. Often, people are not aware of the possibilities Glific offers, so this was a chance to showcase the impactful work of various organizations.

After work, we took the opportunity to visit tourist attractions in Udaipur. We visited two places on different days. First, we explored the City Palace, where we learned about the history of Udaipur and its rulers. We also purchased Bandhani printed shirts and kurtas. Next, we visited Sajjangarh Fort, which offered a stunning view. This fort is known as the Monsoon Palace because the king used to come here during the monsoon season to enjoy the refreshing air and lush greenery.
For our dining experiences, we tried two different places. The first was Khamma Ghani Restaurant, located by the lake. The view and seating were remarkable. The following day, we went to Traditional Khana restaurant, where we indulged in the deluxe Thali, which included all the delicacies of Rajasthan. If you ever visit Udaipur, this Thali is a must-try.
Last but Not Least
Meeting people with diverse backgrounds and interests was a wonderful experience. It truly helped us move closer to the vision of openness and collaboration that Tech4dev aims to achieve.
I really missed having Kurund and Sneha with us during this sprint, and I’m hoping to see them in the upcoming sprints real soon.Title: Udaipur: Sprint Day 2

==================================================

Today, we had the pleasure of a visit by Dr. Pavitra Mohan from Basic HealthCare Service.
BHS
delivers medical care to people in Rajasthan who cannot afford it. Their services include vaccinations, blood sugar checkups, and diagnostic services. They employ doctors and over a hundred nurses in their centres around Rajasthan.
Dr. Mohan educated us about the social environment in which they work. Many of their patients have never visited Udaipur, which is the nearest big city. Additionally, most women patients live within 15 km of their birth village, and even men who work in cities rarely leave their construction sites where they eat and sleep.
BHS focuses on preventative care because it is more cost-effective. By targeting a population that cannot afford to pay, they find ways to avoid unnecessary costs. As a result, their average cost per patient is around Rs 400 per year.
Dr. Mohan also discussed other aspects of their service, such as providing guidance to patients referred to hospitals. Since hospitals can be intimidating, especially for those who rarely leave their homes and villages, BHS assists patients in navigating the hospital system.
Over the past fifteen years, Dr. Mohan and his team have faced and overcome various challenges. One positive development is the improved supply of nurses. Previously, they had to hire nurses from cities who would eventually return. Now, they can hire nurses from the communities they serve, who better understand the people and can empathise with them.
While funding remains a challenge, Dr. Mohan explained that they have considered running a for-profit service to subsidise the not-for-profit one. However, they decided against it as it would divert their focus and resources. Instead, they hope that state-provided medical insurance will cover non-hospitalization care. There are positive signs, including some pilots being run by the Central Government, that this may happen.
We were very thankful to Dr Mohan for taking the time to speak with us and look forward to any future interactions we may have with BHS.Title: Udhyam POC with Dalgo UI4T

==================================================

At Tech4dev, our mission is to empower people in the social sector to enhance their program outputs through technology. Dalgo is designed to streamline the entire data process from source to visualization, making it accessible and affordable.
The Challenge
Data is crucial for gaining insights into program performance, whether through feedback or implementation metrics. Early access to high-quality data enables better decision-making. However, many non-profits lack the technical expertise to manage their data effectively. They often rely on data engineers and consultants, leading to complex SQL transformations or using transformation tools that only a few understand. Hiring skilled data engineers is also costly.
Dalgo addresses these challenges by integrating the entire data pipeline process from data sourcing to visualizing key metrics into one platform at an affordable cost. Our latest enhancement, the Dalgo UI for Transformation, simplifies this process further.
Key Features of Dalgo UI for Transformation
User-Friendly Interface
: No need for writing complex SQL statements. Users can build data transformation workflows using a simple flowchart interface.
Affordable and Accessible
: With basic database and visualization tool knowledge, users can create their pipelines in Dalgo.
Comprehensive Data Management
: Combines data extraction, transformation, and visualization in one platform.
Case Study: Udhyam’s Vyaapar Program
Program Overview
Udhyam Vyapaar
aims to empower nano-entrepreneurs in India, known as Vyapaaris, who earn between INR 5000 to INR 25000 monthly. The mission is to help these entrepreneurs reach their full potential, scale their businesses, and succeed in life.
Data Collection and Challenges
To engage with Vyapaaris, Udhyam conducts surveys using Kobo Toolbox. However, Kobo’s built-in dashboards and generic filters are insufficient for program-specific insights. Initially, Udhyam used R and custom code to extract data from Kobo, store it in Google Sheets, and visualize it in Looker Studio. This approach had several limitations:
Maintaining R code and managing cron jobs.
Handling form changes and new form introductions.
Joining and cleaning multiple tables for insights.
Google Sheets limitations with large data sets.
Dalgo’s Impact
Dalgo streamlined Udhyam’s data process without the need for code, all within 6 hours. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
1.
Data Warehouse Setup
: Udhyam used PostgreSQL as the data warehouse, managed through Dalgo.
2.
Data Source Integration
: Added Kobo Toolbox as a data source, providing the necessary credentials.
3.
Data Sync
: Connected Kobo Toolbox to the PostgreSQL warehouse, selecting specific forms and sync types. Data was transferred via manual or scheduled syncs.
https://videopress.com/v/LrtZgTkf?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true
4.
Data Transformation
: Using Dalgo’s UI, Udhyam joined three forms using a key phone number, dropped unnecessary columns, created new columns, and produced a final output table for visualization.
5.
Pipeline Maintenance
: The visual interface made it easy to maintain and debug the pipeline.
https://videopress.com/v/xiC4Ixtb?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true
6.
Data Orchestration
: Defined intervals for running the pipeline.
7.
Visualization
: Used Superset (bundled with Dalgo) for visualization, though any BI tool could be used since the data is in the warehouse.
Conclusion
Dalgo’s UI for Transformation feature can improve Udhyam’s data management process, demonstrating the power of user-friendly, integrated data solutions for non-profits. By simplifying data transformations and visualizations, Dalgo enables organizations to focus on their mission without being bogged down by technical complexitiesTitle: Unconference at Tech4Dev Pune conference

==================================================

Recently, I got the chance to attend Tech4Dev conference organized by Social Alpha & Chintu Gudiya Foundation in Pune on 30
th
Nov and 1
st
Dec.
The event brought together a bunch of passionate techies ? from freelancers to women entrepreneurs ? bound by a common resolve to crack different societal problems.
The
unconference
format of the conference expedited the ice breaking between the participants and enabled people to choose and create their experience of the conference together. In less than few hours, participants were interacting and suggesting their areas of interest. The comfort was evident from the fact that some of the participants decided on the spot to demo their work.
As one of the posters in the conference mentioned ?The Law of Two Feet? which can be rephrased as ?If you feel you?re not learning from or contributing to the discussion ? wherever you?re, please make use of your feet and move to a more interesting group for yourself?.
The days were filled with mainly discussions and demos, and few keynote speeches. Pratima Joshi?s talk on Shelter Associates?s early struggle in the 90s to getting funds for data and technology to effectively improve the living conditions of urban poor in India was quite insightful. It stood in contrast to today?s world where data is recognized as the new oil.
The discussions and demos in the conference were varied and interesting. The demos ranged from healthcare, education, water to urban challenges. The brainstorming session to use the traffic data available in Andhra Pradesh to figure out the number of employees required at RTOs (Regional Transportation Offices) was interesting. Lakeer and Shelter Associates showed how opensource GIS mapping tools can be leveraged for impactful decision making to choose the services required in different areas. I personally loved the open source water testing demo by Samuel from ffem (Foundation for Environmental Monitoring) which showed a quick, easy and inexpensive way to test water for various pollutants. The discussion on creating a platform for open sharing of solutions to different societal problems in the development sector ecosystem was hailed be everyone.
I left the conference with a bundle of ideas, resources, people and a long to-do-list.

==================================================

By: Dawit Taddele Dessie
As Tech4Dev continues to navigate the dynamic landscape of East Africa’s civil society, we’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the incredible work being done by these organizations. From the inspiring stories of DEK and SHOFCO to the insightful discussions at the Tech for Good Fest, AYPN Connect, and the T4D-hosted Roundtable on technology,
Can Lessons from India Be Applied to East Africa?
The short answer is yes. The lessons learned from tech development in India can certainly apply to the East African civil society sector. However, it’s important to consider the unique context and challenges faced by CSOs in this region. At the heart of our efforts is a suite of open-source, user-friendly platforms: Glific, Avni, and Dalgo. These tools are designed to streamline operations, enhance outreach, and equip CSOs with the data-driven insights necessary to make informed decisions.
Witnessing Impact on the Ground
Our visits to Deaf Empowerment Kenya (DEK) and SHOFCO were particularly inspiring. DEK’s livelihood projects and outreach to communities in Machakos, in collaboration with SHOFCO and local government, have resulted in a strong foundation, especially through their innovative approaches to youth engagement. SHOFCO’s deep-rooted connection with the community was evident in their respect as a de facto government support system. Their innovative solutions, such as the water and token systems and the youth insurance program, were well-tailored to the local context and demonstrated a remarkable impact.
Tech for Good Fest: A Catalyst for Change
The inaugural in-person Tech for Good Fest in Nairobi provided a platform for leaders from the social impact, technology, and funding sectors to come together and explore the potential of technology to address pressing global challenges. Key takeaways from the sessions included:
Building AI capacity in the social sector requires equitable data collection and partnerships with the private sector (Woodrow Rosenbaum, GivingTuesday).
SameSame’s chatbot demonstrates the power of technology in mental health, providing essential support to young people struggling with depression (Codie Roelf, SameSame).
Hello Tractor’s success highlights the potential of technology in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on youth involvement and a hybrid model that combines technology with community interaction (Jehiel Oliver, Hello Tractor).
T4D’s Role
The T4D team co-facilitated a session on AI for nonprofits, emphasizing the importance of bridging the digital divide, leveraging AI for measuring impact, and addressing concerns related to responsible AI usage. Additionally, the T4D Nairobi Roundtable provided a valuable opportunity to connect with representatives from leading CSOs in Kenya, discussing shared challenges and opportunities for collaboration.
AYPN Connect: The Power of Collective Action
Our participation in the AYPN Connect event reinforced the importance of collective action, mentorship, and innovative solutions in the evolving field of Civil Society Landscape. The observation that “challenges and use cases of CSOs here are quite similar to those of Indian CSOs” suggests the applicability of our learnings from other regions.
A Promising Road Ahead
The past week has been a valuable learning experience, offering a deeper understanding of the East African civil society ecosystem. We’ve made significant strides in building relationships and uncovering collaboration opportunities. While challenges lie ahead, we are optimistic that with the right tools and a commitment to fostering partnerships, we can navigate them successfully. This region holds immense potential for collaboration and cross-learning, making it an exciting space for impactful work.Title: Vanna.ai vs Askametric

Disclaimer:
This was a first attempt at comparison and did not involve deep fine tuning of prompts. Our goal was to take the tools and see how they would compare with minimal prompt engineering and database knowledge. Fine-tuning the system message and DB description for both systems and other augmentation of the LLM with data schema might yield better results.

Experiment
I connected both the tools to a local
Prefect
database that has been running
Dalgo
development(or local)? pipelines and asked a bunch of questions –
What is the distribution of deployments per org ?
What is the distribution of flow runs by org ?
Tag each flow run to its deployment name and the work pool it was executed or belongs to
With each question, the complexity (no of joins) of the query will increase. Lets see how the tools performed on all these questions
Training
Askametric
doesn?t require any training as such, it only needs a system prompt and the description of the database as follows.
Vanna.ai
was trained on the information schema and the database description used above
Results
Q1. What is the distribution of deployments per org ?
Vanna.ai
Query generated –
SELECT 
    tags->>0 AS organization, 
    COUNT(*) AS deployment_count
FROM 
    deployment
GROUP BY 
    tags->>0;
It got the correct information from the correct place expected. It also gave a table of the output distribution of above query along with the summary below
The distribution of deployments per organization shows that most organizations have only 1 deployment, with one organization (test_auto) having a significantly higher count of 63 deployments.
This description is also accurate. In my dev environment, i usually play around with one org when i working on Dalgo & hence that one org ?test_auto? has the highest count of deployments
Askametric
Query generated –
ProgrammingError: (sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.ProgrammingError) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedFunctionError'>: operator does not exist: text ->> unknown
HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
[SQL: SELECT parameters->>'config'->>'org_slug' AS org_slug, COUNT(*) AS deployment_count FROM deployment GROUP BY parameters->>'config'->>'org_slug';]
(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)
Askametric couldn?t figure out that the information is in the ?tags? column which is of Jsonb type, although this was mentioned in the database description & should have been part of the context.
Q2. What is the distribution of flow runs by org ? (requires one join)
Vanna.ai
Query generated –
SELECT 
    deployment.tags->>0 AS organization,
    COUNT(flow_run.id) AS flow_run_count
FROM 
    flow_run
JOIN 
    deployment ON flow_run.deployment_id = deployment.id
GROUP BY 
    deployment.tags->>0;
It figured out the correct join to do. It also gave a table of the output distribution of above query along with the description below
The distribution of flow runs by org is as follows:
- test_org_check: 1
- dev: 4
- test_auto: 753
- delete-later-11: 2
- dev-bigquery: 8
- new-org: 1
- delete-later: 4
Askametric
Query generated –
ProgrammingError: (sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.ProgrammingError) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedFunctionError'>: operator does not exist: text ->> unknown
HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
[SQL: SELECT d.parameters->>'config'->>'org_slug' AS org, COUNT(fr.id) AS flow_run_count FROM flow_run fr JOIN deployment d ON fr.deployment_id = d.id GROUP BY org;]
(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)
Askametric couldn?t figure out the correct join and the subsequent query. It’s the same error as above where it tries to read the org information from a different column but not the column mentioned (?tags?) in the database description.
Q3. Tag each flow run with its deployment name and the work pool it was executed or belongs to (requires 3 joins)
Vanna.ai
Query generated –
SELECT 
    fr.id AS flow_run_id,
    fr.name AS flow_run_name,
    d.name AS deployment_name,
    wp.name AS work_pool_name
FROM 
    flow_run fr
JOIN 
    deployment d ON fr.deployment_id = d.id
JOIN 
    work_queue wq ON d.work_queue_id = wq.id
JOIN 
    work_pool wp ON wq.work_pool_id = wp.id;
This is super accurate. Figured out the all correct tables and all the correct joins. The description it generated is also correct, I have only two pools in my local setup ?dev_dalgo_work_pool? and ?default-agent-pool?
The data contains flow runs tagged with their deployment names and the work pools they belong to. Most flow runs are associated with the "dev_dalgo_work_pool" and "default-agent-pool" work pools. The deployment names vary, with many related to airbyte-sync, dbt-run, and pipeline-test_auto executions.
Askametric
Query generated –
SELECT fr.id AS flow_run_id, fr.name AS flow_run_name, d.name AS deployment_name, wp.name AS work_pool_name
FROM flow_run fr
LEFT JOIN deployment d ON fr.deployment_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN work_queue wq ON fr.work_queue_id = wq.id
LEFT JOIN work_pool wp ON wq.work_pool_id = wp.id;
The query is accurate. Askametric figured out the right tables and the right joins. However, it couldn?t summarize the results like vanna ai did.
However, the response to the SQL query was too long to display here. To get the specific details, you would need to run this query in your database management tool to see the full list of flow runs along with their corresponding deployment names and work pool names
Conclusion
As per the preliminary analysis,
Vanna.ai
did a better job than
Askametric
. I am not sure if the answers could have been better with some fine tuning of system prompt & the database description for askametric. I didn?t go down that route.?
As per Dalgo?s points of view, the apis
Vanna.ai
offers are very handy & can be easily integrated in our ai/llm service that will be exposed to Dalgo or in general tech4dev platforms.Title: Visit with Noora Health
Author: Rohit
Date: February 2025

==================================================

Rohit Chatterjee, Feb 2025
Every few months I visit Noora’s office in Indiranagar. We all enjoy the face-to-face meeting and their being only two metro stops away from me is an added bonus.
It was a large meeting – Abhishek, Ammar, Harsh, Jake, Nikhil, Poorva, Santhosh, Sreeram, Vineet from Noora, and Ashwin, Pratiksha and myself from Dalgo – eight of us in the room and the rest over Google Meet.
I started by giving them an update of what the Dalgo team has been up to since our last meeting, the major part of which was our transition of Airbyte to Kubernetes. Poorva was already familiar with this since she was led the majority of this transition effort while volunteering with Project Tech4Dev last quarter. I then told them about our recent sprint in Mahabalipuram and the roadmap we announced as well as the feedback we received during that workshop.
Noora is a client who is not terribly interested in AI, we know this and they know that we know this. They are much more interested in data sync and orchestration and in fact have suggested several enhancements in the past which have been included into Dalgo. This meeting also produced a host of suggestions which have been added to our backlog, including:
Cancelling a queued job
Cancelling a running sync
Auto-cancellation of a “clear” job which is taking too long
Show the position of a pending job in the queue along with an estimate of when it will start
Categorize notifications by type and allow users to subscribe to the ones they want
Run daily connectivity checks on sources and the warehouse
Replace Prefect logs with Airbyte logs in the Pipeline History page (for Airbyte jobs!)
Some error messages should move from a toast to the main page so they don’t disappear
Publishing our Elastic IP addresses in our documentation and in the platform
In addition to these there were other requests which I need to look at in more detail before adding to our backlog, such as
Can Airbyte copy a small subset of data from a source, so the user can inspect it before syncing the entire dataset?
Can we include a “Generic HTTP request” as an orchestration action?
They also asked, and not for the first time, about our upgrade schedule. This is something which I need to decide on and publish for visibility to all our clients and partners.
Once this part of the discussion was complete, we moved on to talking about Dalgo’s upcoming Chat with your Data feature. I showed them what we already had, and the modifications we have in mind for our next release at the end of this month. They asked what would be sent to the remote LLM service (OpenAI or whoever else), and what our plans were for masking PII (answer: replace with UUIDs). They suggested that in some cases we might be able to avoid sending raw data to the LLM, and instead ask for Python code using which we could summarize the data and then send those summarized results to the LLM. They asked about token windows and cost monitoring, and enquired into whether we could connect to a self-hosted LLM should they choose to run one.
All in all it was a good meeting, I certainly came out of it with a lot of actionable feedback, and they all said they were pleased as well.Title: WHEN COOKIES TELL STORIES: insights for opencity from google analytics

==================================================

Three months ago,
Oorvani Foundation
and
CivicDataLab
embarked on a collaborative journey to redesign
OpenCity
, an urban data portal visited by over 50,000 unique users
every month.
We set out to learn about our users, their experiences on the platform and their dreams for the future of this city based open data hub. An important part of our research is to understand data provided by
Google Analytics
. Lets first meet Client. No. 1931, our top user.
Meet Client No. 1931: Our top user
His first visit to the platform was on April 21, 2018. In the next 21 months, Client No. 1931 visited OpenCity 914 times, and spent nearly 89 hours on the platform. Hes definitely someone with a wide interest in the city of Bangalore, confirmed by his frequent visits to city based pages on ward maps, street maps, election results, traffic signals etc. Occasionally, hed visit Chennai Corporation maps as well. He was last seen on January 12, 2020. Has OpenCity lost its top user? To answer the question, we have to understand how Google Analytics works.
What is Google Analytics and how does it work?
Are we alone as we traverse through the vastness of the internet? No. We are followed around by benignly named, yet predatory
cookies
that store information about us and our activity. Google Analytics uses cookies (and other
techniques
) to identify and understand us better through our online behaviour. Thats how they are able to tell us that between May 16 and June 15 of this year, 73% of all users of OpenCity were male. Its also how Google is able to tell us what percentage of users love cooking, and how many are travel buffs. Client No. 1931 had a cookie in his computer that recorded information about his visits to OpenCity diligently for two years. On January 12, 2020, the user disappeared. Did he abandon OpenCity?
Cookies are linked to a browser-device combo. If you use multiple browsers on your desktop, each combination of browser and desktop has a separate cookie. Client No. 1931 used a single browser+desktop combo for nearly 21 months. His disappearance can be explained by a variety of reasons, none of which can be conclusively identified.
Cleared browser history and cookies
Changed Desktop
Abandoned OpenCity
Are you feeling queasy about the information collected by Google? Its not unusual. The debate around Googles web-traffic monitoring practices and its implications for privacy is an important one. What are the options available for not-for-profit, open source data platforms like OpenCity to move away from a freely available analytics platform, to a costlier, but more ethical web analytics service? For now, rest assured that no personally identifiable information is provided to OpenCity by Google Analytics.
OpenCity – Performance
With this collaboration between OpenCity, Tech4dev and CivicDataLab, we envisage to make the platform
more accessible
and effectively
increase the advocacy efforts
. We plan to create city level pages detailing high-level statistics and analytics to drive more research from the platform. With these changes and via few workshops and working sessions with data collaborators, we aim to
improve the citizen uptake, usage and contribution to the platform
From the Project Plan document agreed between CivicDataLab, Oorvani Foundation and Tech4Dev, its clear that the intention of this project is to increase usage by citizens. To do that, we should understand the current usage patterns. We looked at analytics data for two financial years, 2018-19 and 2019-20 to better understand how the platform has been performing.
Number of Users and Duration of Usage
The insights were concerning.
Numbers of users and sessions fell year-on-year by nearly 18%.
During the same period, average session duration went down by 14%
Bounce Rate, a measure of the % of users who leave the site without interaction, went up from 71.4% to 73.3%
Occasional spikes are observed in usage, especially around local or national events like elections. For example, Open City had more than
100,000
unique visitors in May 2018. Why? Elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly were held that month. However, quarterly, half-yearly, and 12-month moving average of the number of users and average session duration on OpenCity show a declining trend.
User Demographics
As pointed out earlier, most of the users of OpenCity are male (~60% in the last 2 years). Majority of the users are also in the age bracket 25-34. However, theres a not-so-insignificant number of users who are older. 11% of them are above 55.
Usage Pattern
One important information we need as we prepare to redesign OpenCity from the ground up is to know what works right now. In the first three months of this year, 3 out of the top 5 performing pages on the site were map based, with a session duration thats more than double the site average. Coupled with the interviews of users weve had, Its clear that they prefer interactive elements, including maps and visualizations.
Way forward
While Google analytics gives useful insights, its important to see it as only one part of the larger puzzle of understanding what users want. Our team has been conducting several in-depth interviews with current and potential users of the platform. In the next blog, well talk about the distilled insights from our design research phase. Meanwhile, listen to CivicDataLabs first ever podcast episode on this very same project.

Author: Siddhant Singh
Date: July 2024
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/waterbody-rejuvenation-project-a-t-e-chandra-foundation/
==================================================

Introduction
Through collaborative efforts with state governments and various stakeholders, ATECF successfully rejuvenated over 5,000 water bodies, impacting 10 million people across 7000 villages by implementing an efficient rejuvenation process. Utilizing a coordinated technology strategy for the intervention using tools such as  Avni (operational data collection), Dalgo (Data ingestion and analysis), Superset (Data Visualization), Glific (Whatsapp chatbot for troubleshooting the AVNI-GRAMIN APP), Vowel LMS (to train farmers) enabled not just operational efficiency but also quantifying impact and enabling decision making among government officials,  donors, and  on the NGO sides as well.
Project Overview
In partnership with State Governments (like Maharashtra),NITI Aayog, non-profit organisations and other donors, ATE Chandra Foundation (ATECF) has helped implemented Rejuvenated Water Bodies(RWB) to tackle the issue of silt accumulation in water bodies across nine states: Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Karnataka.
The initiative was started in 2013 following a severe drought in Maharashtra, which underscored the urgent need to enhance water storage capacity in the existing, local water bodies. The fertile silt removed from the water bodies using earthmoving machinery is made available to farmers for free, who cart them to their farmlands at their own cost.
The project is tech-enabled, cost-time-effective and community led. To monitor the progress of the project, ATECF uses a mobile  app called Avni-Gramin which captures all the information like Farmer details, water body (WB)details, how much silt is carted by each farmer, how many hours the machine has worked for, how many acres the silt is spread on, OTP verified contact number of the farmer, etc.
Data Collection Method
The
Avni
Gramin platform provides a way to easily model entities like Farmer, Waterbodies, Workorders and associate forms with them for longitudinal tracking. Its features, which include the ability to work without internet, phone number verification, approval workflow and role-based access have helped to build a robust data collection solution for the project.
An on ground implementation partner is deployed to mobilize communities and monitor the ongoing work at a waterbody level. This partner deploys a Community Resource Person (CRP) at every waterbody to monitor the rejuvenation work and collect data. The NGO and CRPs are trained on using Avni Gramin via  physical and video training modules before the start of implementation. Once work starts, the CRP has to enter the following data on the App:
Farmer Registration:
Register basic information on the app, specifying their name, landholding category, verify their contact number using OTP
Work Order Registration
: CRPs
also register work orders for specific locations where they are responsible for working on water bodies. Multiple work orders can be assigned to the same water body.
Machine Registration:
This form tracks the types of machines used for desilting the water bodies.
Gram Panchayat Registration:
This form registers the Gram Panchayats involved in the projects where the silt is infertile and carted by GPs for levelling of land, road development, etc. .
Post-Registration Data Collection
Daily recording of silt excavation is done through:
Work Order Daily Recording – Machine
:
Tracks the time taken by machines and the   type of machine used on a daily basis .
Work Order Daily Recording – Farmer
: Records the amount of silt carted by farmers on a daily basis .
Farmer Endline Form –
This data is crucial for tracking the farmer benefit outcome from the RWB project. Upon completing their work, CRPs fill out this form detailing total silt carted, total land on which this silt has been applied and if they plan to shift  the cropping pattern as well. It also mandates uploading documents as needed by the Government regulations (Eg: Panchanama in Maharashtra).
Gram Panchayat Endline
–
This form is filled by the CRP with details of silt carted by the GP and use of the same.
Work Order Endline Form –
If the work is completed on a particular waterbody, the CRP fills out this form that their work order is completed with details of all total silt excavated and government documentation recording official data on total silt excavated.
Dalgo Adoption
Our open-source data platform enables NGOs to harness the power of data by automating data consolidation, transformation, storage and visualization on a unified interface.
This ensures that you spend no time on repetitive manual data crunching and can direct your efforts towards the use of data to monitor and evaluate your impact. Learning, iterating and communicating your impact internally and externally.
Challenges Faced and Solution Implemented
Challenges:
Data Integration Complexity
: Integrating diverse data sources across multiple states and programs posed to pull data from multiple sources and an impact dashboard across all these sources.
Data Quality Assurance
: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across various reports and dashboards.
Scalability
: Developing a scalable solution to handle increasing data volumes and additional data sources over time.
ATECF
depended on
JASPER
reports, and the AVNI team helped develop these reports. However, there was no integration of data from AVNI, Glific, and Vowel LMS.
Solution:
Data Ingestion
: Data is collected from various sources (Glific, Avni, Vowel LMS) and sent to Dalgo.
Data Transformation
: Dalgo processes and transforms the ingested data.
Data Warehousing:
The transformed data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
Visualization
: The stored data is then visualized using Apache Superset for insights and analysis.
Various Factors
1. Unified Data Platform
: Implemented Dalgo as a unified data integration platform to consolidate data from multiple instances and sources like Avni-Gramin, Glific and Vowel LMS
2. Automated Pipelines
: Developed automated data pipelines for timely and accurate data collection.
3. Rigorous Testing
: Conducted extensive data validation and testing using DBT to maintain data quality on a continuous basis. Added significant test cases to improve the data quality using the elementary feature.
Why is data quality important?
Data quality ensures accurate decision-making, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency. It enhances customer satisfaction through reliable insights and personalized services. High-quality data helps in day to day monitoring, enhancing the efficiency of public spending.
Avni Dashboard Requirements
ATE Chandra Foundation (ATECF) aimed to build a comprehensive set of dashboards to showcase the impact of their various projects to government officials, enabling them to make informed and timely decisions. The key requirements for the dashboards to demonstrate the overall impact across programs with various agencies like NITI Ayog, GDGS (Government of Maharashtra), and projects supported by philanthropies
Overall Program Impact
Overall Silt Excavated (Per Program)
: Display the total amount of silt excavated, segmented by each program to provide a clear overview of progress.
Silt Target vs. Silt Achieved (Percentage):
Compare the silt excavation targets with the actual achievements, presented as percentages to highlight performance relative to goals.
Poor Performance Districts (Silt Excavated):
Identify and highlight states/districts that are underperforming in terms of silt excavation, enabling targeted interventions.
Completed and Ongoing Waterbodies:
Show the status of waterbody rejuvenation projects, categorizing them as either completed or ongoing to provide a clear project status overview. The Work Status Chart is showing how many water bodies are completed and on the left they can see clearly which state/district has excavated the most silt.
Active Farmers (Per Program):
Track and display the number of active farmers involved in each program to measure engagement and participation.
Vulnerable Farmers Breakdown
: Provide a detailed breakdown of vulnerable farmers, possibly segmented by criteria such as income level, landholding size, or other relevant factors.
The above charts show that in  Uttar Pradesh many farmers have not verified their mobile numbers.
Ensuring Farmers are verified and traceable through OTPs – and tracking how each state/district has done to ensure sanctity of this data
In the pie chart it shows total farmers and how many are from vulnerable categories.
On the right we have all the categories of farmers.
Machine Efficiency Benchmarking:
Provide a way to see if the machine is able to achieve the benchmarking which is set. JCB and Poclain have certain benchmarking and we?re trying to see which state/district has achieved the benchmarking. This also helps identify outliers where data is well above benchmarking highlighting errors in data entry.
By implementing these dashboards, ATECF aims to offer a consolidated view of their projects’ impact, facilitating better decision-making for government officials and improving overall project management.
Data Transparency and Accessibility
In addition to the dashboards, Dalgo provided a transparent way for the team to view raw data at each step, including:
Registered farmers, work orders, and machines.
Daily recordings for farmers and machines.
Aggregated data for the dashboard.
This approach allows the team to track data flow at each stage, can search, and download CSV files, which is particularly useful for reporting and sharing purposes. The inclusion of farmer_id enables comparison with AVNI Mobile data, ensuring consistency and accuracy
Glific Dashboard
In the GDGS work ATECF is using Glific to resolve any problem while accessing the Avni app. So we?ve built dashboards which can help the team to identify the most asked questions and which questions/flows needed the maximum human intervention..
In the pie chart below, we track which flows in Glific & therefore work streams in data entry on Avni where people are asking the most questions.
Data Culture Building And Dashboard Usage Adoption
Dalgo has a built-in feature to track usage of Superset dashboards
so that the team can evaluate dashboards being used and also identify users not using the dashboards. Since ATECF works across multiple states and government bodies, this feature helps track usage across different state implementations and allows the team to push with users to encourage data driven decision-making. With this, the data culture can be nurtured and built among internal and external teams to ensure dashboards serve users and users are encouraged to better use data to run operations and make decisions.
Accomplishments During the Engagement
450+ hours spent over the entire development process with a focus on automation of processes, reliability, maintainability and scalability of the system to other states in the future.
Integrated 6 diverse data sources for AVNI and developed over 10 data pipelines.
Created 14+ comprehensive dashboards and over 100+ detailed charts, including those for Glific.
Designed 101 data models and executed 500+ data test cases in DBT to ensure data quality.
Enhanced the Avni connector by integrating two additional APIs with the support of the Avni team.
Identified and prioritized
multiple issues
in Avni for prompt resolution.
Developed custom dashboard filters to enable multidimensional data views.
Collaborated closely with the Avni team to deepen understanding of their data.
Resolved numerous issues in Jasper Reports during the data validation process.
Overcome significant challenges in data validation, dedicating extensive time to resolving issues in both Jasper and Dalgo reports.
Developed ingestion connector for Vowel LMS that can be reused by other Vowel LMS users
Conclusion
ATE Chandra Foundation’s Waterbody Rejuvenation Project exemplifies the power of collaborative efforts and advanced data management in addressing critical environmental challenges. By leveraging innovative technologies and fostering strong partnerships, ATECF has made a significant impact on water management and community development. The success of this project serves as a model for similar initiatives, demonstrating the importance of data-driven decision-making and sustainable practices.Title: Weeklong Sprint at Gurgaon
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: April 2022

==================================================

As Glific continues to expand, it already has over 40 NGO partners and is in talks with many more. Kickstarting this quarter, we continue in the spirit of our sprints where the entire Glific team meets in person and invites our partner NGOs as well for a weeklong sprint to learn more about their use cases and difficulties, and to assist them in completing a few items from their future to-do list.
For this sprint, we were hosted by the
ColoredCow
team at their Gurgaon office from 11th April 2022 to 15th April 2022.
Overview of the week
The week was packed with work plans with our NGO partners and insightful talks.
STiR Education
:
Collaborating with Aparna in brainstorming sessions and structuring flows for their upcoming program aiding teachers in receiving adequate support from their supervisors and evaluating the type of support received.
Alohomora
:
Sneha from Alohomora led a session on the issues her NGO is seeking to solve, what are the various programs they are running and how they hope to use Glific to aid their cause
Reap Benefit
:
An insightful discussion with Gautam Raj where we discussed Reapbenefits experiences with chatbots, as well as what common metrics we can incorporate into v3.0 Glific data studio templates to provide our partner NGOs with data studio reports regarding the general health state of their chatbots straight out of the box.
Hyperverge Academy
:
Catching up on the Women in Tech fellowship program with Gayatri and Shruti from Hyperverge, retrospecting the program so far, and planning for the upcoming weeks for the fellows
Talk by Bharti Ali from HAQ CRC:
An eye-opening experience for everyone where Bharti shared her experience working in

==================================================

Another quarter, another team meeting, another sprint with our software + data partners in the ecosystem and NGOs using Glific and/or DDP. This is one of our larger sprints, with the entire Tech4Dev team along with the Avni team meeting in Udaipur for a week of planning, user research, design, and coding.
In addition to the team, we also have a few ecosystem partners:
GoalKeep
,
Social Bytes
,
Agency Fund
,
Dasra
attending this sprint along with our partner NGOs: SNEHA, Key Education Foundation, Quest Alliance, The Apprentice Project, Primal Foundation, Reap Benefit, Udhyam, Bharat Rohan and Lend-a-Hand India. We also have 7 interns from
Code for GovTech
who are contributing to our platforms also attend the sprint.
It’s been such a nice journey to see how these gathering have evolved over the past 18 months. Our first gathering post-Covid was approximately 18 months in
Tehri
. It was more of a broad gathering across a few NGOs and partners with no specific focus.
The pendulum has swung significantly since that sprint. The sprint in Udaipur is super focussed with 5 verticals of Tech4Dev (Glific, Data Platform, Fractional CxO, Avni, Finance & Management) having their own agendas, participants and sprint schedule. The nice thing about such a gathering is the cross pollination across different groups during the morning talks, at various meals, evening excursions and early morning walks.
Introductory session with the Tech4Dev and Avni Teams where we discuss culture, principles and roles
To me the best part of these events are the morning walks where you get to have deeper conversations with folks and the meals where you learn more from people you’ve never met. In addition, sampling the treats that people get from all over India and the world is quite special. It’s also gratifying and nice to watch the team execute and run these events with minimal input from me. Some sights from our morning walk and evening outings.
To help us learn more and get a deeper understanding of the ecosystem, as part of the sprint we are getting participants on two NGO field trips (thank you to
Ajeevika Bureau
and
Basic Health Services
). We are also having their team come and spend time with us during the sprint.
Looking forward to reading other
people’s take on the events
and getting to meet lots of new folks.Title: What I loved about the GarudMaachi Sprint

URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/what-i-loved-about-the-garudmaachi-sprint/
==================================================

This being my second time participating in the Tech4Dev 2.0 sprint (following the one in Gurgaon), I thought I had a fair idea of what to expect. With a wide smile plastered to my face, I’m happy to write that this one exceeded my expectations, and to put it in a few words – I simply had a blast!
I am walking away from this sprint with tons of learnings from organizations who are a couple of years ahead of us in the journey (for someone early into the game, this was a goldmine), having initiated a bunch of potential collaborations, spent a relaxing time in the midst of nature and the best part of all- having made so many friends! (yes, I said friends, not connects)
Heres what I loved the most about this sprint:
Informal spaces to spend time together
What I didnt anticipate and the best part about this sprint for me was that right off the bat, the entire atmosphere was super informal and casual which allowed free conversations to flow. We were all living, working and having fun together which inevitably led us to bond well.
Lunch and dinner conversations were something I was always looking forward to (along with the surprise of which soup we were going to be served). Lobo challenged us to sit with a new group of people every meal – I didnt count but I think many of us actually did that!
Post dinner shenanigans like super competitive (sometimes aggressive) card games, karaoke night, (and a mafia night I skipped :() broke the ice even further until it was a river flowing like the 100,000 waterfalls we saw along the way (sorry, not sorry). The late night and early morning long conversations with my roommate Krishna Priya reminded me of my good old college days and how wed spend hours discussing and solving problems.
I also got the chance to go on a couple of short treks/hikes in slippers and rain, it was really a miracle I didnt break my legs.
NGO/Tech Talks from diverse organizations
From an education NGO perspective – it was super interesting to observe the work done by different orgs at different levels ranging the entire spectrum of a childs learning journey (early childhood and foundational: KEF, PAF, to primary/secondary: TAP, VOPA, SOL, Reap Benefit to senior secondary: Antarang Foundation, LAHI, Avanti Fellows).
It was also super inspiring to learn more about how each org approaches learning so differently (through civic action, art, music, games, slam poetry, questions embedded in short video lessons and what not) and how each of them leverages tech to amplify their impact. There was something new to learn from everyone.
Thanks to a bunch of people working with school children and teachers, we were bestowed upon with super fun energisers which Im going to take away for all my post-lunch meetings (Neha – Im talking peel banana and Tejas- thanks for NGOs of Wassepur). Whoever is the person who has the spreadsheet of all known energisers under the sun, please do share it with me.
Working sessions and Collaborations
Working sessions with the tech partners werent super relevant for our organization since we are more of an ecosystem partner that aims to diversify the tech space (we dont use Glific or Avni etc), but I never felt out of place since there was scope for collaboration with almost every single organization that was present here. Source learners from education NGO organizations and get them placed at software partner organizations! (sounds simple when put like that, wish it were so simple in real life)
I also spent some time reminiscing about the
work
we did with Reap Benefit more than a year ago, during the Covid 2nd wave (one of the projects were super proud of), and finally shared that code with the Glific team! We learnt that this integration could be super useful for other organizations as well.
Beautiful surroundings and weather
Finally, the place we were put up was so extremely beautiful and breathtaking. The rains brought the entire place alive, and Id never seen so many waterfalls in my entire life put together.
Also, monkey (and frog) sightings, witnessing Ranjanas superpower of recognising bird species through their calls, not being able to hear what people are saying since its raining cats and dogs outside, are just some of the memories I will take with me from this beautiful space.
For me personally however – the icing on the cake was having Mohd Taqi Afsar be a part of this sprint. Taqi was one of our learners at
HV Academy
and is currently pursuing an internship with
Samanvay Foundation
contributing to Avni. My biggest pitch to education orgs and software partners at this sprint was – what if one of your beneficiaries is able to pursue a career in software development and able to sit at this sprint with all of us. Im hoping we could see a day where we have more developers from under-represented, under-resourced and under-served communities sit at this table (
Women In Tech
latest update here). Yes, there are challenges we are struggling with, and its a long road ahead, but I dont think that day is too far away.
P.S. Huge huge shoutout to
Arun Kadekodi
for being the rockstar organizer who pulled this off and being, as someone said – the youngest person in the group. The energy was contagious!Title: WhatsApp Simulation within Glific
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: October 2020
Category: Glific
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/whatsapp-simulation-within-glific/
==================================================

Glific aims to empower non-profits to take their communications to the next level through seamless integration with WhatsApp. While the larger goal is to help various organizations solve severe social problems like illiteracy, climate changes, gender oppression, etc, we also need to make sure that the tool is getting utilized to its best. This means that our primary users, the non-profit staff, should get a seamless user experience.
Problem
One of the primary features we released recently was the
Automations
. They enable organizations to have automated but meaningful conversations with the beneficiaries, hence ensuring that the core problems get resolved. With such ambition, the team did a lot of hard work to get the pieces stitched together and provide a seamless tool for the users.
Automation workflow in action
The first few trials with non-profits seemed to be aligning with our vision. However as things scaled up and complex automation started coming in, we figured that the outcomes were difficult to measure. We were left with few choices:
Rethink and probably restructure our whole automation feature, or
Create learning resources and train the users on how to effectively use the automation feature, or
Figure out a way so that the users can easily measure automation outcomes.
Rewriting the whole thing was too big of a task. We clearly wanted to not redo everything. Also, creating learning material was too much. Our aim was to create a simple and easy-to-understand system. Hence, we were only left with the third point.
Solution
The team came up with the idea of a simulator that would allow testing a real use-case from a single screen and live editing and testing for automation. This will help with the following:
Fewer back-and-forths
Once automation is created, it needs to be tested thoroughly so that it can cater to a general audience. This needed a lot of trials with the actual end-users and use that feedback to make it close to perfection. These trials will be avoided at the root level by non-profit staff testing the automation flow using the simulator.
Less time to market
New automation added can be tested more readily and accurately which in turn reduces the time to make it available for actual use.
End-user impersonation and minimizing errors
While using the simulator, one can experiment with inputs that could be provided by the end-user and make sure edge cases work perfectly.
WhatsApp Simulator in action
To make our vision more aligned, our design team created a UI for the simulator and it simplified our task a lot. The interface looked exactly like WhatsApp which gave a sense of having an actual phone with WhatsApp installed in it.
With the simulator in place, the team is looking forward to getting all the setbacks resolved by the end-users. It will not only help non-profits to understand what their beneficiaries need but also find creative ways to test the automation to their extreme use cases.Title: When 1+1 is 11 !

==================================================

This blog is written by Ankit Saxena,
Fractional CxO at
Reap Benefit
and
Indus Action
through Tech4Dev
I recently joined the
Tech4Dev
group and got an opportunity to participate in the 5 days long sprint at Dehradun. This was my first opportunity to interact with the rest of the tribe and NGOs. The initial 2 days were dedicated to discussions around knowing the different platforms that have been built for NGOs and how different partners such as
HyperVerge Academy
,
Aam Digital
,
Dasra
,
Dhwani RIS
, Samanvay Foundation,
Soft Corner
and
IDInsight
are running different (but focused with a common objective) programs in the social development space. I got a much better understanding of the different use cases which
Glific
and
Avni
are supporting, different NGOs that are using these platforms, and the kind of impact the NGOs have been able to create by leveraging these platforms. I was amazed by the passion and enthusiasm with which everyone shared their experiences and work.
The next 3 days were dedicated to discussions around the work different NGOs were doing, the challenges being faced, and how they have used technology so far to enable and deepen their work. Each NGO presented its work and also shared its future plans and strategies. These discussions were deep and gave an excellent opportunity to other participating NGOs to learn from each other. I could see people collaborating and discussing in smaller groups on common interests.
The most amazing thing that I experienced was how the complete ecosystem of Tech4Dev members, software partners, NGOs, and funders is collaborating together with some solid values and principles for a greater objective and creating a much bigger value and an impact that none of us could possibly create working in isolation.
Some of the memorable moments/ discussions for me –
Excursion to Robbers cave – the force of the water was so extreme that it was tough for us to keep the ground; many found their slippers floating away. We all had kept our stuff in a locker and we lost the key to it. The lock had to be cut to get our stuff out! Hats off to Lobo who led the gang deep into the waters (I didnt follow them though)
Nature walks – Out of the many, the one where we got lost was the most remarkable. It was supposed to be a 30 mins walk but it turned out to be a 2-hour one. We were a group of 9 people and we witnessed different emotions while we were lost. We used to ask the locals about directions and everyone would tell us that we were going in the wrong direction, but we kept moving forward in the opposite direction. We were looking for water and a bridge as a landmark near our resort! We never accepted that we were lost and kept going on and on. Finally (not sure how) we decided to take a U-turn and thats how we managed to find out way back.
Mussoorie trip – though a very short one and was rainwashed, we enjoyed it a lot, especially the different flavors of antakshari that we all played
Mussoorie trip – with Rahul from

He is working as a fractional CxO with Sneha and would lead this platform’s development. Again super excited by this and would find opportunities to contribute.Title: Why we are choosing Jasper reports after using Metabase for so long
Author: Kurund Jalmi
Date: June 2020
Category: Avni
URL: https://projecttech4dev.org/why-we-are-choosing-jasper-reports-after-using-metabase-for-so-long/
==================================================

For the last 4 years, we have been using
Metabase
to create reports and dashboards for all our customers using
Avni
. Metabase is a really nice tool. It’s feature-rich with an easy user, query, reports, and dashboard management. It has a user-friendly interface. A person with a little excel experience can use Metabase and start analyzing data if the underlying schema is simple. Avni, being a generic product, the schema is a bit complex and not conducive to out of the box analysis using Metabase. For most cases, we have been writing reports using custom SQL reports option of Metabase.
As we started having long-running projects, the data size started to increase, and there were complex reports requirements on bigger projects. We started facing roadblocks with the current feature set of Metabase. Wherever possible we started using some workarounds. It was time to start looking for another open-source reporting solution that would solve our below problems especially for biggers projects:
Big queries involving unions bringing down database availability.
Long-running reports which used to timeout on the users.
Bad interface for linking reports for drill down use-cases.
Not able to have the Reports in multiple languages.
Cascading filters
Out of all the open-source reporting / BI products available,
Jasper Reports
seemed like a good fit. So we gave it a spin. We?ve done some initial spikes, found it to solve our problems just enough, and have decided to go ahead with it on a couple of projects. We have created a few reports using Jasper. So far so good.
Let?s delve deeper into the problems and how we are able to overcome them
Big queries involving unions bringing down database availability
There are many reports where clients want to see trends for different indicators together. In Metabase, there is no way to have separate queries whose output can be shown together in one report. So we have to combine queries for each indicator using SQL unions and form one single big query. A sample report looks like the image below.
Running these kinds of big queries started causing a spike on memory and CPU, at times making the database unavailable. Throwing more resources wouldn?t be a scalable approach because as and when data volume increases this problem will keep arising.
Jasper has a concept of sub dataset or sub reports, which means now each of the unions will be an individual query. You can also configure these sub-datasets to use the same DB connection as the main report so that each of these individual queries doesn?t run together in parallel and doesn?t make the database unavailable.  This means that we can control the database load by controlling the number of connections in the DB connection pool settings. Although now reports might become slow because each query runs one after the other but we fixed this using report scheduling and report snapshots which is discussed next.
Long-running reports which used to timeout on the users
Another thing that we wanted was to schedule these slow running reports and save the result into the reporting server so that the user doesn?t have to wait long for the result. Metabase provides caching of the long-running reports. However, we found this caching solution is quite simplistic. For the reports having filters caching does not work if you change the filter value. And most of our reports have filters. Also when caching expires the first user opening the report still faces the problem.
On the other hand, using Jasper reports one can enable data snapshots feature and reports can be scheduled for the different filter values. A new snapshot is created for each filter value, these snapshots can be refreshed periodically using report scheduling. Now every day a new report snapshot is created which the user can view instantly and doesn?t have to wait. Users can schedule reports themselves as well. This not only creates significant improvements in user experience but also prevents load on the database during the active hours.
Linking reports for drill down or navigating to other application
Providing hyperlinks in reports is a great way to enhance user experience. For instance, aggregate type reports can be linked to the line list report, so when a user clicks on any number they get to see all the information for that indicator. We also use hyperlinks on the line list reports where users can click on any name and they are redirected to the actual record on the Avni web app. In Metabase to achieve this, we have to add a new column and pass all the filter values as URL params to the next report. This approach is not very neat and there is a lot of possibility of mistake. The report looks something like below
Jasper, on the other hand, supports hyperlinks natively and it?s pretty easy to use and configure.
We can make any column clickable by adding hyperlink type to that column and the filters can be passed as hyperlink parameters to the line list report. The below picture shows the same report with the hyperlink configured to the ?Number of Individual? column.
Not able to have Reports in multiple languages
Metabase right now does not support creating reports in different languages. Avni is a multilingual platform and we wanted a way to reuse the same translations for our reports as well. To make the data and insights decentralised, it is important for it to be available in local language. In Jasper, we can create a resource bundle with all the keys and it?s translated values. This bundle then can be linked to a report and translated values can be accessed using a particular key. A sample report in Hindi looks like the image below.
Cascading Filters
There are situations where you need one filter to be populated based on another filter. E.g. State, District, Block, user hierarchy.
Metabase does not provide a way to setup something like this
as of now. So we have to populate each filter with all the values. If user chooses values in the filters such that the combination does not exist, you get empty results. This is not very user friendly. Jasper provides a way to set this up.
Apart from these listed features, there are a whole lot of other features like user designed layouts, the ability to put static text, user parameters, and more which makes Jasper a much better candidate for writing and designing complex and efficient reports without affecting the user experience. Although you get a lot in Jasper there are some downsides when you shift from Metabase and start using Jasper, especially if you are using community edition.
The powerful but out-dated user interface of Jasper.
We get styling out of the box in Metabase and it’s good. With Jasper, we have to work on styling ourselves and create report templates that can then be reused for similar kinds of reports.
Custom reports feature of Metabase where users can create a report from the UI without writing any query.
In Metabase, users can change the visualization or hide/show certain columns or perform conditional formatting which is not possible in Jasper.
An easy way to create a dashboard (Dashboards are not available in community edition)
To put everything together we can say that Metabase is limiting for developers but powerful for advanced end-users, and Jasper, on the other hand, is powerful for developers but limiting for advanced end-users.?
As I said earlier no product can satisfy all the use cases and it depends on the use case which product to use. Right now we are using these two reporting tools in Avni and we decide based on the requirements on the project.
We are still exploring GIS reports, and much more. Well, let?s keep that for our next blog post.Title: Women In Technology Fellowship

==================================================

This is a paid fellowship for women from technology institutions; we solicit candidates from all years of college. Tech4Dev runs this fellowship with its partners and focuses on engineering institutions from Tier II and Tier III cities.
The program mentors fellows in a wide range of non-tech related subjects such as written and oral communication in English, business communication etiquette and tech-related subjects such as digital technology, programming in general and Python and front-end technologies. The goal is to make them more confident, well-spoken and technically proficient candidates as they enter the workforce for internships and beyond.
Tech4Dev plans to run this fellowship in cohorts from engineering colleges in different parts of the country, The fellowship cohorts are run by two partners at a time: one partner providing mentoring on soft skills and one partner focusing on their technical development.
The first cohort is in the Tehri area with
Hyperverge Academy
(HVA) and ColoredCow. HVA on soft skills development and has deep experience in running such fellowships and they have demonstrated success in previous cohorts before this Tech4Dev cohort.
Technology mentoring and standups for the first cohort are managed by
ColoredCow
, a Tech4Dev partner with offices in Gurgaon and Tehri. ColoredCow manages the technology part of the curriculum, holds regular standups and guides the fellows in their technical advancement.
Our next cohort will be run by HVA and

==================================================

Just under five months ago, we launched the Women in Tech program in conjunction with our partners Colored Cow and Hyperverge Academy. Our goals were to mentor the young women in real-world software technologies and power skills such as communication, critical thinking, problem solving etc. and make well-rounded employees ready for real world internships and jobs; to expose them to new ideas, technologies and people that they wouldnt normally be exposed to in a college setting; and, to help make a dent in the gender disparity in the tech sector. As the program finishes its first semester, were happy with the progress so far — we’ll keep doing the things that went right and learn from the things that didn’t work so well.
In January recruited 21 first- through fourth-year students from THDC-IHET, an engineering college in Tehri after a rigorous interview process with some tough interviewers from Colored Cow and Hyperverge Academy. Over the past few months, weve seen these young women exceed our expectations; theyve been curious learners, theyve diligently worked through the problems assigned to them by their mentors and theyve written insightful
blogs
sharing their experiences. Their growth is in no small part because of their mentors from Colored Cow and Hyperverge Academy who have worked tirelessly to help them learn and grow. Kudos to the mentors and learners for successfully completing semester 1.
As we near the end of their academic year and their final exams, we are reflecting on the past five months and looking to the next few semesters of this program. This has been a semester of significant learnings from the program and introspection about what we set out to achieve. This reflection and introspection is already informing how we plan the next few semesters of this cohort and subsequent cohorts.
Looking Back, Looking Forward
The beginning months of the program went smoothly and flawlessly, thanks to the meticulous planning by Colored Cow and Hyperverge Academy; the learners were eager, engaged and enthusiastic. But over the past couple of months, uncertain college exam schedules, returning to in-person instruction, and, for some, going back to the college hostel with strict curfew rules has disrupted the rhythm of the program and threatened to lose the momentum we gathered thus far. Thanks to extra efforts by the mentors in making sure that the learners continued to stay engaged, the program has continued without major hiccups.
As with most such programs, we have seen our share of attrition. Early on, a couple of learners left the program for personal reasons and then, as the program has gone through its challenges, weve noticed that the overall engagement level is dropping. It might be due to the disruptions in their schedule, final exam stress or just life taking over, but we plan to talk to all the learners when they return from their final exams and evaluate who continues to the next semester.
Looking ahead, we plan to conduct regular feedback sessions with small groups of learners  and all the mentors. This feedback and our cohort 1 experience will also feed into the planning for our second cohort.
Weve begun the groundwork for our second cohort scheduled to begin in Sept/Oct 2022. We are running this cohort in Maharashtra with our partner Soft Corner; we plan to recruit women from colleges in Tier II cities such as Nashik, Sangli, and Satara.Title: Women in Tech- Recalling the Journey from start to the end?

Starting the Partnership
Since I joined
HyperVerge
in October of last year, we have undertaken several new initiatives and participated in numerous others. One such initiative began one fine day in February. We were going to partner with
Tech4Dev
and a company called
ColoredCow
that was offering to mentor learners and they also were going to get the learners. If this name stops you in your tracks, you might not be the only one. This is not the name of every other company. We asked the team to explain their reasoning and if you, the reader, are curious, you can read more about it
here
. I might botch the explanation and that wouldn’t do justice to their efforts. My only other experience working with college students was with another batch. Up till this point, we as a team had not thought of working with college learners for an extended period of time.
Why this partnership?
One of the most attractive reasons to partner with the team was their mission They wanted to improve the ratio of women in tech companies and identified that they can train women from the
THDC IHET
college campus that they are already affiliated with in Tehri, Uttarakhand.
Being an outskirts town, there was a possibility for the girls at this college do not have many opportunities. But another dire reason is that the learners did not have exposure to real-world tech projects. They had not done anything to implement their coding knowledge. As Michael Deng says in this article titled
,How to land a top-notch tech internship  and a tech job  while youre still in school
, it is important to start applying the fundamentals while being in college. It is also important to know what the tech companies are actually looking for. And so, what better place to start than a tech company that wants to mentor girls in a college town? This kind of exposure would be aimed to reduce the gaps in hiring and increase the training period so that the learners can take on large-scale projects before they even leave college. We were excited to start the intervention with
Tech4Dev
and
ColoredCow
called – Women in Tech.
Read more about it
here
Sourcing candidates with a Vision
We started the interview process rapidly and it went so smoothly. The entire team of
ColoredCow
set up the interviews, found the learners, got their profiles and sent it to
HyperVerge
team to conduct the interviews. They shadowed the calls and this was yet another unique experience. Usually, we conduct interviews in isolation with the candidate but this time around, we had another person shadowing the call and then we could discuss and debrief after the call got over. This was helpful for many reasons. Primarily, it helped us to come to a consensus and see some blind spots in each other’s thinking. Just like folks at HVA who love the work we do, every call with the CC team was a pleasant surprise. One of the interviewers, Akhilesh Negi, took his laptop and started showing around his office in Tehri which is located right next to the largest Dam in India.
It didnt feel like it was a work conversation, which is the best kind of work there is out there. Now, lets get the intervention started.
Intervention Period
The total intervention period for a learner varies in two ways. In the beginning of the program, we had identified learners who were interested in pursuing an internship with CC. But, naturally, life goes on and people change their minds. Some learners wanted to discontinue with this vision or wanted to explore other opportunities. We had determined that for the learners who were interested to complete the project, they would continue the online mentorship and for those who wanted to do an internship with the CC team, they would be required to work on-site at the office. Both offer exposure and both offer an opportunity to work on hands-on projects. The major difference accrued is in whether they are real-life projects or simulations. However, both have the benefits that a classroom cannot offer. It is a practical application of the concepts. In addition, working at the office gives the learners an opportunity to understand if they are a good fit for the working environment and shadow their mentors in real-life situations.
What is the major take-away of this intervention
Life may not go according to plan or the way we strategize. But what is better is to learn from the shortcomings and celebrate the wins as we see it. To quote an advisor for our team,
If you’re early on in your career and they give you a choice between a great mentor or higher pay, take the mentor every time. It’s not even close
. If learners take anything from the program, may it be that they have made some lifelong contacts and mentors to who they can reach out to for questions.
Till then, we will keep tweaking the intervention and hoping that more women get confident in pursuing careers in the tech industry. If we can give them hope that they are more than welcome and they belong here just as much as anyone else, then that would be a successful day.

==================================================

How can the CivicDataLab team help? Especially to teams new to remote working in the development sector
With each passing day Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading further and affecting millions of lives globally. In order to slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission, both
MoHFW
and
WHO
are urging people to practice social distancing and working from home. We understand most organizations working in the development sector are quite used to spending their majority of time in the field or brainstorming solutions with colleagues in the office. We hear from our partners that migrating to work from home is turning out to be quite a major challenge for individuals and teams alike. We really appreciate how most foundations globally have started to
alter their philanthropic commitments
to better support their grantee partners, but at the same time, we are sensing a need to enable our development sector workforce to be productive from home.
In such demanding times, most of us have come home to spend more time with family and loved ones, and working from home is turning out to be more challenging than we could have imagined. As the
lock-down periods are increasing
, there is a much stronger need to keep our anxiety and stress levels in check. We need to ensure that we, along with our loved ones take good care of our mental well-being and physical health. At the same time, it?s essential to keep ourselves occupied and continue to focus on working to solve crucial problems, something which keeps all of us motivated.
With an 11 member team (at the time of writing), CivicDataLab has always been a remote-first organization. We have accumulated some tested techniques and experiences of working remotely for the last 2 years. Our colleagues are currently working out of 9 districts spread across India, and we thought one of the ways we could help was to assist you in setting up a productive work environment in your home:
1.
We are offering help with your migration so you can Work Remotely yet Smoothly
If your team has recently migrated to working remotely and are still figuring out tools and processes to be more cohesive and productive, then we can help you! We are committing some time every week (a couple of online office hours) to help partners in the development sector. Drop us a note at
info@civicdatalab.in
and we will be happy to schedule a short discussion with your team to help you migrate better. We are also doing check-in calls with our current & future partners, and also re-looking at our project plans as we all prepare to respond to the COVID-19 situation.
2. Volunteering time to help organizations working on issues related to COVID-19
As
Jeni Tennison from ODI argues
, there is a need to open up data, research, models and other resources to collaborate and fight against this pandemic. Our friends at
Covid19india.org
,
DataMeet
and
DataKind Bangalore
have already begun remote collaborations to collate resources and do some analysis of the disease spread situation in India. This is possibly the best time for everyone to volunteer some hours and harness your skills to help remotely.
Are you an organization working to plan and execute rapid responses to the COVID-19 situation, specifically in India? Then we can help. We are parking a couple of hours every week to volunteer our time to remotely help organizations working on the current pandemic. The areas in which we can help are:
Data Mining and co-creating Open Data
Data Analytics, Monitoring, and Evaluation
Data Visualization, Dashboards and Reporting
Geospatial Analysis and GIS-related activities
Social Media Campaigns and Analytics
Annotations and Data-Driven Storytelling
Design Thinking and Research
Automated and Assisted Indian Language Translations ? we along with our network have some experience working with these 6 languages: Assamese, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.
Information dissemination and Chat-bots
Various open-source tech and data tools
If you are keen to collaborate with us on researching and responding to COVID-19 related issues then please drop us a note at
info@civicdatalab.in

3. Bandhu-ism: Be there for your Team
Working remotely can sometimes isolate you from your colleagues, giving you less opportunity to have required emotional bonding with your team. To avoid this, each member at CivicDataLab picks a
Bandhu
for themselves and is one for another teammate(s). Your Bandhu takes responsibility to ensure that you are mentally and physically well, making sure you are comfortable and in bright spirits at work. Bandhus wear multiple hats from being a personal growth hacker to being your agony aunt, they are there for you. They also help you get the work done when you are feeling low. Bandhus generally do weekly check-ins to discuss everything non-work, be it your current favourite dance jingle or recent book you are reading.
4. ScrumJi: Sharing responsibilities and planning effectively
Managing a remote team could be quite a cumbersome job, one needs to ensure a detailed oversight on how work in the organization is progressing, along with ensuring some regular housekeeping. This too much of an ask for one person to do it forever, especially in a small team like ours. Thus, we introduced the concept of
ScrumJi
? a monthly
round-robin
process to assign one team member as ScrumJi, being responsible to organize weekly team meetings, virtual standups, moderate teams, manage task boards, feedback and more. Read our bandhu
Swati?s blog
explaining her interesting journey for the month she became our ScrumJi. We have observed this rotation process makes everyone in the team slightly more empathetic about each other and balances out responsibilities. In these difficult COVID-19 times, our current ScrumJi Apoorv is using our team check-ins to ensure and boost the energy levels of our members and plan ahead as per the situation.
5. Tools for Online Team Collaboration
It?s very essential to have the right set of tools to enable online seamless collaboration among your peers. Here are some of our favourites for you:
Rocket.Chat
: We use this open-source team chat software to have important discussions, partner conversations, curating ? news, tech solutions, research, music, books, and all other chitter-chatter.
Taiga
: This open-source project management tool for multi-functional agile teams, giving you key features like Scrum, Kanban, Wiki and more.
Github
and
Gitlab
: These collaborative version-controlling platforms help us manage our codebase, documentation, designs and other things that require community participation.
G-Suite
: We constantly use Gmail, Google Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and other components of G-Suite to support team collaboration. Most of our Scrum calls, bandhu calls and partner calls happen at
Hangouts Meet
and occasionally on
Zoom
.
We strongly encourage reliance on more open-source tools and self-host them on our servers to have more control over our data. Though we still rely on some proprietary tools, we are constantly looking for robust open-source alternatives to them. If you have a suggestion for us then please drop us a note at
tech@civicdatalab.in
, we will be keen to speak to you.
6. Assistance for Home Office Setup
We work to ensure that our bandhus have a comfortable home office to work effectively. We currently offer assistance of
?
25,000 per annum to every member to set up essentials like good internet connection (possibly a fibre optic connection with 10?12 Mbps and monthly usage limits of 40?50 GBs), comfortable ergonomic chair and desk, noise-cancelling headphones, microphones and more as per their need. We urge organizations migrating to work remotely to try allocating some basic budget to enable home office setup assistance to all your staff members.

Michael Jastremski
We also have some allowances for
Personal Growth & Development
that broadly cover expenses on online courses, software licenses, summer schools, workshops, events & conferences. Lastly, some parked allowances for
Wellness
covering gym membership, yoga therapy, mental health counseling, music and dance lessons, and related activities for the well being of our members. Some of these activities are now being continued via online subscription during the precautionary lock-down period.
7. Doing Quarterly Retreats and Planning Online
Every quarter we organize a week-long in-person retreat and we call it
CivicDays
. Team members, from various locations, come together to stay and work at one place. As a team, we reflect back the quarter, onboard new members, brainstorm ideas, build roadmaps for the next quarter, and sometimes address issues that remain unattended. We do a few team bonding activities as well like , cooking together, playing games, trekking and more. Given the current lock-down situation, we are planning to do this quarter?s CivicDays online (no more beautiful AirBnb?s ?). We are aiming to conduct our quarterly review and planning sessions in a spread of two weeks, parking a few days and dedicated hours for key discussions and decision making. Our bandhus Divya and Preethi are helping us organize our first ever remote CivicDays. We also look forward to spend some time playing board games, watching movies simultaneously and maybe even trying an online version of Dungeons and Dragons! We will keep you posted on how this goes.
8. Let?s be EXTRA Mindful of our peers
Pandemics like these affect each person differently, we request everyone to show some extra love and affection to everyone, including people at work. Take out some time from your schedule to touch base with your team members and to talk about how they and their families are feeling. Conduct some group calls to plan responses to this ever-changing situation together as a team, with enough time for everyone to share their views and ideas. Also, one of the perils of remote working is sometimes your emotions are not properly communicated over chat/text, for most important conversations make sure to schedule an audio/video call so that you can understand the energy levels of your peers. P.S. Emojis do help, use them slightly more often.?
Moreover, make sure you encourage your teammates to have some time parked for themselves. Times like these can cause a lot of anxiety and stress, thus our team members are taking out some time for some activities like ?
Mini Anapana Meditation
,
Journaling
, 30 mins home exercise, weekend matinees with family, indoor games and more.
9. Ensure adequate family time
Working from home sometimes comes at certain unforeseen costs, one of them being a difficult work-family balance. For some folks, working from home may result in spending less time with family members. In current circumstances, our bandhus are parking some time off to do the following activities with their family members ? group video calls, exchanging live food recipes, touching base with relatives in the extended family. We are planning to experiment and bring some of our family members in for our future all team calls, giving them opportunities to meet humans on the other side of the screens.
I guess all of us acknowledge in our hearts, that these are extraordinarily difficult times for us, but how we together respond and come out of this, is going to define the humanity in us.

==================================================

As part of the Yenepoya HDSS project, we are developing Health and Demographics Surveillance System for Yenepoya Medical College. The project is done by configuring
Avni
. You can
read more details about the project here
.
Project status
Development and UAT for all the modules are complete and the app is ready to go live from next week.
Yeneopya Project Tracker
The development has been a very collaborative process between Samanvay and Yenepoya teams, with weekly demos, feedback and status checks. Yenepoya team has been very diligent in testing every part of the system and providing feedback. The app is also translated in Kannada and was also tested by field supervisors and field workers.
Discussing project progress in Yenepoya weekly call
Covid Impact
The project had brief pauses in between when the Yenepoya team got busy with emergencies due to COVID. Even the ‘Go live’ got delayed because of this. There are stigma and fear in the communities related to COVID. In our last weekly catchup, when discussing going live someone raised if communities will misinterpret this work as related to COVID and whether they will cooperate. But as the Yenepoya workers share a good rapport with the community, the team feels confident to move forward.
Sharing about the Work
In the month of July, we jointly conducted a webinar to share about the work done and encourage others to embark on this journey. The target audience were faculty from medical colleges and epidemiologists. It was well received and attended by more than 200 participants.
Faculty members from a college attending our webinar
The talk covered the following topics
What is health demographic surveillance system?
How EDC tools and IT platform boost/amplify the benefits of HDSS?
How to establish EDC tools and IT platform for developing HDSS? (Experience sharing (Yenepoya)
From Technology-based HDSS to clinical trials and longitudinal studies
Demo
Reviewing from IT Operations Lens – Security, Confidentiality, Scalability and more.
Q & A

Next Steps
We are now looking forward to the system going live and getting used by workers for actual work. There are always new and interesting learnings that come when the app goes to actual use. We will be keenly listening to any feedback coming from there both from project and platform perspectives and taking appropriate action.Title: गरुडमाची ~ टेक फॉर डेव्ह स्प्रिंट : एक शैक्षणिक पेहल

==================================================

This new year has brought fresh beginnings in many ways. Each of our projectsâ€”Glific, Dalgo, fcxo, and Avniâ€”is growing quickly, and our team is expanding too. This growth reassures us that weâ€™re heading in the right direction and gives us confidence to take new initiatives. After quite a bit of planning, weâ€™ve officially put together a team and kicked off our very own AI platform.
Briefly, we will be building a platform that makes it easy for our products (like Glific, Dalgo, and Avni), or any other NGO platforms, to integrate AI models through a straightforward API. Our platform acts as a simple layer that manages communication with AI providers like OpenAI, ensuring our products remain flexible, focused, and efficient. While at the same time, NGOs need not to rely on any product to
This blog is the trailheadâ€”the first of many to comeâ€”marking the beginning of a long journey for our AI platform. Over the past few months, weâ€™ve made significant strides. Although discussions and whiteboard planning have been ongoing, actual development began in February, and weâ€™ve made great progress since then.
Early on discussion on whiteboard from August, 2024

Accomplishments so far
Weâ€™ve had a lot of feature requests from different platforms and NGO usecases, plus a long wish list of our own. To keep things focused, weâ€™ve locked v1.0 around a single goal: move the existing AI implementation from Glific and Dalgo onto our new platform. Once that migration is solid, weâ€™ll revisit the roadmap and slot in the next wave of ideas.

Gratitudes
Firstly, to the Project Tech4Dev funders who have been super supportive from the very beginning. You are the reason this is happening ðŸ™‚
To the amazing partners collaborative we have build over the years at Tech4Dev. Everyone helped in shaping together the requirement document by sharing their usecase and things they want, may we continue growing stronger with another platform.

The day 3 in our Glific Sprint Goa commenced with a session led by Uhanjali and Dinella, during which we exchanged feedback on the enjoyable Sunday activity facilitated by Outdoor Mantra. Subsequently, we delved into a discussion on the 7 principles of Tech4Dev.
7 principles of Tech4Dev
Collaborate over Compete
– We are growing, Lots of work and experiments
Equality
– Treat everyone the same. An NGO should be treated the same as a funder.
Failure?
– Totally ok, Weve FAILED multiple times. Understand what happened
Truth
– Always be honest and upfront with everyone. Set expectations with NGOs/Supervisors ahead of time..
Responsibility
– Mid – Senior level team. Take ownership, drive things forward
Responsiveness
– Please be super responsive (< 24 hours, 1 business day)
Constructive criticism
– All of us can improve, we need our peers to let us know, nicely!
We formed seven groups, each with four members seated at a table.
Each table was assigned a principle, and our task was to discuss how we could relate that principle to our daily work life.
It was an opportunity for us to share thoughts and insights to better understand the principles in the context of our day-to-day professional experiences.
Additionally, Uhanjali and Dinella provided information on our company policies, covering aspects such as the leave structure and reimbursement cycle, ensuring everyone had a clear understanding of these policies, fostering transparency and clarity within the team.
SPRINT SALES ACTIVITY:
We began by arranging the hall for the “Chai Pe Charcha” sales activity. Different teams, including
Glific
on the left, Fcxo and Avni on the right, and Dalgo at the back, occupied different corners. Help desks were set up, where members of the Tec4Dev team assisted NGOs with their queries. There was also open space for thoughtful discussions.
At 2 PM, NGOs started arriving, and the event gained momentum. Local NGOs from Goa were excited to learn about the products, showing active engagement throughout the event. Since it was named “Chai Pe Charcha,” we served tea and snacks to encourage informal conversations. The event provided a great opportunity for collaboration.
Before leaving, NGOs were invited to share feedback about the event and products. It turned out to be a fantastic gathering, bringing everyone together for meaningful discussions and collaboration.

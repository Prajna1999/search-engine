==================================================

I joined Project Tech4Dev in October 2023, just as the organization was wrapping up its second year. At the time, I was excited to join a team building open-source technology for the social sector, and even more so to contribute to a product that had already gained considerable traction. Almost two years later, I find myself reflecting on how much has changed—not just in terms of what we’ve built, but how we’ve built it, together.

Glific team then:
Glific was thriving as a product platform and growing in numbers as a team. The senior leaders guiding the team had done well to support the team and the platform in the past couple of years. Values of openness and excellence were brewing strong when I joined. From the start, it was clear that the Glific team here was deeply invested in building something meaningful and useful for the social sector. Though to scale, grow and sustain Glific, we had to change the older ways a little.
Siloed Functions
When I came on board, Glific was structured around three primary teams: development, product and support, and sales and business development. These groups had fairly clear boundaries, both in terms of leadership and day-to-day operations. The development team was led separately from the rest, and they held their own standups. Product and support were grouped together, and sales operated with its own rhythm. While this setup wasn’t inherently flawed, it did mean that information, priorities, and context didn’t always flow across teams. It was very possible to be doing great work in your area while having little to no idea what another part of the organization was focused on.
Despite that fragmentation, the product itself was in a strong place. It had grown to support over 65 active bots, many of which were being used by social impact organizations across India and beyond. The platform had already proven it could scale to a moderate level and was stable enough to support meaningful engagement. There was a growing list of feature requests and product improvements coming in from partners, internal stakeholders, and the community. But the way we decided what to build—and who was involved in those decisions—needed evolution.
Engineering led Product
At the time, the development roadmap was largely led by the engineering team. They were deeply familiar with the architecture, quick to prototype, and efficient at building. Product and support were occasionally looped in for clarifications or validations, but the process lacked a structured handover or joint planning framework. Sales and support, meanwhile, were often downstream from these decisions, unaware of what was being developed or when something was going live. There wasn’t a single source of truth for upcoming releases or priorities, which made it difficult for them to plan conversations with partners or train support staff effectively. Moreover, the way the team operated didn’t give anyone other than the dev team the backing to give their opinion without having the fear of failing. Hardline from the dev leadership pushed the other tracks to fall in line. Priorities developed into the platform were most times informed by NGO needs (at least in initial years), but prioritization was adhoc, mostly a single person making the call.
Fragmented Leadership
Product and Biz dev had a separate senior leader than Dev, with very different style of leadership and priorities. One was methodical and intentional, almost driving perfection and the other was biased for action to deliver fast with least process. This confused the teams, who didn’t really have high level values and principles to go by. Most decisions made within the team were run by both leaders, eventually slowing things down.
Questioning leaders was also not a norm. Very few members actually did so. Even though the org would push people to give their opinion and question decisions, senior leadership’s answers either appeared to be dictating, opinionated or at times questioning seemed like insubordination.
Scale and Growth meant Change:
The first chapter in Glific’s story had set the stage and was closing, with the next chapter looking at making the foundation stronger, before building on top – After observing the structure for a few weeks, I began to document some of the friction points I saw—not in a critical way, but as constructive feedback with suggestions for improvement. My goal wasn’t to slow anyone down; it was to make our processes more inclusive and transparent, so that everyone had the context they needed to do their job well. I also had to ensure I don’t bring in processes for the sake of it, especially since I used them at Amazon, and they worked. I had to ensure I listened first and advised later; keeping in account the team and its members before pushing changes in. I shared these notes with leadership, and to their credit, they took the feedback seriously and encouraged me to implement some of the proposed changes.
Blurring Boundaries, Unifying Silos
What followed was a slow but steady reorientation in how we worked as a team. We didn’t tear anything down overnight. Instead, we started by integrating some basic rituals—like including product representation in dev standups daily. It sounds small, but simply having dev and product in the same virtual room each morning made a huge difference. This alignment fostered a new level of empathy and reduced the surprises on all sides. After a few months, I also started indicating to the senior leaders that the standups could be less formal and would not need their time; this was to mitigate the observer effect in the team. I observed how the standups flowed smoothly when leadership didn’t attend these standups, while when they did, abrupt questions from them digressed the team’s standup. Instead I decided to update the leadership about weekly and monthly decisions and KPIs through weekly updates doc (if they were curious) and monthly review meetings, with ownership rotating among the team.
Transparent Prioritization
We also introduced a more transparent planning and prioritization process. We moved toward a shared backlog and open discussions around what we should build next and why. Individuals would brainstorm for a bottom up roadmap or feedback from partners, and we worked together to evaluate what made sense for the product, what was feasible technically, and what had the greatest potential impact. Product started playing a more central role in facilitating these conversations, ensuring that trade-offs were clear and that everyone had a voice.
Open Communication
Another important shift was the introduction of regular demo sessions. Before any new feature was released, we’d walk through it together—developers showing what they built, product explaining the use case, and support and sales flagging any questions or potential confusion. These sessions weren’t just about checking boxes; they created a loop of feedback that helped catch issues early and improve usability. It also gave support and sales time to prepare documentation, training, or partner communication before anything hit production. Overtime fCxOs attending these sessions have helped immensely in reconsidering some design decisions and use cases before things are baked in.
Over time, we saw our structure shift from a collection of teams to a truly cross-functional unit. We began to take more collective ownership of the product, the process, and the outcomes. Developers started asking questions about user behavior and partner feedback. Support folks contributed to product design. Sales team members helped clarify edge cases and offered real-world examples that improved our user flows. Instead of gatekeeping information, we were sharing it. Instead of handing off tasks, we were collaborating. A defining moment for me personally in witnessing this collaboration was the 2024 Accelerator, where the entire team came together. Nothing was tossed over the wall and forgotten, the 3 month initiative from marketing to final demo was overseen by a single-threaded-owner, and everyone owned their part. I felt so proud to be part of the Glific team!!
Autonomy = Experiment—>Fail-Iterate-Innovate
I strive to bring accessibility to leadership for everyone in the team, with a level of comfort that allows them to question decisions and state their opinions. This is a gradual transition that I still don’t see in the lesser tenured members in the team. Everyone in the team
has a level of autonomy
that enables them to
experiment and innovate. I hope to see everyone leverage it.
This autonomy is not about doing whatever one wants, but about knowing that every individual owns and has “founded” the organization. Their decisions pave the way and it comes with equal amounts of responsibility and accountability. I’ve seen individuals in the team grow in their career over these past 2 years, with this added autonomy and trust that has been bestowed upon them. Do they make mistakes, yes of course! But we learn from them, and it allows the team to know they can take risks, and should not be afraid of failing. The senior leaders at Project Tech4Dev have also given me similar autonomy, which I don’t take lightly. I look forward to the Glific team thriving and innovating in the space available to them at Glific and Project Tech4Dev.
Coaching and Mentoring
As a people manager, one of the things I truly cherished was my 1:1s with my managers and teams. I knew how important consistent weekly or bi-weekly catch-ups were to individuals. Even though some would not open up and have much on their agenda, if I missed any 1:1, I would hear from them to schedule one soon. I didn’t see this as a norm in Tech4Dev. Most catch-ups happened in sprints, which were quarterly. Some lucky ones happened monthly. Knowing how much 1:1s play a part in motivating the team, I wanted to make it a norm with all my directs. For over a year I also met with my skip-levels monthly. But now that I see my managers growing into their people manager shoes, I have made my skip levels into office hours. I hear back quite frequently of how much my team looks forward to these 1:1s (as much as I do), and knowing it helps the individual and ripple effects on the entire team’s motivation, makes me ensure I never skip one.

Today
This transformation wasn’t perfect or linear. We had to work through overlaps in responsibility, conflicting priorities, and different communication styles. But the key was that we were committed to working through it together. Leadership supported the transition, encouraged experimentation, and gave teams the autonomy to define new processes. That level of trust created space for us to take initiative and improve things organically, rather than waiting for top-down directives.
Now, nearly two years in, the way Glific operates feels fundamentally different. We make faster decisions, not because we cut corners, but because we’re more aligned and empowered. Everyone knows what’s being built, when it’s shipping, and why it matters. We still have room to grow—we always will—but the foundation feels stronger than ever. We’ve moved from reacting to requests to proactively shaping the product in ways that reflect the needs of our partners and users.
Reflecting on this journey, I’m proud of the changes we’ve made—not just in the platform, but in the culture. We’ve gone from a well-meaning but disjointed setup to a unified team that’s more resilient, responsive, and deeply collaborative. Invariably, change also means loosing on some of the positive aspects of a smaller team that functioned like a new startup. With the founding member and a couple of developers, we could whip out a decently large feature in a few weeks. With a fairly new dev team and added operational and customer support responsibilities, that velocity has gone down. Though this trade-off seems fair and balanced for now, given that Glific’s USP is a fast and comprehensive support and features being pushed out are prioritized on usage and impact; we do need to stay agile and increase the velocity of building and experimenting as we push on.
Looking ahead, I’m excited about what’s next. We have a lot to improve on, big ambitions for the product, more organizations to support, and plenty of challenges to solve.
I would like to attribute the openness in this post to the senior leaders of Project Tech4Dev, who are willing to be open to critical feedback and live the org values of Openness, Transparency, and Trust in their day-to-day. I hope each and everyone (incl. myself) is able to take something away from them and carry this culture on, ourselves, everyday!

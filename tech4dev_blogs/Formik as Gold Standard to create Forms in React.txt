==================================================

React
is one of the most popular frontend frameworks that powers millions of websites. It has a great open source community and numerous packages that make frontend development extremely easy. In this blog, I’ll cover a peculiar aspect of React that is still difficult for developers. It is building
forms
. . The most challenging part about it is managing the state, validation, showing error messages
There are many
React Form libraries
which make coding
forms
easy. Some of the widely used ones are
formik, react-hook-form, redux-form
and
react-final-form
. The most popular among them is
Formik
, in fact, it is recommended by the React Community.
On FundImpact platform, we have deployed
Formik
to create Forms and ensured we spend less time in reinventing the wheel. The great thing about
Formik
is that it is very easy to use. The motto of
Formik
is “React forms without the tears!” and I think it has done a great job in achieving that.
Formiks
clean API lets us use it without worrying about a lot of state management.
Regarding Validations, we can use any 3rd party library. I would recommend
Yup
for object schema validation.
Yup
is one the best validation libraries and
Formik
gives us out of the box support for
Yup
validations which makes it more programmer friendly.
Formik gives us various kinds of props and we can pass these props to our form elements to manage validation and submissions.
We can pass initial values of the input elements, validation function, onSubmit function to Formik.
How to Install
In order to install formik we can use the following commands
npm install formik –save
or
yarn add formik
Import formik to your project
In order to import formik do this
import { Formik } from “formik”;
We pass initial values to F
ormik
and it will modify the values automatically with the help of the
onChange
function. We also pass validation function as props. The validation function will receive the values of the form as parameter and it will return an error object which will help us to show error messages.
The validation function looks like the following:-
Formik component will look like this
On every keystroke validation function would be called and errors object will contain all validation errors at any given moment.In our component, we are just checking if an error exists and then immediately showing it to the user. Most of the time, we only want to show a field’s error message after our user is done typing in that field.Like values and errors formik keep track of the fields that have been visited and it does that with the help of touched object. We can use the touched object to solve this problem.
Final thoughts
Formik provides very optimized state management which reduces performance issues, its very easy to build dynamic forms with Formik. Stay tuned for more updates on this blog for tips and tricks on using Formik libary.

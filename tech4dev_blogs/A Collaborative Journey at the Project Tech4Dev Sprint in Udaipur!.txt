Hey there! As the Communications Head at Prod, I recently had the privilege of being a part of an extraordinary event – the Project Tech4Dev sprint in the beautiful city of Udaipur. And let me tell you, it was one of a kind experience that blew me away!
Picture this – a formal yet informal setting, where stakeholders from across the spectrum – donors, NGO partners, friends, and of course, us – gathered to work collaboratively and drive meaningful change. Stepping into the world of offline collaboration with Sprint was an eye-opening experience. This event organized by Project Tech4Dev, served as a platform for learning, networking, and witnessing firsthand the impactful contributions made by non-profit organizations. The concept of a Sprint in the Indian development sector was a first, and it was incredible to witness the collective passion to inspire social change.
At Prod, we are always on the lookout for impactful initiatives, and Project Tech4Dev truly impressed us. Their use of tech platforms like Glific to resolve communication-related challenges faced by NGOs left us in awe. It’s amazing to see how tech need not be intimidating; instead, it can amplify the impact of social interventions.
The best part? Project Tech4Dev has created a warm, safe, and happy space for this community to thrive. They reinforce a collaborative approach towards work and social good, and I’m genuinely thankful for the environment they’ve fostered.
During the sprint, our team conducted a storytelling workshop, sharing the art of communicating impact to invite more participation towards the cause. The level of participation and commitment in the room was simply heartwarming, and it fueled our motivation to drive social change even further.
And let’s not forget the morning walks in the picturesque city of lakes! It was a breath of fresh air – soothing, fun, and the perfect opportunity to meet old and new friends while building upon the body of work.
I’m already looking forward to the next Sprint, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this amazing community of changemakers. Together, we are making a real difference, and that’s something to celebrate!

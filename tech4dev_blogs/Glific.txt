Insights and Experiences from Our Valued Partners
Chatbot significantly saved time by automating sending of messages to a large group of people. It has provided great support and helped us to offer career guidance to students, teachers, and parents in schools and areas where Antarang does not conduct programs.

After attending the accelerator, we were attracted to the features of the chatbot. Even though our team isn't tech-savvy, we felt confident in our ability to use it. All our stakeholders saw the value, which encouraged us to fully commit to the chatbot.
